# Site home

Welcome aboard. This is mostly a blank home page thing so there's a "default". It will likely change soon once I have made some more steps into figuring this whole shebang out. For now here is a photo so I can tell that works.

If you can see this bit, then the latest sync has worked on the morning of 19/03/2025 and hopefully *has not* added any extra folders to the explorer?

Don't get impatient, give it a minute or 5 to deploy, ya numpty!
