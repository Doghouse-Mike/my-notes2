Spent XP, onto the ship!

Met Moxley the Quermian

Gambled all his money off him and he legged it. 

Got interdicted and pulled out of hyperspace. Imps en route to board us. 3 transports, 30 troopers each. 

We got the control rod for the ships compliment of six astromechs. Liberation frequency

Need to find out where we are (are escape pods an option?). Astrogation check? Is there anywhere to even escape to, or is this a deep space situation?

Talk to Routh, see what's going on, if she knows *why*

Got a cutter, can theoretically go *through* walls rather than having to stick to doors and corridors. Ed in vacuum?
