# Fully Operational - Engineers

REPAIR AND CONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS E ngineers work to maintain the arms and vehicles of the Rebellion's forces, which means more than per- forming equipment maintenance work in a secure han- gar. Sometimes, Alliance tech experts need to enter dangerous situations or exotic environments to salvage a cra shed fighter, get a stalled speeder run ing again, or do any number of other vital but hazardous tasks in the field. In such situations, the difference between working in an uncontrolled environment-possibly even an active combat zone-and bustling about a workshop shows itself in many ways. This section details how working in different sorts of environments can impact Mechanics checks to repair gear, use com bat engin ee rin g, or perform ot her vita l ta sks. These environments are typically hostile to the work of an Engineer, but they might provide some limited bonuses or opportunities to spend positive dice results alongside the penalties and restrictions of such dangerous work. The main goal of these rules is to provide new ways to keep the lives of Engineer PCs challenging and exci ting. not to prevent them from doing their job. At the CM's discretion, some or all of the modifiers for an envi ronm ent might not app ly to a particular check. ACTIVE BATTLEFIELD Although the Rebellion generally avoids full -scale mili- tary engagements against the Empire, somet imes it is forced into a major confrontation to cove r the evacua- tion of a discover red base, or when a plann ed surprise attack is anticipated. The efforts of the Rebell ion's Engineers are necessary in these con flicts in order to keep fighting vehicles operational and to ensure losses of materiel are as limi ted as possible. Working on an active battlefield may impose up to •• on checks other than those involving personal equipment, depending on how close to the front lines the Engineer is and t he fi erceness of any nea rby com - bat. Even ope rating at the very outskirts of a battle, fa r away from any actual combat, could d impose . from interrupted resupply shipments or power fail- ures. However, checks to salvage spare parts might receive 0 instead, as replacement materiel and gear should be easy to find. Depending on the location of the battle, other modifiers for environmenta l facto rs (such as those follOWing) may apply as well. The CM can also decide to upgrade t he diffic ulty of Mechanics and Computers checks, based on the effort required and the current t battlefield situation. CRAFTING VICTORY FULLY OPERATIONAL If a Mechanics check made on an active battlefield results in ~, stray blaster fire or shrapnel might strike the Engineer or the Engineer's project, either inflict- ing a Critical Injury on the Engineer or damaging the item by one level (see Table 5-4 : Repairing Gear on page 172 of the ACE O F REBELLION Core Rulebook), at the CM's discretion. DESERTITUNDRA Working in an isolated, desolate environment is rarely a problem for Rebel Engineers, as long as the Alli- ance's supply lines remain able to reach them . The solitude keep s their work undist urbed, which is a rare adva nta ge for engineers in the field. However, extreme temperatures and blowing sands or snow might necessitate an environmental seal around the Engineer's workshop. Any checks to main- tain or repair equipment or vehicles made in such conditions without the protection of a sealed work- place suffer • . Additionally, improvising stable cover STRUCTURED TIME AND DIFFERENT ENVIRDNMENTS T he suggested modifiers in this section are applicable both in and out of structured time. In certain cases, some environments might lend themselves to working in struc- tured time, but the scene should move at the pace appropriate to the PCs' actions, as struc- tured and narrative time are both tools to sup- port certain kinds of actions. Simply being in the presence of combat is not enough to force the PCs into structured time. Instead, the CM should use structured time if it assists in orga- nizing the actions of the PCs and other char- acters present. An Engineer repairing com- bat vehicles on the outskirts of a battlefield would not use structured time, but one trying to jump-start a getaway speeder before being found by pursuing Imperial forces likely would. When the party is operating in structured time, some of the environmental pressures described here might increase at the GM's discretion, and certain large-scale projects could become impossible due to the difficulty of completing them within the constraints of a single encounter.
