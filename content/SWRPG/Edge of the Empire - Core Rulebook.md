# Edge of the Empire - Core Rulebook

IN TR O D U C TIO N "Much to learn, you still have." -Yoda B o u n ty hunters! Run!" I bolted. I d id n't need to be told again. They weren't taking me back to Logron. Ahead. Sona decided the sun­ drenched alley was too exposed and dove into a shad­ owed archway. "Come...argh!” the Bothan groaned, suddenly reap­ pearing as she bounced off something hard, landing on her back in the sandy street. I slowed to a jog. grabbed her hand, and yanked her back to her feet w ithout stop­ ping. "D idn't see the door. Too dark," she cursed. As we picked up speed, she pressed something into my hand. A blaster pistol. "So. now you trust me?" I asked.. "Barely Just point it at the bounty hunters." She looked behind us. Our twisting path through Mos Sluiuta's alley ways blocked the hunters from view. I m omentarily pan­ icked as a pair of humanoid figures sprinted around the corner, but I quickly realized they were Sona's friends, the Pero brothers. At least. I thought the Twi'leks were her friends. I barely knew any of them. Stun bolts buzzed by the Twi'leks as they turned the cornei The hunters were much too close for comfort. We all ran harder. At least the stun bolts told us they wanted us alive...for now. "There's no way Logron's hunters could find us that fast!" I yelled at Sona. We had escaped Logron’s des­ ert farmstead hideout less than an hour before, after we smashed his comm gear and took the only speeder. Logron (all-around scum, m inor crime lord, and illegal bounty hunter kingpin) had left unexpectedly, and we seized the o p p ortu nity to break out of our makeshift cell. His otherwise-inept guards managed to blast the landspeeder as we zipped away. Its repulsorlift died five minutes outside Mos Shuuta. crashing us into a conve­ niently-located sand dune. "They're not Logron's." Sona shouted back. ”1 think they're after the Pero brothers. Coson and Reis must owe someone BIG. They always attract bounty hunters." The Twi'leks caught up to us when we slowed to turn down a side street. The older one, Coson. replied, "If they're after us. they're new. Don't recognize them " A barrage of stun bolts announced the hunters' reacquisi tion of their targets. Us. Sona pointed up toward a tall structure that dwarfed the buildings around us. "There’s the bay! Co left!” A throng of people clogged the cramped outdoor market street ahead. Sona led us down a parallel side street. We emerged near a cliff, face—not unexpected, given that Mos Shuuta covered the top of a small mesa. We turned right, expecting to run between the buildings and the cliff edge, but a towering, teetering stack of crates and junk blocked the way. "Wonderful," groaned Reis. The hunters would be here in moments. I grabbed Reis' wrist. "Come on, we’ll skirt around the outside. Just don’t push me off the cliff!” I turned side­ ways, as there was just enough of a ledge to get around the junk. I tried to touch the pile as little as possible. Predictably, Reis slipped and panicked. He grabbed the nearest stable thing to save himself—me. I seized his hand and his momentum yanked me towards the edge. I clutched the pipe I’d been using to balance myself, but it found-no footing in the pile. The edge under Reis’ feet crumbled and suddenly I was holding us both, dangling by one arm from the pipe. The pipe finally caught on something and held, but both it and my arm threatened to come loose at any moment. Then, Reis went limp. Unconscious. I began to curse him all the way to Ryloth when a stun bolt glanced off the pile nearby. I’d forgotten about the bounty hunters. They had hit Reis. I looked back and saw Sona halfway up the pile, returning fire from behind a smashed crate. Coson scrambled fearlessly across the ledge towards us. He grabbed his brother by the arm and we hauled him up. We slung him over my shoulder and I carried him to safety behind some of'the junk. The pile lurched as- Sona jum ped down to join us, having taken the high road over the top. She jammed some kind of stim into Reis. He began to revive, but not quickly enough. I peeked around the corner and saw the bounty hunt­ ers—Rodians—walking nimbly along the ledge. "Come on, Coson,” I yelled at the strong Twi’lek. "PUSH!" I low­ ered my shoulder and we slammed into the pile. A dozen random containers tumbled down on the Rodians just before the whole pile lurched and slid off the cliff side in an avalanche of junk. I didn’t see whether or not the Rodians went over with it. We ran. Sona defeated the landing bay door's security in m o­ ments. To my surprise, inside stood a very familiar, very worn freighter. It was disk-shaped, with its cockpit offset on the starboard side. Its color scheme of equal parts blue and rust seemed to visibly crack and fade in the bright sunlight that streamed in through the landing bay’s open top. Sona ran up the boarding ramp to the hatch. She punched in a code and the hatch sprung open. She sprinted toward the cockpit, leaving me and Coson to lead the staggering Reis into the ship. I strapped myself into the copilot's seat as the Rodi­ ans (or at least some of them) ran into the bay and we roared into the sky. As we cleared the atmosphere, and the horizon turned from blue to black, I turned to Sona, a question burning in my mind. I kept my hand on the blaster in my lap, but didn’t pick it up. N ot yet, anyway. "N o one could break into a ship that fast. How did you know the code to Logron’s ship?" Sona laughed. “It’s MY ship. I owed him some cash, and Logron decided to alter our deal and take the ship instead. The Pero brothers and I tracked him to the farm but got caught by some of his hunters. We figured out.too late the-ship was in Mos Shuuta." My mind raced with this unexpected turn. "How long have you owned this ship?” "Years.” My blaster came up instantly. Sona’s smile vanished. “ Hey, hold up, I told you to point that thing at bounty hunters." "I think I am. M y cousin disappeared six months ago on Tatooine, and she was last seen being taken aboard a blue freighter. This one. An informant in Mos Eisley told me Logron owned it and used it for bounty hunters. I found his hideout at the farm, but.his guards caught me and threw me in with you and the brothers. I don’t know or care what you’re mixed up in. I’m out here looking for my.cousin. If it's your ship, you know where she is." “I’m a smuggler, not a bounty hunter. Coson and Reis are my crewmates. Your cousin was in trouble with Jabba the Hutt, so I smuggled her offworld." Sona sighed, “You know, I always regret coming to Tatooine.” “ I’m sure you do,” said a voice from behind us. We spun around, and I instinctively aimed my blaster at the in­ truder. "As do I. Regret your coming here, that is. You’re trouble." A tall, well-dressed human with short black hair and a full board stood in the cockpit doorway, his blaster aimed at us. It was Logron. In the rush, we hadn’t checked the ship. He could have been almost anywhere onboard. “You did me no. favors leading my Rodian ex-partners right to me. Now, you will land this thing at Mos Ei.s...” He trailed off, staring out the. cockpit window behind me and Sona, which suddenly glowed. We turned to see the bright white triangular hull of an Imperial Star Destroyer, which had just dropped out of hyperspace. I turned around and shot the scum. Logron fell to the deck, stunned. Unconscious. Sona looked from me, to the blaster, to Logron, to the Imperial ship outside. She smiled broadly and said, “You know, I think you're right. Today I am a bounty hunter. I bet those Rodians knew something we didn't about Logron. Let’s make a few credits, then see to your cousin." Sona grabbed the comlink microphone. “Captain Sona Fey'lya of the Blue Flare to Imperial Star Destroyer. You have great timing. I'd like to claim an Imperial bounty. Shall we deliver, or do you want to pick up?" WELCOME TO ROLEPLAYING AT THE EDGE OF THE EMPIRE! I n the Edge of the Em pir e roleplaying game, you’re part character, part storyteller, and part improvisational ac­ tor. You simultaneously create and play through fantas­ tic Star Wars stories filled with action, suspense, space battles, and more than a few stormtroopers, smugglers, bounty hunters, and Hutt crime lords. In E dge of the Em ­ pire, you play characters at the fringes of civilized space or society—usually both. To play the game, you need your imagination, this book, paper and pencil, some Star Wars Edge of the Empire dice, and several other players. Before you begin, you need to decide which member of your group will play as the Game Master (GM). While not a permanent decision, the role of GM does not gener­ ally change from one game session to the next, and the Game Master has several responsibilities that the rest of the players do not. I'M TH E GAME MASTER! W H A T DO I DO? Running a roleplaying game is a lot of fun. The GM runs the game, provides the basic story plot, plays the char­ acters the players meet, describes the surroundings, and adjudicates the rules. A good GM must think on his feet. The GM responds to unexpected actions from the play­ ers and adjusts the story as the players come up with the best way to resolve the situation they have encoun­ tered. Your number one job is to make sure everyone has a good time. Fun first, rules second. I'M A PLAYER! W H A T DO I DO? As a player, you take on the role of an individual charac­ ter, referred to as the Player Character (PC). You usually create a Player Character for yourself at the beginning of the game, but the Game Master may provide a pre­ generated PC for you. Your Player Character takes part in an adventure, analogous to episodes of a television show or individual movies wherein you play part of the recur­ ring cast. Adventures last for one or more game sessions. WHERE DO I START? D ifferent parts of this Core Rulebook will serve as a good starting point depending on wheth­ er you will be playing Edge of the Em pire as the Game Master or as a Player Character. Players should begin by reading Chapter I: Play­ ing the Game and can then dive right into Chap­ te r II: Character Creation. The Game Master should also begin with Chapter I: Playing the Game but can then move on to Chapter IX: The Game M aster With each adventure, your character gradually becomes better at what he or she does, and the story evolves with and around all the characters. Player Characters in E dge of the Em pire are typically from the rough-and-tumble side of the galaxy, but they don’t have to be. You use the rules to create the kind of character you want to play, and you develop it by playing the role you envision. You might play a character based on someone found in the Star Wars movies and stories, but most players use a combination of abilities and backstory to create a charac­ ter unique to them. For example, the opening story featured a common Player Character type—Sona, a smuggler whose deal with a criminal benefac­ tor turned sour, forcing her and her crew to take dras­ tic action to regain their ship. The Pero brothers and the story’s nar­ rator could be played by oth­ er players. Your smug­ gler might run con­ traband to Imperial worlds while dodging Star Destroyers and stor- mtroopers. You could be­ come a Rodian bounty hunter, chasing down the scum of the universe for profit. O r you could be a dis­ graced human noble or politi­ cian on the run from the Empire and fending off accusations of being a rebel sympathizer... accusations which might be true! When you create your character, you will need to con­ sider your backstory: where did your character come from? What does he do now and why? What does he want to do next? The game includes ways to inspire backstory development through roleplaying motivations and obligations to other individuals. Your PC has a spe­ cific Obligation that influences him regularly—maybe he owes a crime lord thousands of credits, must repay a big favor, or is dedicated to his family or organization. On the seedy side of galactic society, you can’t help but owe someone something. You also create a personality, one which might be very similar to yourself, or very different from anything you’ve known. The heart of a roleplaying game is taking on the role of your Player Character, and acting in a manner be­ fitting the character’s situation, history, and aspirations. Backstories and personalities can be as complex or sim­ ple as you like, so long as you and your fellow players are having a good time. Once you have a Player Character, you play as part of a group, usually comprising four to six players. Your character's backstory might mesh with theirs (perhaps they are related, or all serve aboard the same ship), or they might be allies of the moment, thrown together by circumstances beyond their control. When you play, each member of the group controls his own Player Character. The Came Master plays the part of everyone else the PCs encounter, work with, or fight. (These are called Non-Player Characters, or NPCs.) The CM also embroils the group in the adventure. The CM might create a story or plot, or the group could dictate their own journey. M ost games are a combination of both. During the adventure, you tell the GM what you want your Player Character to do. You might use accents or unusual voices like an improvisational actor, but it’s per­ fectly fine to simply say what you want to do and let the GM respond. Don’t worry about knowing all of the rules of the game im m ediately—you’ll learn from the GM and other players as you go, although reading the Edge of the Em pir e Core Rulebook is helpful. Having a good time is more im portant than following every rule to the letter. WELCOME TO THE GALAXY! It is a tim e of civil war...and much more. Every day, the growing Rebellion threatens the Galactic Empire on new battlefields and political arenas, fighting for hearts and minds throughout the galaxy in th eir bid for free­ dom. Beyond the Rebellion, the rest of the galaxy goes about its business. Some hope to stay out of the line of fire, but others p ro fit from the conflict. The m ost un­ lucky beings are caught in tyrannical Imperial policies th a t repress freedom and enslave entire species. The desperate and the opportunistic seek the edges of the Empire, finding refuge in social, eco­ nomic, and legal grey areas in the remote parts of the galaxy. EXAMPLE OF PLAY F rank, George, Harper, Isabelle, and Jackie have gathered together to play Edge of the Empire around Frank's dining room table. Frank and George are playing Twi’leks: Coson the Hired Gun and Reis the Technician. Harper is playing Mills, a human Col­ onist. Isabelle is playing Sona, a Bothan Smuggler. Jackie is acting as the Game Master (GM). We join the group mid-session as they arrive in Mos Shuuta... Jackie (GM): It takes five minutes to walk from your crashed speeder to the foot of the great stone bridge leading up to the Mos Shuuta mesa. It takes another ten to climb all the way up to the town itself. Fifteen minutes hiking in the Tatooine sun is enough to tire everyone; you all suffer two strain (Everyone marks that they’ve suffered two strain on their char­ acter sheet.) Frank (Coson): I hate this planet. Let’s get out of here. Isabelle (Sona): We should try to find a ship. M ay­ be we can book passage off-world at the cantina— this town must have a cantina, right? Jackie (GM): Sure. The first Jawa you ask on the street points you towards the cantina. H arper (Mills): We should be cautious about this. I’ll hang back from the group and keep an eye out. Logron’s thugs could be right behind us. Jackie (GM): Good idea. The cantina is a low pourstone building, like m ost of the rest of the town. It’s sunken a b it into the rock of the mesa and is much cooler than the hot streets. There is a collection of aliens of all types scattered around the main room, and the Devaronian bartender sneers at you as you approach. Isabelle (Sona): Okay, I guess we work the room and see who might know where we can get a ride off of this rock. Somebody must be a pilot for hire. Frank (Coson): Hire? With what money? We’re broke, remember? Isabelle (Sona): Details. We’ll figure that out later. Jackie (GM): Okay, this will be a Streetwise check. What do you do? W hat do you say? Isabelle (Sona): I start with the bartender, I guess. “ Hey, you handsome devil. I like your cantina; it must be the first port-of-call for every spacer in town." George (Reis): I’ll sit with my brother at a table near the middle of the room where we can see and hear as many people as possible. Maybe someone’ll let something interesting slip while Sona’s doing her gladhanding. Jackie (GM): Okay, that’s a pretty good icebreaker. This will be an Average difficulty Streetwise check. Reis and Coson’s extra eyes and ears are worth a Boost die, and take another for good roleplaying. (Isabelle gathers dice based on various factors into a dice pool and rolls it.) Isabelle (Sona): Success, no Advantage or Threat Jackie (GM): Well, good news! The Blue Flare is in dock at Bay Aurek. Isabelle (Sona): The Blue Flare? I know that ship! Jackie (GM): Meanwhile outside, Mills, make me a Vigilance check. H arper (Mills): N ot exactly my strong suit. (Harper collects dice based on M ills’ Vigilance skill and chal­ lenge and difficulty dice provided by Jackie, then rolls.) Failure, but two Advantage. Jackie (GM): Alright, Mills. You don’t see the Rodi- an bounty hunters until you literally walk into them when you turn to step into the cantina. You and the Rodians go flying in opposite directions, tumbling to the ground as they shout out in recognition. Be­ cause of your Advantage, I’ll give you a free maneu­ ver before they can respond. H arper (Mills): Uh...uh... I duck into the cantina and shout for help! Frank (Coson): Oh, great A firefight in the cantina is the perfect cap to our terrible day. Jackie (GM): Roll for initiative! THE EMPEROR RULES The fearsome Empire dominates the galaxy politically, socially, and militarily. The Emperor maintains absolute control; he skillfully plays political games, using both the m ilitary and the dreaded Darth Vader to keep his choke- hold on the galaxy. The Imperial m ilitary is unmatched when deployed en masse. Imperial agencies m onitor the actions of opponents and allies alike. The feared Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) digs into any suspected corruption or rebel activity. Government-sanctioned political groups like the Commission for the Preservation of the New O r­ der (COMPNOR) promote Imperial ideals and harshly counter rebel propaganda and anti-imperial sentiment. Dominant though the Empire is, it is hardly monolithic or omnipresent, and the rebels, criminal organizations, corporations, and many others exploit that fact. THE GALACTIC CIVIL W A R RAGES ON! The rebels destroyed the Empire’s ultimate weapon, the Death Star! The loudest shot of the Galactic Civil War still reverberates throughout the galaxy. Viewed as a le­ gitimate new hope for the repressed and the persecuted, the Rebel Alliance battles Imperial forces every day. The rebels are locked in a desperate, winner-take-all battle with the Empire, with only a fraction of the m ilitary might they need. With each new success, the Rebellion spreads Sun deliveries and operations. Black Sun reaches from Coruscant, the capital world of Imperial Center, to the backwater planets and isolated worlds beyond Known Space. SHADY SHADOW PORTS A N D BLACK MARKETS Beneath the surface of legitimate com­ merce. Imperial bureaucracy, and regiment­ ed Imperial rule lies a teeming underworld of smugglers, con artists, black marketeers, and other criminals. Though officially condemned as hives of scum and villainy, the truth is that much of the galaxy engages with or even relies upon these grey market economies to survive. Isolated worlds sometimes have no other option, further blurring the line between legitimate enter­ prise and illegal trade. As stifling Imperial law and persecution increase throughout the galaxy, more people escape to the fringes just to survive or evade arrest. Shadowports provide trading ports, ship's servic­ es, and other key support for otherwise illegal activities. Shadowports are usually isolated and secret, but some foster illegal activities in larger, legitimate spaceports. Black markets offer virtually any legal or illegal item, so long as one can afford it. Smugglers sneak contraband past the ubiquitous Imperial customs inspectors, bringing banned items into Imperial worlds, or even sneaking fugi­ tives and rebel agents away from the Imperials. SURVIVING AT THE EDGE OF THE EM PIRE Life at the fringes of society and civilized space is tough. The edge of society can be found almost anywhere in the galaxy—from the most isolated backwater Imperial planet in the O uter Rim to the dank depths of the seedy lower levels of the Imperial capital city-world. The edge of society often corresponds to the edge of the Empire it­ self: outliers where people run to escape Imperial agents, where rebels plot and strike against the Imperial military, and where the explorers and colonists establish new lives. Living here is a gamble: a loss of societal law and pro­ tections also brings freedom from Imperial interference and repression. Naturally, the fringes are home to crimi­ nals. scoundrels, and outlaws. Given that Imperial rules regularly outlaw dissent and resistance, it isn't hard for otherwise honest and upstanding citizens to run afoul of Imperial edicts—and find themselves on the run. Life at the edge requires hard work and risk-taking just to survive. People are often caught in events beyond their control—Imperial security sweeps, mistaken identities, con games, fraud, accusations of rebel sympathy, theft, and more. The adventurous can turn their misfortunes into new opportunities for freedom, credits, and even starships. They learn the ways of the edge, and thrive de­ spite its challenges. Some even manipulate the situation to their own advantage while maintaining their own moral code. Life is a dangerous adventure. in the galaxy. The Empire relentlessly seeks out rebels and their sympathizers, pursuing the main rebel leader­ ship across the galaxy. A fter the destruction of the Death Star, to be labeled a rebel is to be a hated and hunted enemy of the Empire. BEW ARE TH E POW ERFUL HUTTS The Hutts are immense, slug-like creatures who wield great influence in the galaxy; they have done so since the ancient days of the Republic. They nominally fall un­ der the control of the Empire, but the Hutts long usurped Imperial power in H utt Space through corrupt and mon­ etary means. Many, like the legendary Jabba the Hutt, are criminal overlords, with the type of power and un­ derworld connections that make them difficult for the Empire to counter effectively or eliminate completely. The Hutts' efforts—criminal or otherwise—heavily influ­ ence the economies, governments, and illegal activities in large areas of the sprawling O uter Rim Territories. It’s hard to operate at the fringes of society w ithout encoun­ tering a H utt scheme. Worse, failing or crossing a Hutt tends to be expensive (and occasionally violent). Bounty hunters make a good living enforcing H utt revenge. THE H ID D EN BLACK SUN Black Sun is a secret interstellar crime syndicate, op­ erating at every level of galactic society. Powerful crime lords called Vigos protect Black Sun’s underworld su­ premacy while simultaneously vying for more power and territory within the organization. Each Vigo organizes, coordinates, and controls massive illegal operations in his own region in the galaxy. Secrecy is paramount to Black Sun’s centuries-long operations. Smaller criminal groups often unknowingly work for the sprawling crime syndicate. Black Sun is sometimes an ally (but more of­ ten an adversary) of the Imperial government.

PLAYING THE GAME T he Edge of the Empire Roleplaying Game focuses on the grim and gritty portions of the Star Wars uni­ verse. Characters exist in places where morality is gray and nothing is certain, highlighting those who live on the fringes of both the galaxy and its society. In an Edge of the Empire campaign, bounty hunters,-smugglers, mercenaries, and explorers not only rub elbows with doctors, politicians, and scholars, but also find them­ selves thrust into adventures together with them. During these adventures, the characters will often find themselves facing any number of challenges, from repairing their damaged starship or slicing their way past a security panel to exchanging blaster fire with hired guns out to collect a bounty. The characters must rely on their innate abilities, trained skills, and special talents to survive. This chapter provides a broad overview of the ba­ sics of Edge of the Em pire. First, the section discusses what a roleplaying game is and what players need when preparing to play this game. The section then explores the various elements of the game’s core me­ chanic and special dice, The section continues with "Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view." • -O b i-W a n K enobi additional rules that govern the core of Edce of the Empire’s gameplay. The section ends with a discussion of the general makeup of characters found in Edge of the Empire Overall, this chapter covers the.core rules of Edge of the Em pir e, and other chapters cover rules dealing with specific situations in the game. WHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME? A roleplaying game is a collaborative storytelling game. Each player takes on the role of a character in a fic­ tional universe—in this case, Star Wars. Players work together to tell a story in which those characters work together to overcome challenges, do battle with dan­ gerous enemies, and even make a profit doing so. Cus­ tom dice are used to add an element of randomness to the game, so the outcome of the story isn’t known beforehand. Each character has unique characteristics and rules dictating his strengths and weaknesses. He follows rules for developing as the game progresses and uses the custom dice to determine his chances of success or failure at any given task. N ew to roleplaying games? One easy way to learn how to play role- playing games (and Edge of the Empire specifically) is to play through the Edge of the Empire B eginner Ga m e. This product teach­ es roleplaying to new play­ ers over the course of an adventure and contains everything a group needs to get started. BEGINNER GAME in the Star Wars universe—tough, savvy, resourceful, and powerful people who are destined to make an impact on the galaxy. However, the PCs are also distinct from the common masses. In general, the PCs have special qualities or abilities that set them apart and make them unique. PCs are generally well trained in their field, highly capable, and often have ac- ess to a variety of resources. This distinction is what allows the PCs to face the dangers that abound in an Edge of the Em pire campaign. THE BASICS: WHAT PLAYERS NEED TO PLAY Beginning an Edge of the Empire game requires very few materials. Besides at least one copy of this rule­ book, players will need pencils or pens and copies of the character sheets found on page 444 to record information about their characters. The group will also need access to one or more standard 10-sided dice. Two dice per player is recommended. The players and Came Master (CM) should use the special custom dice designed specifically to manage the unique task resolution system used in the game. The dice are described in detail later in this chapter, and can be obtained through several venues. • Packs of dice are available for purchase at local hobby game retailers or can be ordered online from Fantasy Flight Carnes. • Each Edge of the Empire B eginner G a m e comes with a set of dice. • Fantasy Flight Games offers a Star Wars™ Dice app for iOS and Android devices. Flowever, if these dice are not available, a chart on page 1 2 shows how players can use standard six- sided, eight-sided, and twelve-sided dice, which are readily found at most hobby game retailers. THE PLAYER CHARACTERS (THE PCS) In Edge of the Empire, each player creates his own unique character. It is this character that will embark on adventures and become one of the protagonists of the story, alongside the other players’ characters. Col­ lectively, these characters are called Player Characters, or "PCs” for short. These Player Characters are cut from the same cloth as other memorable characters found THE GAME MASTER (THE GM) The Came Master (often abbreviated as "CM”) is the player who sets the scenes, advances the storyline, and adjudicates the rules in an Edce of the Empire game. The GM also controls the vast cast of charac­ ters known as Non-Player Characters (NPCs). Every­ one the Player Characters meet and interact with, from a common junk yard vendor to a high-ranking public official, is managed by the GM. Ultimately, the GM provides the backdrop and framework for the ad­ venture, adding details as events unfold and the PCs make decisions that impact the story. The CM is not the PCs’ adversary or playing "against” the other players. Rather, the GM is a guide and resource to help explain the "who, what, where, and why” of the people, places, and events the PCs encounter. Ideally, the CM works with the other players to develop and resolve the story. While it is true that the CM sets the charac­ ters up to fight against opponents and may place them in dangerous situations, the goal is for the CM to provide interesting encounters, keep the players motivated, and help the story flow as smoothly as possible. Remember, since Edge of the Empire relies on narra­ tive and interpretive game play, all of the players work together to evaluate results and describe how the story unfolds. The CM just has the additional responsibilities of managing the NPCs, helping resolve disputes, and establishing how the game rules will be applied. Ulti­ mately, the CM’s word is final. If the CM makes a ruling, the other players should accept it and keep the story moving. More about playing as the Game Master can be found in Chapter IX: The Game Master NARRATIVE PLAY Edge of the Empire asks the players to step into their characters’ roles and use dramatic narrative to de­ scribe events and advance the story. While this rule­ book provides specific rules on how to resolve actions, the game relies heavily on both the Game Master and the players to use their imagination—tempered with common sense—to explain what happens. In Edge of the Empire, combat, placement of charac­ ters, and other situations are represented in an abstract fashion. This level of abstraction allows the game to keep the focus on the characters and their actions, rather than measurements, statistics, or minutiae. Rather than taking a ruler and measuring the distance between char­ acters on a map, it is preferable for a player to simply state: "I’m ducking behind the computer console to get some cover while I return fire.” That sort of description paints a much better picture of the action taking place. Resolving actions also has a narrative element Edge of the Empire utilizes a unique system of dice to de­ determine if a given task succeeds or fails. However, the dice provide far more than a simple pass/fail result. The combination of dice types and symbols are all resources the players can use to help tell the story and add depth to the scene. The variety of results allows for interesting and compelling encounters. It is possible for a character to fail at a task, but still receive some benefit or find a brief respite. Likewise, a character may succeed at a task but at a certain cost, or with unforeseen complications. THE CORE MECHANIC T he core mechanic of the game revolves around the skill check. The skill check determines whether specif­ ic actions performed by characters succeed or fail, and any consequences that may accompany that success or failure. This core mechanic in Edge of the Empire is quite simple, and can be broken into two key elements: 1. Roll a pool of dice. 2. After all factors have been accounted for, if there is at least one Success symbol, the task succeeds. The first element involves rolling a pool of dice. When a character wishes to attempt an action, a dice pool must be assembled. The number and type of dice are influenced by several factors, such as the character’s innate abilities, skill training, equipment, and the inher- POSITIVE DICE AND NEGATIVE DICE E ach dice pool is made up of a number of dice from several different sources. Essentially, these dice pools are composed of "positive dice” and "negative dice.” Positive dice are added to the pool to help ac­ complish a task or achieve beneficial side effects. These may reflect an innate talent or ability, spe- TABLE 1-1: POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DICE cial training, superior resources, or other advan­ tages applied to the specific task. Negative dice are added to the pool to hinder or disrupt a task, or to introduce the possibility of complicating side effects. These may reflect the inherent difficulty of the task, obstacles, additional risks, or the efforts of another character to thwart the task. Positive Dice Come From Negative Dice Come From The skill used to accomplish a task The difficulty of the task attempted The characteristic being applied An opponent's special abilities, skills, or characteristics An applicable talent or special ability Opposing forces at work Equipment or gear being used by the character Inclement weather or environmental effects The use of light side Destiny Points The use of dark side Destiny Points Tactical or situational advantages Tactical or situational disadvantages Other advantages, as determined by the GM Other disadvantages, as determined by the GM ent difficulty of the task being attempted. The GM may decide that the environment or the situation warrants certain dice, as well—repairing a starship with ample time and the proper tools is one thing, but attempting repairs in the pouring rain, without tools, while under a hail of blaster fire is quite different. Once all the neces­ sary dice have been assembled, the player attempting the task rolls all of the dice in his pool. The second element involves interpreting the results on the dice. The players look at the symbols on the face­ up sides of each die. Certain symbols work in pairs, one type canceling out another. Other symbols are not can­ celed, and their effects are applied regardless of the out­ come of the task. After comparing the first set of paired THE DICE T his section takes a closer look at the special dice and their symbols. By understanding these dice and sym­ bols, players will have a better understanding of the core mechanic. This section also discusses how to as­ semble a dice pool, and when to introduce extra dice based on the circumstances. Remember, these dice may be purchased separately, or players may use the Star Wars Dice app to roll them electronically. When a character makes a skill check in Edge of the Empire, the dice allow the players to quickly determine success and failure, as well as magnitude and narrative implications. To accomplish this, Edge of the Empire uses seven types of dice. Each die has a specific function and purpose. The dice differ significantly. Each die face will either be blank or will feature one or more symbols that represent various positive or negative effects. A typical dice pool generally ranges from five to eight dice. This pool size covers the majority of situations. Difficult, complex, or epic situations may include more dice, while mundane situations may involve fewer dice. Dice pools are generally not assembled or rolled for tasks so trivial that success is guaranteed. The impact of generating and rolling a dice pool is best used with important tasks that can influence the story. Dice can be divided into three categories. The first type features dice which possess symbols beneficial to success and accomplishing tasks. The second type comprises dice which possess symbols that cancel those beneficial symbols and hinder the accomplish­ meant of tasks. The third type of dice are Force dice, which are used slightly differently than the other dice. Boost, Ability, and Proficiency dice are the beneficial, positive dice. Setback, Difficulty, and Challenge dice are the negative, disruptive dice. Force dice are distinct, and while used for a number of situations, Force dice are generally not used in a standard skill check. symbols—Success and Failure—the players can deter­ mine if the task succeeds. Then they compare the sec­ one set of symbols—Advantage and Threat—to deter­ mine if there are any beneficial side effects or negative consequences. Finally, any other symbols are resolved to add the last details to the outcome. This core mechanic, the skill check, forms the foundation of the game. Other rules and effects ei­ ther modify or interact with one of these two fun­ damental elements—the pool of dice being assembled or the results on the dice after they are rolled. POSITIVE DICE There are three types of positive dice which provide symbols that improve the odds of successfully com­ pleting a task or achieving beneficial side effects. BOOST DICE □ Special advantages, or “boosts," are represented with light blue six-sided dice. Boost dice represent benefits gained through luck, chance, and ad­ vantageous actions taken by the charac­ ters. They can be added to a pool for a wide variety of reasons. Boost dice are most often used to reflect the character gaining some sort of benefit or advantage, such as having ample time to complete the task or having the right equipment. Boost dice and Setback dice are thematic opposites of each other. Boost dice are represented by □ in text. ABILITY DICE <> Ability is represented with green eight­ sided dice. Ability dice form the basis of most dice pools rolled by the players. They represent the character’s aptitude or skill used when attempting a skill check. These dice possess positive, beneficial symbols. Ability dice are opposed by Difficulty dice. Ability dice are repre­ sented by {> n text. PROFICIENCY DICE O Proficiency is represented with yellow twelve-sided dice. Proficiency dice rep­ resent the combination of innate abil­ ity and training. They are most often used when a character is attempting a skill check using a skill in which he has trained. Proficiency dice can also be added to a pool by investing a Des­ tiny Point into an important skill check. These dice possess a greater likelihood of success, and are the only dice that feature the potent Triumph symbol (see page 23). Proficiency dice are the upgraded ver­ sion of Ability dice (for more on upgrades, see page 21). Proficiency dice are represented by O in text. NEGATIVE DICE There are three types of negative dice which impose symbols that undermine success or introduce un­ wanted complications. SETBACK DICE ■ Certain complications, or “setbacks,” are represented with black six-sided dice. Setback dice represent problems or minor obstacles during task resolu­ tion. Setback dice are often used to represent rela­ tively minor effects that impair or hinder a character, such as poor lighting, obstructive terrain, insufficient resources, or facing a hungry rancor instead of an old decrepit one. Setback dice are not as potent as Dif­ ficulty dice, and are added to represent additional circumstances and environmental effects that would not in and of themselves increase the base difficulty of the task. Setback dice and Boost dice are thematic opposites of each other. Setback dice are represent­ ed by ■ in text. DIFFICULTY DICE 4 Difficulty is represented with purple eight-sided dice. Difficulty dice repre­ sent the inherent challenge or complex­ ity of a particular task a character is attempting. In simplest terms, the more Difficulty dice in a dice pool, the more challenging it is to succeed. Difficulty dice possess negative, harmful symbols that cancel out the positive, beneficial symbols found on Ability, Boost, and Proficiency dice. Difficulty dice oppose Ability dice. Difficulty dice are represented by 4 in text. CHALLENGE DICE # Challenge is represented with red twelve-sided dice. Challenge dice rep­ resent the most extreme adversity and opposition. These dice may be featured in place of Difficulty dice during particularly daunting challenges posed by trained, elite, or pre­ pared opponents. Challenge dice can also be added to a pool by investing a Destiny Point into an important skill check. These dice feature primarily negative, ob­ structive results, such as Threats and Failures, but the Challenge dice also feature the potent Despair result (see page 24). Challenge dice are the upgraded ver­ sion of Difficulty dice (for more on upgrades, see page 21). Challenge dice are represented by # in text. FORCE DICE The Force is abstracted using white twelve-sided dice. These Force dice represent the power and pervasive­ ness of the Force, and are generally only used in dice pools by characters (or creatures) with Force Sensitivity, or under special circumstances. One of these special cases is when the players gener­ ate their starting Destiny pool at the beginning of a session (see Destiny Points, page 27). Unlike the other dice used for task resolution which generate results that impact success and failure or magnitude and complication, the Force dice generate resources. Each die features both dark side and light side points. There are no blank sides on a Force die. When players roll Force dice, they always generate a number of resources—but the resources may be dark side, light side, or a mix of both. Force dice are represented by O in text. See Chap­ ter VIII: The Force for more on using Force dice. TEN-SIDED DICE In addition to the custom dice de­ scribed above, the game also uses standard ten-sided dice. These dice are abbreviated as “d 10" when rolled by themselves. Many standard dIOs feature a “zero” on one side. If this side is rolled, it is counted as “ 10.” This allows the d 10 to generate any number between 1 and 10. In Edge of the Empire, a more common roll using d 10s is called the percentile roll. When making a percentile roll, the player rolls two dice, designating one die as the tens digit, and the other die as the ones digit. A result of zero on either die is counted as a zero. A result of “00” on both dice indicates a roll of 100. The percentile roll is abbreviated as d 100, and is used most often as a ran­ domizer, generating a number between 1 and 100. Per­ centile rolls are used to generate numbers to find results on lookup tables, such as the severity of a critical injury effect, or to determine whether or not a character's out­ standing Obligations come into play (see page 41). EXAMPLE David’s character inflicts a critical injury on a feral gundark. David rolls percentiles to de­ determine how severe the critical injury is. Fie chooses one green d 10 and one blue d10. Fie designates the green die as the tens digit. After rolling the dice, the green die shows a 4 and the blue die a 7. The percentile roll is read as 47. If the green die showed a zero instead, the percentile roll would be read as 7 (zero-seven). CONVERTING STANDARD DICE TO TASK DICE ■ ■hen playing Edge of the Empire, the CM and W p la y e rs ideally have access to a full comple­ meant of the special dice described here. However, there may be times when the dice are not avail­ able. This should not stop the game from continu­ ing. Players may use several standard 6-sided, 8-sided, and 1 2-sided dice to generate the results found on the custom dice by using the chart be­ low. Players simply convert the numerical results generated to symbols used in the game.

Understanding these symbols allows the players to more fully contribute to the story, generating memorable details and de­ scribing cinematic actions over the course of their adventures. This section introduces and defines the different symbols, as well as describes how they may be used in play. Just like dice, symbols can broadly be classified into several categories. The three types of symbols are positive results, negative results, and Force resources. POSITIVE RESULTS There are three positive symbols found on the task resolution dice. These results are Success, Advantage, and Triumph. SUCCESS # Success symbols # are critical for determining whether a skill check succeeds or fails. Success is undermined by Failure. Mechanically, one Success symbol & is canceled by one Failure symbol T . Based on the core mechanic, if there is at least one Success remaining in the pool after all can­ cellations, the skill check succeeds. In Edge of the Em p ir e, Success symbols # can also influence the magnitude of the outcome. For example, in combat, each Success is added to the damage inflicted to the target. Generating four net Successes would in­ flict four additional damage. Success symbols appear on <$>, Q and O dice. ADVANTAGE O The Advantage symbol O indicates an opportunity for a positive consequence or side effect, regard­ less of the task’s success or failure. Some examples of these positive side effects could include slicing a computer in far less time than anticipated, finding an opening during a firefight to duck back into cover, or recovering from strain during a stressful situation. It is possible for a task to fail while generating a number of Advantages, allowing something good to come out of the failure. Likewise, Advantages can oc­ cur alongside success, allowing for some significantly positive outcomes. It is important to remember that Advantage symbols do not directly impact success or failure, only the magnitude or potential side effects. Advantage is canceled by Threat. Each Threat symbol <§> cancels one Advantage symbol O Characters may use Advantage results in a wide va­ riety of ways—this is known as "taking the Advantage.” If a skill check generates one or more net Advantage symbols O the player can spend that Advantage to apply one or more special side effects. This could include triggering a critical hit, activating a weapon's special quality, recovering strain, or even performing additional maneuvers. The applications of Advantage are covered in more detail on page 205. Advantage symbols appear on <(>. Q and O dice. TR IU M P H $ The Triumph symbol ^ is a powerful result, indicat­ ing a significant boon or beneficial outcome. Each Tri­ umph symbol provides two effects: First, each Triumph symbol also counts as one Success, in every means previously defined as a Suc­ cess. This means the Success portion of a Triumph symbol ($) could potentially be canceled by Failure symbols generated during the same skill check. Secondly, each Triumph symbol can be used to trigger incredibly potent effects. Two common uses are to use a ($i to automatically trigger a critical injury with a successful attack, or to activate a weapon's special quality—effects that usually require multiple Advan­ tage symbols O to activate. Triumphs may activate other potent effects as well, including effects above and beyond those triggered by Advantage. These ef­ fects may be set by the CM, or they may defined by the environment, a piece of equipment, or a special character ability. See page 205 for more information on using the Triumph symbol ($) to trigger effects. Players gain both effects with each Triumph symbol; they do not have to choose be­ tween the Success or the special effect trigger. As a Success, that aspect of the Triumph symbol (£> can be canceled by a Failure symbol ▼ as usual; how­ ever, the second as­ pect of the 0 result cannot be canceled Multiple Triumphs are cum ulative- each Triumph adds one Success, and each can be used to generate its own special effect. The Triumph sym­ bol only appears on the O die. NEGATIVE RESULTS There are three negative symbols found on the task resolution dice. These results are Failure, Threat, and Despair. FAILURE T Failure symbols T are critical for determining whether a skill check succeeds or fails. Failure un­ determines Success. Mechanically, one Failure symbol T cancels one Success symbol Based on the core mechanic, if there is at least one Success symbol # re­ maining in the pool after all cancellations, the skill check succeeds. Fortunately for characters, multiple net Failure symbols T do not influence the magnitude of the failure. Failure symbols appear on ■ , and # dice. THREAT ® The Threat symbol ® is fuel for negative conse­ quences or side effects, regardless of the task’s suc­ cess or failure. Some examples of these negative side effects could include taking far longer than expected to slice a computer terminal, leaving an opening dur­ ing a firefight which allows an enemy to duck into cover, or suffering additional strain during a stressful situation. It is possible for a task to suc­ ceed while generating a number of Threats, taint­ ing or diminishing the impact of the success. Likewise, Threats can occur alongside Failure, creating the possibility for some significantly dire outcomes. It is important to remem­ ber that Threat sym­ bols <§> do not directly impact success or fail­ ure, only the magnitude or potential side effects. Threat cancels Advantage. Each Threat symbol <§> cancels one Advantage symbol O The CM gener­ ally resolves Threat effects. There are a wide variety of possible effects that Threat may trigger. If a skill check gener­ ates one or more net Threat symbols, the CM generally applies one or more special side ef­ fects. This could include being knocked prone, los­ ing the advantage of cover, taking more tim e than an­ ticipated, suffering strain during a normally routine action, or potentially al­ lowing an enemy to per­ form a maneuver. The applications of Threat are covered in more detail on page 205. Threat symbols appear on ■ . 4 and # dice. DESPAIR ^ The Despair symbol ^ is a powerful result, indicate­ ing a significant bane or detrimental outcome. Each Despair symbol imposes two effects: First, each Despair symbol & also counts as one Failure T , in every means previously defined as a Failure. This means the Failure portion of a Despair symbol could potentially be canceled by Success symbols & generated during the same skill check. Secondly, each Despair can be used to trigger potent negative effects. A Despair symbol ^ may be used to in­ dicate a weapon has jammed, or run out of ammunition or energy cells. Despair may activate other potent ef­ fects as well, including effects above and beyond those triggered by Threats. These effects may be set by the CM, or defined by the environment, an adversary, or a special character ability. See page 205 for more info­ mation on using a Despair symbol ^ to trigger effects. Players suffer both effects with each Despair symbol; they do not get to choose between the Failure or the special effect trigger. As a Failure, that aspect of the De­ spair symbol can be canceled by a Success symbol & as usual, however the second aspect of the Despair symbol ^ result cannot be canceled. Multiple Despair symbols ^ are cumulative—each Despair imposes one Failure, and each can be used to generate its own special effect. The Despair symbol only appears on the # die. FORCE RESOURCES The final category of dice symbols represents resources generated by the Force dice. There are two types of re­ sources: light side Force points O and dark side Force points # . Force-sensitive characters can use these re­ sources to help fuel special abilities, such as telekinesis or precognitive combat awareness. Powerful Force users like Jedi use Force dice frequently, and struggle with the balance of the light and dark sides of the Force. In Edce of the Empire, such powerful Force users are generally quite rare. While Player Characters have the potential to be Force-sensitive and gain some fledg­ ling control of the Force, there are other uses for the Force dice besides using Force powers. One of the most common applications of the Force dice in Edge of the Empire is their use to determine the group’s starting pool of Destiny Points at the beginning of each session (see page 27). Unlike the positive and negative dice used for task resolution, Force dice generate resources which are spent to fuel a power's effects, such as magnitude, range, or duration. The Force die and the mechan­ ics that govern it are very different from the core skill check mechanics of Edge of the Em pire, and are dis­ cussed in greater detail in Chapter VIII: The Force LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION! D uring the course of an Edge of the Empire adven­ true, characters find themselves attempting a va­ riety of tasks. These tasks may help resolve interac­ tions between PCs and NPCs, keep the story moving along, or conduct a fierce firefight between the PCs and enemy mercenaries. When the outcome of a PCs task is uncertain, that character will usually need to perform a skill check to determine success or failure of a particular action. These skill checks often utilize a number of different character attributes, such as skill, special talents, and inherent ability. The type of skill check required is determined by the CM. Once the type of check and its difficulty have been set, the player creates a pool of dice based on the different factors involved. This can be a combina­ tion of many types of dice, and often varies based on the characters involved and the specific situation. After the dice pool has been created, the player rolls all of the dice assembled. The results on these dice are evaluated. Some results cancel each other out, others are cumulative. Once all evaluations have been made, the player and GM can resolve the skill check by determining the action’s success or failure. They use the information they obtain from the dice results to describe the outcome of the check as well as any additional effects, com pli­ cations, or surprises. THE BASIC DICE POOL E dge of the Empire utilizes a concept known as a dice pool, which is a collection of the custom dice needed for the game (see The Dice on page 10). While some advanced or complex actions may re­ quire a large dice pool, the basic dice pool is quite simple. The basic dice pool relies on three factors: the PC’s inherent ability, any specialized training, and the difficulty of the task being attempted. Following a look at these three factors in greater de­ tail, this section goes on to describe assembling and resolving a basic dice pool, as well as discusses some additional types of dice pools and checks players may use during'a game session. CHARACTERISTICS In Edge of the Em pir e, a character’s intrinsic abilities are defined by six characteristics: Brawn, Agility, Intel­ lect, Cunning, Willpower, and Presence. Brawn and Agility are a measure of the charac­ ter’s physical abilities, his strength, flexibility, athletic prowess, skill with weapons, and general toughness. Intellect and Cunning are the character’s mental abili­ ties, reflecting his knowledge, analytical skill, clever­ ness, and deductive reasoning. Willpower and Pres­ ence represent the character’s personality and force of spirit, such as his charisma, mental fortitude, and how well he relates to and interacts with others. A character’s species determines his starting char­ acteristic ratings. However, each player has the op­ portunity to increase these default characteristics during character creation by investing a portion of his starting experience points. It is im portant to note that after character creation, increasing characteris­ tics is a significant in-game investment—something that may only happen a few times over the course of an entire campaign Players need to think care­ fully about their characteristic ratings, and should consider investing a significant portion of their starting experience points in improving their characteristics (more on character creation is covered on page 33). Although it does make sense to focus on characteris­ tics that help the character’s core skills and talents (such as a Politico character with high Presence or a Soldier with a high Brawn rating), the game system offers a great deal of flexibility. Players should consider going against the stereotypes or possibly plan ahead in anticipation of moving into other careers over the course of a cam­ paign. For example, the player may decide that his Pilot character is big and hulking, increasing the character’s Brawn, thinking he might eventually become a Hired Cun or Bounty Hunter. Likewise, a Slicer with a high Agil­ ity rating could be just as nimble with his body as he is with computers, opening up the opportunity to perhaps one day become a Thief or infiltration specialist. CHARACTERISTIC RATINGS Characteristic ratings for both PCs and NPCs gener­ ally range from one to six. Some exceptions exist, es­ pecially in powerful or unique cases—for example, a rancor likely has a Brawn rating much higher than one of the PCs. NPCs like Darth Vader, Yoda, Han Solo, and other exceptional individuals from the Star Wars universe likely have abilities well beyond the scope of your typical starting NPC. A typical humanoid has an average characteristic rating of 2. A rating of 1 is weak and below average. A characteristic rating of 3 or 4 is significantly above average, while ratings of 5 or 6 represent exceptional performance and ability. During character creation, no characteristic can be higher than five. Once play begins, PC characteristics are capped at six. Each species has a default characteristic profile, reflecting that species' particular strengths and weaknesses. This profile is then augmented and improved during creation by investing experience points. To find the default characteristic profiles of each playable species, see Chapter II: Character Cre­ ation The six characteristics are defined below. AGILITY The Agility characteristic measures a character’s man­ ual dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and body con- trol. Characters with a high Agility have a good sense of balance, flexibility, and deft hands. Agility is used for a number of physical skills such as Coordination, and is key to ranged combat skills such as Ranged (Light) and Ranged (Heavy). BRAWN A character’s Brawn represents a blend of a charac­ ter's brute power, strength, and overall toughness, as well as the ability to apply those attributes as need­ ed. Characters with a high Brawn are physically fit and hardy, tend not to get sick often, and have strong constitutions. Brawn is used for a number of physical skills such as Athletics and Brawl. Brawn is also used to determine a character’s starting wound threshold. CUNNING Cunning reflects how crafty, devious, clever, and cre­ ative a character can be. Characters with a high Cunning are savvy, quickly pick up on social and environmental clues, and can more readily come up with short-term plans and tactics. Cunning is used for a number of men­ tal skills, such as Deception, Perception, and Survival. INTELLECT The Intellect characteristic measures a character’s intelligence, education, mental acuity, and ability to reason and rationalize. Charac­ ters with a high Intel­ lect can extrapolate or interpolate data, can recall details and draw from previous ex­ perience, and can think of long-term strategies and envision the rami­ fications of present ac­ tions. Intellect is used fora number of men­ tal skills, such as Astrogation, Com­ puters, and all the Knowledge skills, such as Lore and Xenology. PRESENCE A character’s Presence characteristic is a measure of his moxie, charisma, confidence, and force of person­ ality. Characters with a high Presence make natural leaders, draw attention when they enter a room, can easily strike up a conversation with nearly anyone, and are quick to adapt to social situations. Presence is the key characteristic for interpersonal skills such as Charm and Leadership. WILLPOWER The Willpower characteristic reflects a character’s dis­ cipline, self-control, mental fortitude, and faith. Char­ acters with a high Willpower can withstand stress and fatigue, remain composed during chaotic situations, and exert influence over the weaker-willed. Willpower is used for a number of skills, such as Coercion and Vigilance. Willpower is also used to determine a char­ acter's starting strain threshold. CHARACTERISTICS IN PLAY Different careers and professions rely on different characteristics more than others. Characteristics also influence skills, a wide variety of character abilities, and some derived statistics. For example, in addi­ tion to being used for Athletics and Melee combat skill checks, Brawn is used to determine a character’s starting wound threshold and forms the basis of a character’s soak value. As mentioned previously, characteristics are one of the three determining factors when a player creates a dice pool to perform a check (the other factors being skill training and task difficulty). See page 15 for more information about dice pools. SKILLS & TRAINING While characteristics are extremely important and create the foundation of a character’s abilities, skills and specialized training are also key components of a character’s makeup. Skills represent the character’s training or experience in performing specific tasks and actions. Although a character can attem pt almost anything without the proper training or skill, he will be far more effective and capable if he is skilled at performing the task at hand. Skills represent specific training, hands-on experi­ ence, or focused knowledge in a certain area. Each skill is linked to a specific characteristic, the default ability a character uses when performing a task with that skill. For example, the Athletics skill is based on Brawn, Deception relies on Cunning, and Lore uses In­ tellect. The proper skill training can compensate for a low characteristic rating. However, the most proficient characters are those who have both the proper train­ ing and a strong linked characteristic. TABLE 1-3: DIFFICULTY LEVELS Difficulty Level Dice Example Simple - Routine, with the outcome rarely in question Usually not rolled unless the GM wishes to know the possible magnitude of success, or Setback dice indicate the possibility of complications. Easy ♦ Picking a primitive lock, tending to minor cuts and bruises, finding food and shelter on a lush planet, shooting a target at close range. Average ♦ ♦ Picking a typical lock, stitching up a small wound, finding food and shelter on a temperate planet, shooting a target at medium range or trying to strike a target while engaged. Hard ♦ ♦ ♦ Picking a complicated lock, setting broken bones or suturing large wounds, finding food and shelter on a rugged planet, shooting at a target at long range. Daunting ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ Picking an exceptionally sophisticated lock, performing surgery or grafting implants, finding food and shelter on a barren desert planet, shooting at a target at extreme range. Formidable 44444 Picking a lock with no comprehensible mechanism, cloning a new body, finding food and shelter on a planet without breathable atmosphere. A character’s career choice provides career shills. Characters start out with training, or “ ranks,” in some of their career skills. Over the course of a campaign, a character can learn and improve any skills he choose­ es; however, improving career skills costs fewer expe­ rience points than skills outside his current career. For a more in-depth look at skills and their applica­ tion, see Chapter III: Skills DIFFICULTY The third factor in defining a dice pool (in addition to a characteristic and related skill) is the difficulty of the task being attempted. The characteristic and skill ranks add positive dice to the dice pool. Difficulty adds nega­ tive dice, which make success more challenging. In ad­ dition to the task’s inherent difficulty, other dice may be added to reflect additional complications based on the environment or specific situation. While the characteristic and related skill training are defined by the character attem pting the task, the difficulty of a task is set by the GM. There are six basic difficulty levels (see the Impossible Tasks sidebar on page 18 for an optional seventh dif­ ficulty level). Some modifiers or situations may war­ rant checks higher than Formidable, based on the GM’s discretion. In addition to providing a general classification which describes a task’s inherent challenge, the dif­ ficulty level also indicates how many purple Difficulty dice are added to the dice pool when attempting that particular task. A task performed against a set diffi­ culty level is referred to as a standard check. DEFINING TASK DIFFICULTY When used to describe the difficulty of checks or tasks, difficulty levels are represented using one of the defined difficulty labels, followed by the number of Difficulty dice added to the dice pool in parenthe­ ses. For example, a player might face an Easy (4) Perception check or a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Mechanics check. More detailed examples of each difficulty level are provided here to give players a clear idea of what the different levels represent. SIMPLE TASKS ( - ) A simple task is something so basic and routine that the outcome is rarely in doubt. Success is assumed for the majority of simple tasks. If failure is virtu­ ally impossible, the task should not even require a check—the GM may simply state the proposed action succeeds. If circumstances make the outcome uncer­ tain, then a simple task may require a roll. This is gen­ erally only the case if one or more Setback dice are introduced, such as Setback dice added from injuries, the environment, or opposition. A simple task adds no Difficulty dice to the skill check’s dice pool. EASY TASKS (4 ) An easy task represents something that should pose little challenge to most characters, but something could go wrong and failure is still possible. A typical character with the proper training, resources, and the right tools for the situation should reasonably expect to succeed at most easy tasks he attempts. Often, the magnitude or potential side effects are more uncer­ tain than the success itself. An easy task adds one Difficulty die ( 4 to the skill check’s dice pool. AVERAGE TASKS ( 4 ♦ ) An average task represents a routine action where success is common enough to be expected, but failure is not surprising. A typical character with the proper training, resources, and the right approach to the situ­ ation should reasonably expect to succeed at average tasks slightly more often than he fails. An average task adds two Difficulty dice ( ^ to the skill check’s dice pool. HARD TASKS ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) A hard task is much more demanding of a character. Success is certainly feasible, but failure is far from sur­ prising. A typical character with the proper training, resources, and the right tools for the situation should accept that he might fail at hard tasks more often than he succeeds—especially without Destiny on his side or other advantages. A hard task adds three Difficulty dice ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) to the skill check’s dice pool. DAUNTING TASKS ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) A daunting task taxes a character and may push him to his limits. Success may be difficult to achieve, but it is possible. A typical character with the proper train­ ing, resources, and the right tools for the situation will likely fail more often than he succeeds at daunting tasks, and he may wish to look for some advantages to aid him. A daunting task adds four Difficulty dice ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) to the skill check’s dice pool. FORMIDABLE TASKS ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Formidable tasks seem nigh impossible. In fact, a for­ midable task most likely is impossible if approached casually. However, with proper planning, a well-trained IMPOSSIBLE TASKS T here are some situations in which the chance of success is impossibly low. In almost all cases, the CM simply states that any such check automatically fails without needing to assemble and roll a pool of dice. However, the CM may decide to allow a PC to attem pt a check where success is extremely improbable—throwing a grenade in hopes that it will put out a fire, scaling a perfectly smooth, slick wall, or using reason to calm down a ram­ paging rancor, for example. Allowing the PCs to make an impossible task should be relegated to critical moments in a story’s arc or truly life- or-death situations only. To prevent players from abusing these opportuni­ ties, attempting an impossible task automatically requires the player to spend one Destiny point. The player gains no benefits for doing so, beyond being able to attempt the task in the first place. He also may not spend any additional Destiny Points on the check. For simplicity, an impossible task imposes the same number of Difficulty dice as a formidable task (O O C ’C ’ O)- and well-equipped character has a chance at success. Typical characters almost always fail formidable tasks. Even trained veterans fail formidable tasks more often then they succeed. Failure seems inevitable unless the character can apply one or more advantages, such as investing Destiny points, or adding bonuses from spe­ cific equipment, talents, or assistance. A formidable task adds five Difficulty dice ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) to the skill check’s dice pool. BUILDING A BASIC DICE POOL N ow that the three primary building blocks of a skill check’s dice pool have been discussed, the following section shows how the dice pool is actually assembled. When a character wants to attempt some sort of action that might have a chance of failure, the player makes a skill check. The skill check utilizes the ap­ propriate skill of the character—Athletics for breaking down doors, Knowledge for recalling facts, or Charm for convincing a guard to let the character get past, for example. Each skill also has a linked characteris­ tic—Brawn for Athletics, Intellect for Knowledge, and Presence for Charm. To make a skill check, he assem­ bles a dice pool. There are two sides to every basic dice pool—the side the player contributes (in the form of Ability dice <)> and Proficiency dice O) and the side the CM con­ tributes (in the form of Difficulty dice Challenge d ic e # , Boost d ic e Q and Setback dice■ ] . Addition­ al factors may modify the number and type of dice for a check. When building a dice pool, every aspect of both the player’s and CM ’s contributing dice should be explained and defined before the roll is made. The CM sets the difficulty level of the task once prior to the roll. After creating the base dice pool, either side may have the opportunity to upgrade dice. E X AM PLE 3: LO W H H R IC K Finally, Lowhhrick the surly Wookiee hired gun tries to get past the same security terminal. The Wookiee has Intellect 2 but no ranks of train­ ing in Computers. His Intellect is higher, so the player begins by adding two A bility dice ( ♦ ♦ ) to his pool. Since he has no ranks in Computers, th a t value is considered zero and no A bility dice are upgraded to Proficiency dice. To attem pt this action, Lowhhrick starts out with only two dice in his dice pool: ♦ ♦ (two A bility dice). Note that both 41-VEX and Oskara begin with the same size and type of dice pool, despite the fact their ranks in the Computers skill and Intel­ lect ratings are different. The system allows a character to compensate for a lack of innate abil­ ity by improving his trained skills, and vice versa. APPLYING SKILLS & CHARACTERISTICS The active character’s skill training and the skill’s as­ sociated characteristic are equally important when building a dice pool. When performing a task, the CM and player determine which skill is most appropriate. This also determines which characteristic is used. For example, if the character is attempting to bypass a security terminal by slicing its alarm system, the skill check would use the Computers skill which is linked to the Intellect characteristic. The ratings for these two attributes determine the number of Ability and/ or Proficiency dice that are added to the dice pool. Once the characteristic and skill are determined, the player can start building his dice pool. The player compares his ranks of skill training and the linked characteristic’s rating. The higher value between the two determines how many Ability dice are added to the skill check’s dice pool. Then the player upgrades a number of those Ability dice into Proficiency dice based on the lower of the two values. If a character is unskilled (possesses no ranks) in the necessary skill, that is automatically the lower value—zero—and the character will rely solely on the appropriate characteristic. (This would also apply if the character had no ranks in the characteristic in question; however, in practice, it is almost impossible for a character to have no ranks in a characteristic.) EX AM PLE 1: 4 1 -VEX 41-VEX is attempting to slice his way past a locked down security terminal. This uses 41 -VEX’s Computers skill and Intellect rating. 41- VEX has Computers 2 and Intellect 3. His Intellect is higher, so the player begins by adding three Ability dice ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) to his pool. His Computers skill is lower, so he upgrades that many dice (two) into Pro­ ficiency dice (O O). To attempt this ac­ tion, 41 -VEX starts out with three dice in his pool: O O O (one Ability die and two Proficiency dice). EX AM PLE 2: O S K A R A Later, Oskara the gear-head Twi’lek bounty hunter must attempt to slice past the same security terminal. Oskara is more experi­ enced with slicing and has the skill Comput­ ers 3. However, her Intellect is only 2. Her Computers skill is higher, so the player be­ gins by adding three Ability dice ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) to her pool. Her Intellect rating is lower, so she upgrades that many dice (two) into Proficiency dice (O O). To attempt this action, Oskara starts out with three dice in her pool: < > 0 0 (one Ability die and two Proficiency dice). APPLYING TASK DIFFICULTY After determining which skill and related character­ istic are required to attempt the task, the CM then chooses the level of difficulty for the task by consult­ ing Table 1 -3 : Difficulty Levels on page 17. The difficulty level of the task determines the number of Difficulty dice that the player must add to his pool. For example, an Average skill check means the player adds two Difficulty dice to the dice pool. In some cases, the CM may upgrade one or more of these Difficulty dice—removing them from the dice pool and replacing them with an equal number of Chal­ lenge dice. Difficulty dice are most often upgraded into Challenge dice when facing skilled opposition, particu­ larly challenging circumstances, or when Destiny points are invested to make a check more challenging. After setting the difficulty level for the task, the GM adds the corresponding number of Difficulty dice to the action's dice pool. If there are no other factors in­ fluencing the outcome of the attempt, the basic dice pool is now complete and can be rolled to determine success or failure, as well as any potential side effects. EXAM PLE: SETTING DIFFICULTY Following the p rior examples, the CM reviews the table of difficulty levels. She decides that this terminal is outdated and security is gener­ ally lax in this area, so she assigns a difficulty of Average ♦ ) to the task. Two Difficulty dice are added to the players’ dice pools when at­ tem pting to slice past this term inal’s security. MODIFYING A DICE POOL If there are no other influences or contributing factors that may impact the outcome of a task, the dice pool may consist of dice based solely on the acting charac­ ter’s skill and characteristic, along with the difficulty level set by the CM. Flowever, in a setting as diverse and action-packed as Star Wars, few actions occur in a vacuum. In fact, if an action is important enough to assemble and roll a dice pool, there’s a good chance other factors are involved. These other factors can affect or modify the dice pool in a number of ways. The most common ways are by adding dice, upgrading/downgrading dice, and re­ moving dice. These modifications may be triggered by the players, the GM, or may simply make sense given the environment and situation. Any number of fac­ tors may warrant modification of the dice pool, such as obstructing terrain, poor lighting, tactical advan­ tages, time constraints, superior equipment, special talents, unlocked career abilities, investment of Des­ tiny points, or critical injuries. The following sections describe these modifications in more detail. It is also important to note that when modifying a dice pool, players perform the modifications in a spe­ cific order. First, players assemble the basic pool. Then they add additional dice. Then they upgrade dice. Then they downgrade dice. Finally, they remove dice. ADDING DICE One way to modify the basic dice pool is to add dice to reflect environmental conditions or various advantages and disadvantages. This is done primar­ ily through the use of Boost and Setback dice. As a general rule, one Boost die □ is added to the dice pool for each bonus that would help the character succeed, and one Setback die ■ is added for each disadvantage or obstacle impeding success. A single Boost die □ is often enough to represent the benefits provided by useful gear, ample time, superior position, or the element of surprise. If more than one of these advantages are applicable, the CM may allow multiple Boost dice to be added to the dice pool. Likewise, a single Setback die ■ is usually enough to reflect the impact of detrimental or obstructing ef­ fects like poor lighting, inferior supplies, harsh envi­ ronments, or outside distractions. If more than one of these disadvantages are applicable, the CM may add multiple Setback dice to the dice pool. It is important to note that while these dice are es­ sentially mirror opposites in their use, Boost dice and Setback dice do not cancel each other out. If the situ­ ation warrants the addition of two Boost dice and one Setback die, all three dice ( □ □ ■ ) are added to the dice pool. The use of Boost dice and Setback dice is a com­ mon resource all players can use to help reinforce im­ portant elements of the story. Players are encouraged to describe their actions in detail, and point out both advantages and disadvantages that may influence a particular action. Some equipment may add Boost dice to a pool to reflect superior craftsmanship, or certain talents may allow a player to add Boost dice to a pool to reflect special training that applies to the situation. Maneu­ vers like aiming may also allow a player to add Boost dice to a pool. Conversely, some effects may specifi­ cally impose Setback dice, such as the defined effects of a critical injury, or a penalty for using inferior tools for a delicate task. While the players may suggest the addition of Boost or Setback dice, the GM is the final arbiter deciding which and how many dice are added to the pool. The CM does have access to helpful guidelines when making those decisions, as well as common sense based on how the scene and action have been described. See the Pos­ itive Dice and Negative Dice sidebar on page 9 for examples of the types of situations that may warrant the addition of Boost or Setback dice. EXAM PLE: A D D IN G □ A N D ■ For example, in the computer term inal slicing example used previously, the scene may have been described to reflect the character attem pt­ ing the task while under heavy fire from enemy forces (a disadvantage] and after suffering a broken w rist (a disadvantage]. Fortunately, the character acquired a fragment of the term inal’s passcode algorithms earlier (an advantage). Based on how the scene has been set up and described, the CM adds two Setback dice and one Boost die ( ■ ■ □ ) to the pool. UPGRADING AND DOWNGRADING DICE In addition to dice being added to the pool, some game effects improve a weaker die into a more potent die, or turn a potent die into a weaker die. Improving a die is called upgrading. Weakening a die is called downgrad­ ing. Upgrading and downgrading dice most often occurs when one of the participants invests a Destiny point into a skill check. Certain talents or special abilities may also allow a character to upgrade or downgrade dice. INCREASE, UPGRADE, DR ADD? T here may come times when the CM is un­ sure whether a situation should have the dif­ ficulty level increased or whether dice should be added or upgraded. The difficulty should be set based on the task itself, not on the circum­ stances surrounding that specific attempt at the task. In general, once set, the difficulty lev­ el remains the same, regardless of who. what, when, or why that particular task is attempted. Upgrading (or downgrading) dice is not usually necessary unless a specific rule or ability calls for it. These situations are defined by the indi­ vidual abilities, and are generally not applied arbitrarily by the CM. If the circumstances for this particular execu­ tion of the task are unique, then the CM may decide the task warrants the addition of Boost or Setback dice. Added dice should reflect the elements that make this attem pt distinct or special. As a general rule, if the CM feels that a skill check has distinct factors that would modify the outcome, he should consider using Boost and Setback dice. UPGRADING AND DOWNGRADING ABILITY AND DIFFICULTY Certain rules may call for a player to upgrade or downgrade the ability or difficulty of a dice pool. For example, the Dodge talent allows characters to upgrade the difficulty of a combat check by a certain value. Upgrading or downgrading the ability of a pool refers to upgrading Ability dice 0 into Proficiency dice # or downgrading Pro­ ficiency dice # to Ability dice <). Likewise, up­ grading or downgrading the difficulty of a pool refers to upgrading Difficulty dice 0 into Chal­ lenge dice O, or downgrading Challenge dice O into Difficulty dice <J>. UPGRADING DICE Upgrading dice is a mechanic specific to Ability dice and Difficulty dice. These are the only two types of dice that can be upgraded. When an Ability die <0 is upgraded, it is converted into a Proficiency die O- When a Difficulty die ^ is upgraded, it is converted into a Challenge die I f When a special talent or effect calls for one or more dice to be upgraded, the player first deter­ mines how many dice are to be upgraded. Once he determines this, he removes that number of Abil­ ity dice <0 or Difficulty dice ^ from the pool and replaces them with an equal number of either Pro­ ficiency dice O or Challenge dice # When an ef­ fect requires a character to upgrade dice, the rules always state whether A bility dice 0 or Difficulty dice ^ are being upgraded. UPGRADING MORE DICE THAN AVAILABLE There may be situations in which a player needs to upgrade Ability dice into Proficiency dice, but there are no more Ability dice remaining in the pool. In this case, the player performs the following steps. First, he determines how many dice upgrades remain. Then, using one upgrade, he adds one additional Ability die <0 to the pool. If any upgrade opportunities remain, he then upgrades the newly added Ability die 0 into a Proficiency die O. This process is repeated until all potential upgrades have been applied. Likewise, if a player needs to upgrade Difficulty dice into Challenge dice but there are no more Difficulty dice remaining, the same process is followed. First, one additional Difficulty die ^ is added, then if there are any more upgrades remaining, the Difficulty die ^ is upgraded into a Challenge die # , and so on. DOWNGRADING DICE Downgrading dice is also a specific mechanic, and applies only to Proficiency dice and Challenge dice. When a Proficiency die O is downgraded, it becomes UPGRADE VERSUS INCREASE Upgrading Difficulty dice «>) in a dice pool is different than increasing a skill check's difficul­ ty. Increasing or decreasing difficulty is simply a measure of how many Difficulty dice (<>) are added to the initial dice pool, and is covered in more detail on page 20. Upgrading Difficul­ ty dice (0) into Challenge dice (O) is generally triggered by a special ability or the investment of Destiny points by one of the participants. ana replaces them with an equal number of either Ability dice 0 or Difficulty dice ^ When an effect requires a character to downgrade dice, the rules al­ ways state whether Proficiency dice O or Challenge dice # are being downgraded. DOWNGRADING MORE DICE THAN AVAILABLE There may be situations where a player needs to downgrade Proficiency dice O into Ability dice <} or Challenge dice # into Difficulty dice ^ If all the po­ tential dice are already in their downgraded form, any further downgrades are ignored. UPGRADES & DOWNGRADES IN THE SAME POOL Sometimes abilities will call for both dice upgrades and downgrades. When this occurs, all upgrades are applied first. Then, any downgrades are applied. This is important, since upgrading dice could potentially add more dice to the overall pool. REMOVING DICE Just like some effects add Boost dice □ or Setback dice ■ to a pool, some effects remove dice from the pool before they are ever rolled. Most often this comes from character talents that allow the removal of Setback dice ■ from a pool, reflecting a level of ex­ pertise in overcoming minor distractions or disadvan­ tages that would rattle a less experienced character. In a similar fashion, a skilled enemy may have a talent that removes Boost dice □ from skill checks made against that enemy. The individual talent or effect describes what cir­ cumstances warrant the removal of dice, as well as the number and type of dice to be removed. If an ability would remove more dice of a type than there are in the dice pool, the maximum number of dice available are removed, and any addition­ al removals are ignored. Removing dice is done after all other dice have been added and all upgrades or downgrades have been applied. an Ability die <*> When a Challenge die # is down­ graded, it becomes a Difficulty die ^ When a special talent or effect calls for one or more dice to be downgraded, the player first deter­ mines how many dice are to be downgraded. Once he determines this, he removes that number of Pro­ ficiency dice O or Challenge dice # from the pool INTERPRETING THE POOL f l fter a dice pool is rolled, the players evaluate the results to resolve the outcome. The first outcome to resolve is determining the success or failure of the skill check. Then, the players can determine if any signifi­ cant side effects-good, bad, or both-are triggered. SUCCESSES & FAILURES If a skill check results in both Success symbols & and Failure symbols Y , the total numbers of each type of symbol are compared. Each Failure symbol Y cancels one Success symbol # . After all Failure symbols Y have canceled Success symbols # , a pool will either have one or more Success symbols & , one or more Failure symbols Y , or everything evenly canceled out. During this step, it is important to note that a Tri­ umph symbol (£ contributes one Success & to the pool, in addition to any special effects it may trigger. Likewise, a Despair symbol ^ contributes one Failure Y to the pool, in addition to its special effects. If all Successes & and Failures Y in the pool are canceled out, or if there are any net Failures Y re­ maining, the skill check fails. If at least one Success & remains, the skill check succeeds. Remember, a dice pool must have at least one Success symbol # re­ maining for a shill check to succeed. ADVANTAGES & THREATS It is also likely that a skill check results in either Ad­ vantage symbols O Threat symbols <§>, or both. The player adds up the total number of Threat symbols <§> and compares them to the total number of Advantage symbols O Each Threat symbol <§} cancels one Ad­ vantage symbol O After all Threat symbols <§> have canceled Advantage symbols O a pool will have one or more Advantage symbols O one or more Threat symbols <§>, or have everything evenly canceled out. Having one or more net Advantage symbols O in­ dictates a positive side effect or benefit. Having one or more net Threat symbols <§> indicates a negative side effect or complication with the check. If all the Advantages O or Threats <§> cancel each other out, there are no additional effects. This possibility for a positive or negative side effect can occur regardless of whether the task succeeds or fails. Advantage and Threat can be used to fuel a wide va­ riety of side effects. The player rolling the skill check generally chooses how to spend Advantage, such as triggering a weapon’s special ability, performing an additional maneuver, or possibly recovering some strain. Different weapons, talents, or equipment may have special uses for Advantage. Threat is generally spent by the CM to impose some sort of complication, with more severe complications requiring more Threat. Threat can result in a number of side effects such as a task taking longer to complete than expected, suffering strain, providing an opportu­ nity to an opponent, falling prone, or being subjected to an environmental effect. Different talents, environ­ ments, or opponents may have special uses for Threat. For more about taking Advantage or suffering from Threat, see page 205. TRIUM PH & DESPAIR Two symbols represent far more potent effects than the others. Triumph 0 and Despair ^ are special cases and operate slightly differently than the other symbols. Unlike Success and Failure ( # and Y ) or Ad­ vantage and Threat ( O and <§>), Triumph and Despair ((£ and do not completely cancel each other out. Rather, they indicate an especially positive or unfor­ tunately dire side effect. Remember that it is possible for a skill check to re­ sult in both (£> and ^ symbols. In this case, both re­ sults are interpreted separately. Just like Threat, it is possible for a skill check to succeed but still impose a Despair effect, or a skill check may fail but still trigger a Triumph effect. For more about the specific applica­ tions of Triumph and Despair, see page 205. TR IU M P H ($ A Triumph symbol has two effects. First, each Tri­ umph symbol (& counts as one Success symbol & Second, a Triumph result indicates an unexpected boon or significantly beneficial effect related to the task. Many weapons and talents have side effects that can be triggered using a Triumph result. Oth­ erwise, the scenario or GM may have other options for using Triumph. It is important to keep in mind that while a Triumph symbol does add a Success symbol # to the pool, the presence of one or more Triumph symbols <$) does not automatically mean a successful skill check. Triumph can be thought of as an enhanced, more powerful version of Advantage. For example, a single Triumph symbol can trigger any weapon’s special quality or inflict a critical injury, rather than requiring a certain number of Advantage symbols O Or, while Ad­ vantage may allow a character to recover strain, in the right situation a Triumph may allow recovery of a wound. DESPAIR ^ A Despair symbol ^ also has two effects. First, each Despair symbol ^ counts as one Failure symbol T . Second, a Despair result indicates an unfortunate consequence, significant complication, or dire effect related to the task. Opponent’s abilities, the environ­ meant, or the encounter description may offer different options for using Despair. Otherwise, the CM adjudi­ cates the results of Despair symbols ^ based on the situation. It is important to keep in mind that while a Despair symbol ^ does add a Failure symbol T to the pool, the presence of one or more Despair symbols ^ does not automatically mean a failed skill check. Despair can be viewed as an upgraded, more potent form of Threat. For example, a single Despair symbol & may trigger effects that would normally require sev­ eral Threat symbols <§>. Otherwise, Despair may be sig­ nificant enough to warrant inflicting wounds instead of strain, mean an important piece of equipment breaks, that a weapon jams or runs out of ammo, or coupled with failure, a grenade hits an unintended target. UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES With the opportunity for success or failure, as well as the myriad side effects possible through multiple Ad­ vantages, Threats, Triumphs, and Despairs, no two skill checks are the same. There are hundreds of possible outcomes with almost every skill check. A character may achieve a high-magnitude success with no other complications, or a low-magnitude success with Ad­ vantages, or a moderate success with Advantages that are tempered with Despair. Likewise, failed checks may have a silver lining by also featuring Advantage or Tri­ umph, or create truly dire situations in which failure is accompanied by both Threats and Despair. The sheer number of possibilities provide op­ portunities to narrate truly memorable action se­ quences and scenes. Players and CMs alike are en­ couraged to take these opportunities to think about how the symbols can help move the story along and add details and special effects that create action- packed sessions. OTHER TYPES OF CHECKS T he standard skill check using a basic dice pool can be used to resolve the vast majority of tasks in a game session. However, there may be some situations that require a slightly different approach to properly resolve. In addition to the standard skill check, E dge of the Em p ir e uses opposed checks, competitive checks, and assisted checks. Opposed checks are often used when the success or failure of the task is strongly influenced by an op­ ponent. Competitive checks can be used to deter­ mine which character performs better when two or more characters are attempting the same task. As­ sisted checks are simply variations of other checks, but two or more characters are working together. OPPOSED CHECKS Sometimes a task is more difficult to accomplish be­ cause someone is actively trying to prevent the char­ acter from succeeding, or one character is trying to overcome or bypass another character. For example, a suspected thief lies to the local governor, claiming he had nothing to do with the burglary of medical sup­ plies. The thief's Deception check might be opposed by the governor’s Vigilance. Opposed checks are most often applicable when a task involves directly opposing the task that another character is performing, or when a task involves trying to go unno­ ticed, undetected, or undiscovered by someone else. Opposed checks add ^ and potentially # to the skill check’s dice pool, similar to standard checks. However, rather than assigning a general difficulty lev­ el to an opposed check, a quick comparison between the active and opposing characteristics and skill rat­ ings determines the difficulty of an opposed check. The active character’s dice pool starts out using the same rules as building a basic dice pool, using 4) and potentially upgrading some into O based on his charac­ teristic and skill rating. The opposition then introduces^ and # based on its relevant characteristic and skill rat­ ing. The opposition’s higher value between its character­ istic and skill determines how many ^ are added to the pool, while the lower value indicates how many of those dice are upgraded into # (see upgrading on page 21). E X AM PLE: O PP O SED CHECKS For example, Hash the smuggler is trying to sneak past a security patrol. Hash has Agility 4 and Stealth 2, building an initial dice pool of four Abil­ ity dice, two of which are upgraded to Proficiency dice O O in total). The security patrol has Cunning 2 and Perception 1. Therefore the oppo­ sition adds two Difficulty dice to the check, one of which is subsequently upgraded to a Chal­ lenge die # . If there are no other factors, the skill check has six dice: ♦ ♦ o o f f Sometimes, several people are trying to accomplish the same goal at the same time, or are trying to de­ determine who performs a task better than the other. When multiple characters are attem pting the same task and trying to determine who accomplishes the task first, performs the task better, or measure some other outcome, they are engaging in a com­ petitive check. For example, two characters engage in a friendly arm-wrestling contest at the local cantina. Each one has the same goal—to win the match by pinning his opponent's arm. This is a competitive check to see who outperforms the other. Other competitive checks could include several pilots navigating the Kessel Run to find who completes the run in the shortest distance, or two politicians try ­ ing to win over an undecided crowd during a council hearing. For a competitive check, the CM assigns a difficulty level for the task, and each character involved in the competition makes a skill check based on that d if­ ficulty. When characters make a competitive check, it is important to track how many total # they gener­ ate with their respective dice pools. The character with the most total & “wins" the check. If neither character succeeds in their check, then neither character wins, and the competitive check results in a draw. If two or more characters generate the same number of the check goes to a tiebreaker to see if the draw can be resolved. Although O and ($) still provide their customary effects in these situations, they also provide one additional benefit. If the two characters tie with the number of net & they generate, the character with the greater number of (J) becomes the winner. If the characters are also tied for number of (£. the charac­ ter with more total O is declared the winner. If the characters are still tied after evaluating these categories, the competitive check is a draw. In this case, the CM must determine a sole winner; this case could count as all tied parties losing, or the CM may decide to resolve the draw using an­ other competitive check, or find some other means to settle the competition. C O M P E TITIV E CHECKS For example, Oskara the Twi’lek bounty hunter and Lowhhrick the Wookiee hired gun engage in a friendly drinking contest. The players decide to go for the good stuff, drinking Corellian brandy, a notoriously potent potable. The GM decides the drinking contest will require a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Resilience check. Oskara has Brawn 3 and Re­ silience 1, while Lowhhrick has Brawn 4 and Re­ silience 3. Oskara manages to generate & & O O Despite his superior brawn, Lowhhrick only manages to generate # (£ <§> <§) <§>. Lowhhrick wins the competitive check based on the tiebreak­ er (since the ($) also counts as a Success). Oskara also has two O to resolve, while Lowhhrick must contend with three One interpretation is that while Lowhhrick wins the contest, he wakes up the next morning with an awful hangover, while Oskara gets a restful night’s sleep. ASSISTED CHECKS Some tasks are important or challenging enough that help is required—or at the least appreciated. Fortunately, characters can provide assis­ tance to each other when per­ forming a variety of tasks. Over the course of normal narrative play, providing assistance is easy. A player simply needs to explain how his character is helping with the task. If the explanation is reasonable, the CM may award assis­ tance. There are two types of assistance that can be provided—skilled assistance and unskilled assistance. SKILLED ASSISTANCE Assistance works best when the assisting party brings additional insight or expertise to the task. When a character with a higher characteristic or skill rating provides assistance to another character, the dice pool may use one PCs characteristic, and the other PC's skill rating. EX AM PLE: SKILLED ASSISTANCE 41-VEX the droid is assisting Hash the smuggler with an Astrogation check to set hyperdrive co­ ordinates. Hash has Intellect 2 and Astrogation 3, and 41-VEX has Intellect 3 and Astrogation 1. The player chooses to use 41 -VEX’s Intellect 3 and Pash’s Astrogation 3 when making the skill check, resulting in the following dice pool: O O O . EXAMPLE: COMPETITIVE CHECKS UNSKILLED ASSISTANCE If the assisting party does not have a higher charac­ teristic or skill rating, so that using either rating pro­ vides no benefit to the other character, the GM may add □ to the dice pool (representing the fact that the additional assistance is still providing some benefit). EXAM PLE: U N S K ILLE D ASSISTANCE Later Hash finds himself needing to assist 41 -VEX in tending to a shipmate’s wounds. 41 -VEX has In­ tellect 3 and Medicine 3, while Hash has Intellect 2 and no ranks of Medicine. Hash cannot provide skilled assistance, so 41-VEX gains one Boost die on the skill check to reflect Pash’s attempts to help, resulting in the following dice pool: O O O E L ASSISTANCE RESTRICTIONS The GM may stipulate certain conditions or require­ ments to offer assistance. To assist with tending to an injury, the assisting character needs to be next to the person being tended to, or to assist with translating an ancient holocron, the assisting character may need access to the holocron. Generally, only one character can provide assis­ tance at a time. However, the GM may decide that certain situations accommodate more people. In this case, only one assisting character can offer his char­ acteristic or skill rating—all other participating char­ acters contribute □ to the check. ASSISTANCE A N D T IM IN G During combat or structured encounters, when initia­ tive and the order in which people act is more impor­ tant, assistance can be accomplished by performing the assist maneuver. The assist maneuver allows an ally to benefit from assistance provided by an en­ gaged ally on his next skill check. Assistance only lasts until the assisted character’s next activation. For more on the assist maneuver, see Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat OTHER KEY ELEMENTS I n addition to the fundamental concepts discussed previously in this chapter, there are several other concepts that inform gameplay, advance the story, and help PCs overcome adversity. This section de­ scribes a number of these key elements, including character talents, Destiny Points, Obligation, experi­ ence and development, and derived attributes such as wound and strain thresholds. TALENTS Where skills represent what a character knows, prac­ ticed disciplines, or applied experience to a topic, talents are a much broader class of special ability. Tal­ ents represent various tricks, techniques, and knacks characters pick up over their career, or reflect their sheer determination to get things done. Each talent is a distinct special ability that provides the character with an edge in certain situations. While characteristics and skills are fairly universal— every character has six characteristics, and everyone has access to all the skills—talents are far more spe­ cific. Each career is defined by a series of unique tal­ ents bundled together in a format called talent trees. These talent trees represent the specializations within each career, and help distinguish characters advanc­ ing along separate career paths. Talents are divided into several categories and are either active or passive. Active talents typically require the player to state that his character is using them. Some active talents have a cost or requirement associ­ ated with them, such as investing a Destiny Point, suf­ fering strain, or using it as part of an attack action. Oth­ er talents are passive, meaning they are always "on’’ and don’t need to be activated by the player. Passive talents either constantly provide their benefit, or are automatically triggered under certain circumstances. Some talents belong to a series of related talents. These may either represent improved versions of lower level talents, or identical talents taken multiple times for a cumulative effect. In the former case, an improved version of a talent completely replaces the lower level version. In the latter case, the talent is measured with a series of ranks. The more times that talent is taken, the more ranks it has, and the greater the magnitude of its effects. The majority of talents are specific to a character’s given profession. Talent trees represent the natural flow of learning and experience that a character gains throughout adventures. Talent trees are divided up into five tiers—the higher tiers representing remark­ able abilities. Some talents may appear across mul­ tiple specializations, but at different tiers or costs. There are also some special talent trees, such as Force Sensitivity, which are not tied to a specific profession or career, but function in much the same way. For a full description of each talent and how they are used in play, see Chapter IV: Talents. DESTINY POINTS Player characters are cut from a different cloth than most NPCs that populate the galaxy. Not only do they have access to skills and special talents to help them succeed, PCs are intimately connected to des­ tiny. Destiny is that special spark that elevates heroes above commoners, imbuing an individual with enough significance in the galaxy’s events to be a Player Char­ acter. Over the course of the PCs’ adventures, destiny may intervene on their behalf for good or ill. Destiny may manifest in a positive way and provide a tempo­ rary advantage or boost to a PC's abilities. Or destiny may prove an ill omen and impose additional hard­ ships and complications. The concept of destiny and the Player Characters’ ability to tap into and influence this resource is repre­ sented by Destiny Points. Destiny is interwoven with the Force, which pervades the galaxy with both light energy and dark energy. Destiny is one way the Force guides and surrounds the characters. Destiny Points are a resource that can be invested by either the players or the CM for a variety of differ­ ent effects. For example, Destiny Points may be used to upgrade Ability dice or Difficulty dice, or trigger certain talents or special abilities. THE POOL OF DESTINY Like the Force, destiny has both a light side and a dark side. Light side Destiny Points favor the characters and can be used to aid them in their actions. Dark side Destiny Points impede the characters, and are used by the CM to imperil and complicate their ac­ tions. However, the light side and dark side are two sides of the same coin, struggling for balance, endur­ ing the other side’s strengths, and exploiting the other side’s weaknesses. As the pool of light side Destiny ebbs, the dark side’s Destiny pool grows. As dark side Destiny Points are consumed, light side Destiny Points are replenished. PREPARING THE DESTINY POOL To determine the current Destiny pool, at the begin­ ning of each game session, each player with a PC rolls one Force Die O (the GM does not roll a O). The results of the Force dice are tallied to become the starting Destiny pool for that session. For example, if a player rolls one light side symbol (O). he adds one light side Destiny Point to the session’s Destiny pool. If a player rolls two dark side symbols ( # • , he adds two dark side Destiny Points to the Destiny pool. Once set, the size of the Destiny pool does not change for that session. Before the next session, play­ ers will roll and generate a new Destiny pool which may have a different number and composition of Des­ tiny Points. While the Destiny pool size is fixed for a session, the number of light side and dark side Des­ tiny Points available can change frequently as players and CM call on destiny to influence their actions. TRACKING DESTINY POINTS Destiny Points can be easily tracked using the Desti­ ny Point tokens found in the Edge of the Empire D ice Pac k, or with gaming tokens, glass beads, or using some other convenient method. Two-sided tokens or chips work especially well. Ideally, one side is col­ ored or designated to represent light side Destiny Points, and the other side designated to represent dark side Destiny Points. Another easy method involves using the group char­ acter sheet on page 447. This sheet has a light side and dark side circle on it for Destiny Points. Using a number of beads or tokens, players place the appropri­ ate number of Destiny Points in the appropriate circle. As Destiny Points are used, the tokens are moved from one circle to the other. HOW DESTINY POINTS ARE USED All players and the GM can tap into destiny by us­ ing the Destiny Points in the pool. There are several distinct ways players and CMs spend destiny. How­ ever, the Player Characters may only spend light side Destiny Points, and the CM may only spend dark side Destiny Points. When a player spends a light side Destiny Point, it is converted into a dark side Destiny Point after the cur­ rent action is resolved. When the GM spends a dark side Destiny Point, it is then converted into a light side Des­ tiny Point in the same fashion. Conversion takes place at the end of the action during which the Destiny Point was used, preventing players or CMs from immediately spending a just-converted Destiny Point. Destiny is a powerful resource, but it is limited. A player can only spend one light side Destiny Point during a single ac­ tion, and so should think carefully about how they want to use their destiny before doing so. The CM likewise is limited to spending one dark side point per action. The following section explains some of the ways in which Destiny Points can be used. Unless noted otherwise, either the players or the CM may use these options. A HELPING HAND All characters have the opportunity to call on des­ tiny to enhance any skill check they are about to attem pt. A player may spend one Destiny Point to upgrade his starting dice pool by one step. This re­ fers to upgrading an Ability die into the superior Pro­ ficiency die. The GM may spend a dark side Destiny Point in this way to upgrade one of his NPCs dice pools. Additional information on upgrading dice can be found on page 2 1 . RAISING THE STAKES Destiny can also be used to help keep characters out of harm's way. Characters can call on destiny to make an opponent's skill check more challenging. A single player may spend one light side Destiny Point to up­ grade the difficulty in any NPCs skill check by one step. This refers to upgrading a Difficulty die into the more potent Challenge die. The CM may spend a dark side Destiny Point in this way to upgrade one of the PC's dice pools. Additional information on upgrading dice can be found on page 2 1 . SPECIAL ABILITIES A N D TALENTS Many powerful talents allow characters to spend Des­ tiny Points for various effects. For example, a savvy Politico can spend a Destiny Point to immediately re­ cover from strain equal to his Presence rating. Many other uses exist as well—see the individual talent de­ scriptions for details. LUCK A N D DEUS EX MACHINA Destiny can also be used by the players to introduce "facts” and additional context directly into the narra­ tive. The GM already does this by managing and direct­ ing the story, but this use of Destiny Points provides the players with a means to make contributions as well. Imagine the characters land on a planet they expect­ ed to have a breathable atmosphere, only to find a leak at the gas mining facility has rendered the air toxic. One of the players suggests spending a Destiny Point, saying "Good thing you remembered to pack those re­ breathers last time we were in dry dock, Hash." While none of the players may have specifically mentioned or listed rebreathers before, it’s a sensible and creative addition to the game. If the GM agrees, the Destiny Point is spent and the player’s contribution is now a true statement—there are rebreathers handy. Similarly, a player may spend a Destiny Point in this manner to suggest finding a spare stimpack while quickly scavenging through a medical facility, or in­ troducing a terrain feature the character can duck behind for cover. Using Destiny Points narratively is a great way to keep all of the players involved and keep the story moving forward. However, the GM has final say over what is or is not acceptable. Players should not abuse this use of Destiny Points; the more outrageous or unlikely the suggestion, the more likely the GM will curtail the players' use of Destiny Points. Ultimately, this use of Destiny Points allows the players to feel empowered as active participants in both the game and the story by rewarding creativity and roleplaying. If the Destiny Point use would fulfill this goal, the GM should consider allowing it. DESTINY POINT ECONOMY IN GAMEPLAY All players and the GM are encouraged to use des­ tiny regularly, creating an ebb and flow of destiny over the course of a session. While the players could theo­ retically "lock” all the Destiny Points and simply not spend any light side Destiny Points to prevent the GM from using dark side Destiny Points against them, this works both against the spirit of the mechanics and the setting. Players that horde their Destiny Points may find the GM using other methods of putting pres­ sure on the group, forcing them to reconsider their plan. It’s perfectly acceptable for the GM to remind the players about using Destiny Points in play, such as suggesting the use of Destiny Points if they are feeling overmatched by a tough enemy. The Player Characters are wrapped up in the fate of the galaxy, and through their adventures destiny will work both for and against them. When used wisely, Destiny Points provide tension and excitement by making routine checks more significant, adding an el­ ement of drama to the mundane, or helping provide a boost when the players are overwhelmed. THE LIMITS OF LUCK Destiny is a powerful resource and should not be abused. Destiny must also be used wisely—each player can only invest one Destiny Point into any single check. If a player chooses to invest a Destiny Point to upgrade an Ability die into a Proficiency die, for example, he cannot also invest a Destiny Point to trigger one of his character’s talents. The GM may also choose to invest one Destiny Point per skill check. This does introduce the possibility that both the player and the GM invest destiny into the same skill check, resulting in no net difference to the overall Destiny pool balance. The active player (the player or GM forming the dice pool) always has the first chance to use a Des­ tiny Point. Once he has decided whether or not he will use a Destiny Point, the other party involved in the check (the targeted player, or the GM in the case of an NPC) has the opportunity to respond and spend a Destiny Point as well. For example, if the GM declares he will be spending a Destiny Point to upgrade an enemy's A bility die into a Proficiency die for an attack against a PC, that PC’s player has the opportunity to then use a Destiny Point, either to upgrade one of the Difficulty dice in the attack pool into a Challenge die, or perhaps to trigger one of the PC’s talents. OBLIGATIONS Q ne of the elements that makes characters in Edge of the Empire unique is the concept of Obligation. During character creation, players not only customize their PCs by selecting skills and talents, but by choosing what sort of Obligation the PC has. A group may share the same Obligation, or each PC may have his own. Narratively, Obligation can come in many forms. An Obligation may represent a large debt or the PC being blackmailed. A PC may owe a crime boss a “favor" or have a bounty on his head. Obligation helps tell the character’s story and reinforces the gritty experiences of Edge of the Empire. Over the course of a campaign, Obligations can come into play in several ways—either as plot hooks and char­ acter motivations or as compelling PC decisions. For ex­ ample, the characters complete an assignment and re­ ceive a sizable payment. Do the characters spend those credits to make repairs on their ship—or pay down their Obligation? Obligation helps provide short-term deci­ sions, long-term goals, and story hooks that help tie together campaigns and shape the "fringe” experience. OBLIGATION IN PLAY In addition to the narrative implications, Obligation has mechanical impact, as well. Before each session, the CM rolls a dOO and compares it to the group’s current outstanding Obligation. If the roll is greater than the to­ tal Obligation, they’ve stayed off the grid or under the radar enough that it doesn’t come back to haunt them— yet. If the roll is equal to or less than the total Obligation, it comes into play and impacts the session in some man­ ner. The character whose Obligation is triggered feels the heat, and may suffer penalties or strain under the scrutiny or pressure of his Obligations. While players create Obligations for their characters, it is another tool for the CM to help reinforce the story, motivate characters, and even provide rewards. Play­ ers feel a real sense of relief when they have the oppor­ tunity to pay down or settle part of their Obligation. For more information on Obligation, see page 38. EXPERIENCE & DEVELOPMENT E xperience is the primary means by which players customize their characters. Each character starts with a beginning pool of experience points that can be spent during character creation to train skills, improve characteristics, or acquire talents. During a campaign, players also receive additional experience for each session of Edge of the Em pir e, which can also be spent to improve their characters. STARTING EXPERIENCE POINTS Characters begin with a budget of experience points based on their species. The experience points used dur­ ing character creation are the same "currency" as expe­ rience points received during play. If a player chooses to spend fewer experience points during character cre­ ation than his budget, those points carry over into the game and the PC will begin with more experience points to spend once his adventures begin. More information on spending these experience points can be found in Chapter II: Character Creation on page 92. IM PRO VING CHARACTERISTICS Raising a characteristic during character creation costs ten times the value of the next highest rat­ ing. During character creation, no characteristic can be increased higher than five. During the course of play, no characteristic can be increased higher than six. Characteristics may only be purchased with ex­ perience points during character creation, not at any later time. During gameplay, characteristics can only be increased by acquiring specific, high-tier talents. For more on raising characteristics, see page 92. SKILL TRAINING Each skill has five ranks of training available. A char­ acter may have already acquired several ranks of skill training from his starting career and profession for free. Characters may train additional skills and gain additional ranks during character creation. Regard­ less of any species or career bonuses, no skill can be raised higher than rank 2 during character creation. The cost for training skills falls into one of two catego­ ries—career skills and non-career skills. Training a career skill costs five times the value of the next highest rank. Training a non-career skill costs five times the value of the next highest rank plus 5 additional experience points. Characters may purchase ranks in skills during character creation or later during gameplay. ACQUIRING TALENTS Talents are acquired from a character's available tal­ ent trees, generally provided by their specialization choices. A character can purchase any talents he is eligible for. An eligible talent is any talent in the top row (which cost 5 experience points each), or any tal­ ent that is directly connected to an already acquired talent. Talents cost a variable amount, based on which tier the talent is on. Similar talents may cost different­ ly for different characters based on their specializa­ tions. Characters may purchase talents during charac­ ter creation or later during gameplay. ACQUIRING NEW SPECIALIZATIONS Each character starts with a single specialization within his chosen career. Flowever, characters may purchase additional specializations, giving them access to a broader range of skills and talents. There is no limit as to the number of specializations a character possesses. Acquiring a specialization allows the character to spend experience points in the new specialization’s talent tree, in addition to any he already has access to. Also, most specializations have one or more career skills. These skills now count as career skills for the character. Characters can purchase specializations from any career. Purchasing an additional specialization within a character’s career costs 10 times the total number of specializations he would possess with this new specialization. Purchasing non-career specializa­ tions costs 10 times the total number of specializa­ tions he would possess with this new specialization, plus an additional 10 experience. DERIVED ATTRIBUTES DEFENSE Defense determines how difficult a character is to hit in combat situations. Characters have both a ranged defense and a melee defense. A character’s default value in both ranged defense and melee defense is zero. If a character’s defense value is listed simply as “ Defense" and not specifically defined by separate ranged and melee values, then the same value is ap­ plied to both his ranged and melee defense. Defense is most commonly gained by wearing ar­ more, or by adopting a defensive position in combat, such as gaining cover. Some special talents may also increase one of the character’s defense ratings. SOAK VALUE A character’s soak value determines how much in­ coming damage he can shrug off before taking real damage. The soak value is subtracted from any in­ coming damage to the character. Any remaining dam­ age after subtracting the soak value becomes wounds applied against the character’s wound threshold. A character’s default soak value is equal to his Brawn rating. After determining this initial value, in­ creases to a character’s Brawn rating do increase his soak value. Additional soak value bonuses are most often gained by wearing armor. Some talents may also increase a character’s innate soak value. S ome character attributes are based on other choices made during character creation or over the course of a campaign. Some of these attributes may change frequently over the course of play, or be modi­ field by talents, equipment, or other special abilities. W OUND THRESHOLD A character’s wound threshold represents how much physical damage he can withstand before he is knocked out. Wounds can be serious and lead to criti­ cal injury. Wounds can be treated with Medicine but may take time to recover (droids use Mechanics to repair wounds instead). A character's starting wound threshold is deter­ mined based on his species and his Brawn rating. After determining this initial value, increases to a character’s Brawn rating do not increase his wound threshold; wound threshold improvements are acquired by pur­ chasing the appropriate talent, such as Toughened. STRAIN THRESHOLD A character’s strain threshold represents how much duress a character can withstand before he is stunned, dazed, or otherwise incapacitated. Strain represents psychological or mental ‘’damage’’ to the character. Strain is more easily suffered than wounds, and can even be used as a resource by players to trigger cer­ tain character abilities. Thankfully, characters recover from strain more quickly than from wounds. A character’s starting strain threshold is determined based on his race and his Willpower rating. After de­ termining this initial value, increases to a character’s Willpower rating do not increase his strain threshold- strain threshold improvements are acquired by purchasing appropriate talents, such as Grit. CHARACTER CREATION E dge of the Em pire focuses on the "fringes" of the Star Wars galaxy, including the little explored regions of the O uter Rim, the seedy underworld, and the outlier characters that inhabit these murky domains. The Player Characters of Edge of the Em ­ pire also embody this idea. Although the PCs may have come from a background of wealth, privilege, and status, they now find themselves in a situation where few things are truly black and white and even getting by from day to day is fraught with complica­ tions and danger. When a group of players decides to start an Edge of the Empire campaign, special emphasis should be placed on the background of their characters. Spend­ ing some time before the actual act of coming up with characteristics, talents, equipment, and other "hard" attributes goes a long way toward creating a vibrant, interesting character for everyone to enjoy. . “Scoundrel I like the'sound of that." -Han Solo CHARACTER GENERATION Creating a character for Edge of the Empire is done in just a few short steps, allowing players to get-involved in the action right away. To create a character, a player needs this rulebook, a character sheet, and a pencil. Addition­ ally, the player needs access to the dice pool (see page 10)—either his own or the group's collection. Character generation uses a point buy system, mean­ ing each player has a budget of experience points he can invest in different aspects of his character. Charac­ ters begin with a modest experience point budget— but players have th.e option to take on additional Obli­ gation (debt, favors, bounties on their heads) for more experience points of additional starting funds, which is described in- detail later in this chapter. Selecting a character's race and career determines the character's starting characteristics and skills. After those initial choices, players invest their experience points to improve starting characteristics, acquire training in key skills, choose starting equipment, learn special talents, and even unlock additional talent trees. CHARACTER CONCEPT Before a player starts generating attributes, he should put some thought into what sort of character he wants to play. Does he want to play a roguish pilot, quick to wdraw his blaster when things get sticky? A taciturn explorer driven to see everything the galaxy has to offer? In Edge of the Em pir e, any character concept found within the Star Wars universe is possible. The GM should give the players an idea on what sort of campaign he intends to run for the players. If the game focuses heavily on combat, the players may consider choosing more martially-oriented char­ acters. If the campaign runs deep with intrigue, then building characters with strong social abilities and skills makes more sense. The GM should encourage the players to discuss what kind of careers might be the most useful during a campaign. Ideally, a group of PCs should include a mix of characters to ensure they’ll survive whatever the GM comes up with, keeping the campaign style in mind—someone who can fight well, someone who can pilot a ship, a person that can fix machines, and so on. Some overlap may occur, but there is enough variety in Edce of the Empire that even if two play­ ers choose the same career, each could offer his own unique abilities and talents. It should be noted that no character is ever a "wrong" choice, regardless of the campaign. The GM should never discourage a player from a particular character choice and should integrate all the charac­ ter concepts into the campaign at hand. Indeed, part of the fun that comes from playing Edge of the Empire is the interesting mix of characters thrust together during a campaign. GENERATION STEPS To create a character, each player follows these steps. The steps are briefly explained below, then broken down into more detail throughout the course of this chapter. 1. Determine Character Concept and Background 2. Determine Starting Obligation 3. Select Character Species 4. Select Character Career 5. Select Specializations 6. Invest Experience Points 7. Determine Derived Attributes 8. Determine Starting Motivations 9. Choose Gear and Description 10. Croup Chooses Starting Ship DETERMINE CHARACTER CONCEPT AND BACKGROUND Every character starts as an idea. Does a player want to play a dashing scoundrel of a smuggler, a brawny Wook- iee pilot, or a feared and competent bounty hunter? Be­ fore starting, the player should take a few moments and think about the character he wants to build and what he wants his character’s background to be. Basically, where did he come from, and what happened to make him into the character he is today? No person springs into being fully formed. Individuals are influenced by a lifetime of decisions and circumstances, starting from birth. More on determining a character’s background is covered on page 36. DETERMINE STARTING OBLIGATION When creating an Edge of the Empire character, the player chooses a starting Obligation early on. It can inform other decisions a player makes during charac­ ter creation, such as the type of character he wants to play, what sort of overall group the players collec­ tively want, and the sorts of skills, gear, and abilities they may wish to start with. More on Obligation is covered on page 38. SELECT CHARACTER SPECIES The galaxy is a crowded place, full of numerous sentient species that all have their own unique abilities and beliefs. After a character’s Obligation is determined, the player should define the character’s species. Once selected, it can never be changed. A character’s species determines its starting characteristic ratings for Brawn, Agility, Intel­ lect, Cunning, Willpower, and Presence. It also provides default wound threshold and strain threshold values, as well as innate abilities, bonuses, and starting XP. More on the various species players can choose from can be found on page 43. SELECT CHARACTER CAREER A career sets the character along a certain path or way of life, but is by no means limiting. A career is a broad archetype or template of related skills and abilities. Within each career are a number of specializations. Each career has eight associated career skills. These skills should be checked on the character sheet to indi­ cate they are career skills. During this step of character creation, the player may choose four of the eight start­ ing career skills and gain one rank in each of the select­ ed skills free (he does not spend experience points). He may not choose the same skill more than once. During play, career skills are less expensive to train and improve than non-career skills. More on the six careers can be found on page 53. SELECT SPECIALIZATIONS Each career has several specializations within its broader definition. Specializations are more focused, and provide special abilities called talents. Each char­ acter gains access to one specialization without spend­ ing experience at character creation. That specializa­ tion must be one in his chosen career. Each specialization also includes four additional ca­ reer skills. These four skills should be marked on the character sheet as career skills if they are not already marked. During this step of character creation, the player may choose two of the four additional career skills and gain one rank in each (without spending ex­ perience). He may not choose the same skill more than once. However, he may choose to train a skill that was also trained during the career selection step, allowing the character to start with a skill trained to level two. If the character can choose multiple Specializations at character creation (whether due to some factor of char­ acter creation or because he purchases an additional Specialization with starting experience) he must select one and only one Specialization from which to choose his two free ranks in two career skills. More on specific specializations can be found with­ in the career sections starting on page 55. A full list and descriptions of each talent in this book can be found starting on page 1 29. INVEST EXPERIENCE POINTS During character creation, experience points can be invested into one of four ar­ eas of character development: improving character­ istics, training skills, acquiring talents, and learning new specializations. A player may spend experience points on any combination of these developments to create a truly unique character. Players do gain additional experience points throughout the course of gameplay. The amount of experience they gain is determined by the CM; more information about this can be found in Chapter IX: The Game Master Players can spend experience points during charac­ ter creation and at the end of each game session when they receive additional experience points. More about spending experience points can be found on page 92 DETERMINE DERIVED ATTRIBUTES There are several important attributes for each character that can only be determined after investing experience points. These help further define the character's resil­ ience and combat abilities. These attributes are wound threshold, strain threshold, defense, and soak value. Specifics on how to determine derived attributes can be found starling on page 94. DETERMINE STARTING MOTIVATIONS In addition to a starting Obligation, every player should begin with a starting Motivation for his character. Moti­ vations provide additional story elements for both the player and GM to draw from. Characters can gain ad­ ditional experience point (XP) bonuses if the GM deter­ mines that the player kept true to his character’s Moti­ vation throughout the course of the adventure. The three primary Motivations from which a player may choose for his character are Ambition, Cause, and Relationship. Once the primary Motivation is de­ terminated, the player rolls percentile dice on the ap­ propriate specific Motivation table to provide further detail. For more information on determining and uti­ lizing Motivations during play, see page 94. CHOOSE GEAR AND DESCRIPTION Once all of the other characteristics and derived at­ tributes are determined, the player can then flesh out the rest of his character, such as height, weight, build, hair or skin color, planet of origin, and other cosmetic details. Ideally, background details should tie in with the character’s Obligations and Motivation (see page 38 and page 94 respectively). Lastly, the player comes up with the character’s name and selects starting gear. GROUP CHOOSES STARTING SHIP In Edge of the Em pire, the characters are assumed to be independent freelancers and have the advantage of starting play with their own starship to move from place to place (and adventure to adventure). Once all of the characters have been finalized, the group should discuss the type of starship they will use as their “home base." This section provides a list of choices from which the GM and players can select their group’s starship. STEP 1: CHARACTER BACKGROUNDS A s the player begins sketching out his character’s back­ ground, he should consider the general status level of the character’s previous life. Did he come from squalor and poverty? Did he live a comfortable life? Was he des­ tined for a greater position later on? Even something as simple as “my character was a formerly rich heir to a noble family” provides a wealth of ideas upon which to build his backstory and ^help deter­ mine both his start­ ing Obligation and Motivation. Backgrounds are not mechanical aspects of charac­ ter development; instead, they are thematic facets of a character that help define him as more than a set of numbers. Players do not need to give their characters backgrounds, but they help make characters far more in­ teresting. Shown here are four broad descriptions of so­ cial backgrounds to help provide the players with ideas about where their characters came from and what they left behind when they began their lives of adventure. THE DOWN AND OUT The player may decide that the character comes from humble or hardscrabble beginnings. Perhaps he was a moisture farmer on some barren world, an indentured servant working for the Hutts, or abandoned from a young age to survive in the depths of Coruscant’s un­ derworld. This character starts out knowing that life is nasty, brutish, and short and probably has seen more than his share of horror. He may have seen friends and family members die from malnutrition, dis­ ease, or violence and witnessed tremendous in­ justice done to the weak or vulnerable. Despite (or because of] this harsh, early view of the universe, characters from this type of background strive to bet­ ter themselves and do their utmost to escape their plight. The character either trains incessantly, picking up knowledge any way that he can, or simply is tough and resourceful enough to go out on his own. However, leaving this rough-and-tumble life might not be as easy as it seems. The character may still have family left behind in squalor, former comrades that take a dim view of him leaving a gang, or former “employers" that want the character to finish up their "contracts.” MIDDLE CLASS STRUGGLES Sometimes a character comes from modest, but com­ fortable conditions prior to entering a life of adven­ true. The character and his family did not come from vast wealth and they know the meaning of hard work to get ahead. This "middle class" background may be the hardest of all to leave, for the character had a taste of the good (or at least decent) life and finds that getting into adventuring is harder than it appears. This broad category could include anything from a skilled technician, minor political official, professional soldier, or any other lifestyle that typically involves hard work—but with the pay to make it worthwhile. The character lived comfortably, but put in long hours to make ends meet. He’s no stranger to hard work and certain levels of injustice, but may have been shielded from the truly darker side of the galaxy—crime, cor­ ruption, slavery, and conflict. THE HIGH AND MIGHTY As the saying goes, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Even characters from high social standing, great wealth, or an existence of comfort can still be subject to the whims of fate and find themselves cast out from the life they once knew. This fall from grace could come in many forms—scandal, poor business decisions, war and revolution, or revenge from ene­ mies. Regardless of the method, the character is ir­ revocably wrenched from his world and cast into the murky shadows of Edge of the Em pir e. Characters from this type of background include landed gentry, wealthy business owners, doctors, politi­ cians, and any other position or upbringing that brings with it money, power, and status above that of the com­ mon rabble. After the events that push them out of that world, however, these previously entitled characters find a rough life ahead. The character might find himself fleeing his former life with only the (admittedly upscale) clothes on his back and nothing else but his abilities, skills, and will to survive in the unforgiving galaxy. A character from this background typically finds his Obligations tied to the cause of his downfall. Perhaps his fall came from a huge gambling debt, blackmail from a family enemy, or bringing shame upon his clan that results in exile. As the wealthy and powerful typi­ cally rub elbows with those of their own social level, enemies or "holders" of the character’s Obligation are also typically wealthy, powerful, and influential in their own right. THE OUTSIDER A character from this background came from a society outside of the galactic norm. This includes isolated plan­ etary systems not yet marked on the maps, prison colo­ nies, or even the rare case of a character growing up in solitude out in the wilderness. The character is probably ill-informed about or completely unaware of the politics, customs, and even technology of the rest of the galaxy. He may be superstitious of the strange sights around him or embrace the wonders that he encounters. This choice works better for some careers than oth­ ers—a Mechanic from a primitive world stretches cre­ dulity, for example—unless the player and GM come up with a good reason for this to happen. Maybe the Mechanic character was the sole survivor of a downed ship on a backwater planet and learned his skills from tinkering with the ship’s equipment. Of course, the player must come up with a good rea­ son regarding how the character managed to leave his isolated or primitive upbringing. Perhaps his character was brought back to civilization by an explorer or slipped on board a trade vessel that landed on his planet. ENTERING LIFE AS A MISCREANT Once a player determines his character’s former back­ ground, he should then consider what caused him to enter into the nebulous and dangerous world of Edge of the Empire. Was it because of a single, traumatic event? Was the character put into an untenable situation from which he had to flee? Figuring out the “last straw” that pushed a character into a life on the fringe is an excellent source of inspiration for both the player and the GM. Presented here are several “hooks” that describe ways in which a character moves from his former life into one of adventure and danger. OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS The simplest reason for a character to live on the fring­ es of society is the basic desire to grasp some opportu­ nity or challenge oneself. A character from a hard, poor background may strive to better himself and jumps at the first chance to improve his lot. A well-off character may be bored with the steady rhythms of high soci­ ety or realizes that his chances for advancement must come from his own hard work rather than waiting for things to occur. Lastly, this could be as simple as mak­ ing a spur of the moment decision to board a starship bound for some far-flung part of the galaxy. A HIGHER CALLING Even in the rough-and-tumble world of Edge of the Em pire, there are those who strive to change the galaxy—often for the better, but sometimes for the worse. Perhaps the character has made a vow to help others, which works nicely into the Oath Obligation. A character may receive some sort of sign that tells him to leave behind his former life and make his way to the fringes of the galaxy to serve this higher calling. ENEMIES AND ANTAGONISTS Simply put, the character rubbed someone the wrong way and found himself fleeing his former life. Even if the player decides that the enemy may not be the source of an Obligation, or may not be around any more to cause the character grief, this could be used as a hook to reintroduce the enemy later on in a campaign. A FAILURE OF CHARACTER Some inherent flaw in the character causes him to leave behind the life he knew for the unknown. This background hook ties in well with some Obligations, such as Addiction, Obsession, or Betrayal. Regardless of the cause, the character finds himself shut out from his former society, left to deal with his own problems. However, the character may view this in a positive light, seeing himself freed from the pressures of scrutiny or keeping on the move to leave trouble behind. WRONG PLACE, WRONG TIME The character finds himself embroiled in a life of ad­ venture through no fault of his own. He could have been captured by pirates, the sole survivor of a deadly plague, or even something as mundane as being unem­ ployed and forced to find some new way to bring in the credits. Regardless of the method for the character's push from society, he finds it nearly impossible to re­ turn to the way that things used to be. The character must quickly adapt to his new and dangerous situation. STEP 2: OBLIGATION O bligation plays a vital role in defining a Player Char­ acter. Defined simply, Obligation represents the debts a Player Character owes. These debts may be physical (money owed, services that must be repaid, or a binding contract) or they could be intangible (a feeling of responsibility for a friend’s well-being, the duty he feels to help his family, or a favor owed to someone else). A character’s actions can often be guided by his Obligation, and in Edge of the Em pire, Obligation is a vital aspect of a character that can have very tangible effects on his development. During character creation, players not only custom­ ize their characters by selecting skills or characteris­ tics, but also by choosing what sort of Obligation the character has. An Obligation may be a large outstand­ ing debt, the PC being blackmailed for services, owing a crime boss “favors,’’ having a price on his head, or being locked into a binding contract. Over the course of a campaign, Obligations can put pressure on characters—having unresolved Obli­ gations can affect them in very tangible ways. At the same time, taking on additional Obligations allows characters to obtain goods and services that would normally be far out of reach. This provides players with a choice: do they resolve their character’s Obli­ gation as quickly as possible, do they maintain their current level of Obligation, or do they take on even more Obligation in the hopes that the risk will pay off with larger rewards? WHAT IS OBLIGATION? Each Player Character starts with at least one Obli­ gation. As described previously, this Obligation may be a tangible one such as a debt owed or a bounty on one’s head, or an intangible Obligation such as an unpaid favor or familial duty. A player may select his character’s Obligation in one of several ways. He may roll randomly from the list found on Table 2 -1 : Obligation. Alternatively, if a particular Obligation fits his character’s backstory, he may choose one of the Obligations on Table 2 -1 in­ stead of rolling, as long as he has his CM’s permission. Finally, he may make up his own Obligation, if he has a concept that better fits his backstory. GMs should be aware, however, that some of the published adventures in supplements are tied into the Obligations listed here. Each Obligation consists of two parts: • A title and narrative description: This does not have any rules effect, but is intended to offer an explanation that allows the player to work the Obligation into his character’s story. • A numeric value: This is the Obligation’s size, and determines the mechanical effects of an Ob­ ligation. The mechanical workings of Obligations are explained starting on page 41. STARTING OBLIGATION Each character begins play with a moderate Obligation of some sort. The nature of this Obligation is determined TABLE 2-1: OBLIGATION d100 roll Obligation Type 01-08 A d d ic tio n : The character has a strong addiction he must keep feeding. Whether it's a physical addiction to stims, dust, or alcohol, or a mental addiction such as gambling, law-breaking, or priceless antiques, the character devotes a lot of time, energy, and resources to pursuing or obtaining the object of his addiction. Avoiding this Obligation has an almost immediate result—withdrawal. The exact nature depends on the addiction, but the character finds it increasingly difficult to concentrate on even mundane tasks, often reflected in the GM adding anywhere from ■ to ■ ■ ■ to skill checks. 09-16 B e tra yal: This Obligation can work in one of two ways: either the character is the target of a deep and personal betrayal, or the character is the one who betrayed others. Whether it's as simple as a betrayed confidence or broken promise or as serious as treason or mutiny, the betrayal eats away at the character and affects his everyday life. The target of the betrayal may seek answers, compensation, or simply revenge. 17-24 B la ckm a il: Someone has discovered one of the PC's dirty secrets and is using that knowledge for some sort of gain. To make matters worse, the blackmailer possesses evidence that could possibly leak out—a holovid, bank records, a weapon used during a crime, and so on. In order to keep the secret safe, the character must do what he is told, although the blackmailer is savvy enough to keep the demand simple enough to maintain the blackmail for as long as possible, generally demanding money or favors. 25-32 B o u n ty: For some reason, the character has a price on his head. This may be in the form of a legal warrant or a contract by criminals, collection agencies, or even someone who felt his honor violated in some way. What he did to earn this mark is up to his background, and the severity of his actions can be based on the size of his Obligation. 33-40 C rim ina l: The character has a criminal record, or was accused of a crime (perhaps one he didn't even commit), and is somehow embroiled in the legal system. Obligation may be settled by paying ongoing legal costs, making attempts to bury evidence, or efforts to prove his innocence. 41-48 D e b t: The character owes someone a great deal, whether that debt consists of money or something else. Perhaps the PC has a huge gambling debt to a Hutt, is indebted to the Czerka Corporation for his starship, owes a wealthy family for patronage, or has some other serious financial obligation. To make matters worse, depending on who owns the debt, even fully paying it off might not get the character completely off the hook—if the character can get that money, he can surely get more. 49-56 D u tyb o u n d : The PC has a deep sense of duty that he feels compelled to fulfill, such as military service, making good on a contract, or following some sort of thieves’ code. Unlike the Oath Obligation (see below), a Dutybound character has some legal or ritualistic bind to an organization or cause making it extremely difficult or detrimental if he fails to live up to that commitment. 57-64 Fam ily: The character has deep ties with his family that require a great deal of time and attention This could include providing care for or assistance to siblings or parents, the management of an inheritance, trust, or family business, or simply mediating between squabbling family members. 65-72 Favor: The PC owes a big favor. Perhaps officials looked the other way when he smuggled in goods, or a friend got him out of prison. Regardless, the favors are stacking up, and soon he’s going to be asked to pay them back or return the favor. This favor may be called in a little at a time, prolonging the Obligation. 73-80 O a th : The character has sworn some sort of oath that dictates his thoughts and actions, shaping his moral view of the world. This could be an oath to a deity, a way of living (such as the Jedi Code), or a willingness to sacrifice for the betterment of some group or cause. Whatever the case, the Oath should be both serious and make life difficult in some ways for the character. It is a personal and deep undertaking, possibly without a truly obtainable end goal in sight. Characters who do not live up to this oath face an internal and moral struggle. 81-88 O bsession: The PC has some unhealthy obsession that tends to interfere in his life, whether with a celebrity, a region, a political movement, a cultural icon, or some other facet of society or life. He must pursue this, possibly to the detriment of his health, finances, or well-being. A character with this Obligation tends to get along well with others that share his interest, but is looked at with pity, amusement, or even a bit of fear from others who don't understand. 89-96 R e sp o n sib ility: A character with the Responsibility Obligation feels a strong sense of accountability or relationship to a person, place, or thing (a responsibility to kin falls under the Family Obligation described above). This could include a strong connection to a mentor, a strong desire to care for orphans in a given location, or taking on the needs of an under-represented minority. 97-00 Roll twice on this chart. Starting Obligation is split into two different origins (this does not increase the Obligation's magnitude; divide the starting Obligation into two equal parts, each with a different type). TABLE 2-2: STARTING OBLIGATIONS # of PCs in the Party Recommended Default Starting Obligation per player . 2 20 3 15 4 10 5 10 6 + 5 by the player, either by rolling randomly or by selecting based on his backstory. The size of each player’s Ob­ ligation is based on the starting number of players, as determined by Table 2 -2 : Starting Obligations In addition, players may choose to increase the size of their characters' starting Obligation when they generate their Obligation, in order to gain additional starting experience, or additional credits to purchase starting gear. However, doing so puts both the individ­ ual character and the group at greater peril when the GM makes an Obligation Check at the start of a ses­ sion (see Obligation in Play on the following page). PLAYER STARTING OBLIGATION VALUES The different starting amounts in Table 2 -2 : Start­ ing Obligations are designed to have starting par­ ties begin with a total group Obligation between 40 and 60 points after taking on additional Obligation. Players who too readily dip into extra Obligation to gain more experience points or extra credits during character creation may find their group with a much higher starting value, while more cautious groups may begin with less. Each Player Character has the option to gain ad­ ditional starting Obligation in exchange for additional STARTING WITH THE SAME OBLIGATION O bligation can prove to be a great way to tie characters together. If two or more char­ acters start with the same Obligation, either because they roll it randomly or because they chose it. their players may decide that the characters don't just have the same type of Obligation, they all share the same Obligation. Perhaps they all roll Debt, and owe the same Hutt crime lord for giving them a ship. Or per­ haps they all decide to select Oath, and the players decide their characters have all sworn the same oath to accomplish a greater goal. mechanical benefits, as laid out in Table 2 -3 : Addi­ tional Obligation There are two limitations to this: each player can only choose each option once, and Player Characters cannot gain more additional Obli­ gation than their original starting value. Obligation values can fluctuate over the course of a game, as players have the chance to buy down their existing Obligations, or take on new Obligations. TABLE Z-3: ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION Additional Bonus Cost + 5 starting XP + 5 Obligation + 1 0 starting XP + 10 O bligation + 1,000 starting credits + 5 Obligation + 2 ,5 0 0 starting credits + 10 Obligation OBLIGATION IN PLAY In addition to the narrative implications, Obligation has a mechanical impact as well. Every session, the GM determines whether the group’s total Obligation affects the game. Before each session, the GM rolls percentile dice and compares the results to the group’s current out­ standing Obligation (the chart discussed in "Assem­ bling the Group’s Obligation”). OBLIGATION CHECK RESULTS If the roll is greater than the party’s total Obligation, then their Obligation is low enough that their collec­ tive tangible or intangible debts and duties are not pressing enough to affect them—at least for now. However, if the roll is equal to or less than the group’s total Obligation, something related to their Obligation may introduce complications during the upcoming ses­ sion. First, rolling equal to or lower than the group's Obligation means that all characters reduce their strain threshold by I for the remainder of the session. In addition, the GM can determine exactly whose Obligation triggered by comparing the results of his roll to the chart. If, for example, the GM rolled a 1 7, then the character with the Obligation value 16-30 would have his Obligation triggered. This Player Char­ acter reduces his strain threshold by 2 (instead of 1) for the remainder of the session. Finally, if the GM triggered an Obligation and the roll was doubles (an" 11 ” or a "4 4 ” for example), the effects of triggering that Obligation also double. All characters reduce their strain threshold by 2 for the remainder of the session, and the Player Character whose Obliga­ tion triggered reduces his strain threshold by 4. These mechanical effects represent either internal or external pressure on the Player Characters as a result of their Obligation. It could be as simple as the charac­ ters being worried about paying off their Obligations, and their concern distracting them and stressing them. However, (especially if the GM rolls doubles) triggered Obligation can also result in tangible problems. Favors could be called in, debts may require an impromptu payment, or an addiction may bring with it a sudden craving that needs to be satisfied. ASSEMBLING THE GROUP’S OBLIGATION O nce each player in the group has picked his char­ acter’s Obligation, the GM assembles all of the Obligations into a single table. If the GM is using the group sheet from the back of this book, he'll find a place to record the group’s collective Obliga­ tions. Otherwise, he can simply write them down in a table. The table should have three columns. The first is the column that contains each Obligation’s value. The second column details the type of Ob­ ligation. The third column records the character to whom each Obligation belongs. There isn't a "standard” Obligation Check C h a rt- each is unique to each group and play session, based on the characters’ individual Obligations. The GM notes each of the players' names and his character’s Obligations on a sheet of paper. The GM then creates an Obligation Check chart, as­ signing percentiles to each character and his ap­ propriate Obligations. In some cases, the group may possess an Obligation as a whole (not di­ vided amongst the characters). In this case, the group Obligation gains its own entry and listing. For example, consider a party with four Player Characters, Oskara the Twi’lek, 41 -VEX the droid, Lowhhrick the Wookiee. and Hash the human. Since there are four of them, each started with 10 Obligation (according to Table 2 -2 : Starting Obligations). Oskara’s Obligation is Duty (in this case, her duty to her clan back home), 41 -VEX’s Obligation is Debt (the cost of purchasing his own freedom), Lowhhrick’s Obligation is Oath (he’s sworn to hunt down the Trandoshan slavers who kidnapped his family) and Pash’s Obligation is Fa­ vor (he owes his old mentor for setting him up as a smuggler). In addition, Pash's player decided to start Hash with an additional + 5 Obligation to gain + 5 starting XP, for 1 5 total Obligation. The GM takes this information and assembles the following chart. O b li g a t i o n V a lu e O b li g a t i o n T y p e C h a r a c t e r 1-15 Favor Hash 16-25 Duty Oskara 26-55 Oath Lowhhrick 36-45 Debt 41-VEX Note that the GM added each Obligation onto the previous total when assembling the list. This is ex­ tremely important when using Obligation in a game session, as it allows the GM to roll a percentile dice and randomly determine if any of the Obligations come into play during that session. It also shows the GM the total Obligation of the characters. The GM should organize the Obligation list from the highest total value to the lowest total value. \ Ultimately, even though the mechanical effects always come into play, it’s up to the CM as to how this affects the characters narratively. One thing the CM should not feel obligated to do, however, is dis­ rupt his own narrative or story in order to represent a triggered Obligation. Remember, the effects of a triggered Obligation can always be mental. If a PCs "bounty" Obligation gets triggered, but the CM is in the middle of an ongoing adventure and doesn’t want to complicate things by having a bounty hunter show up, he can just tell the player that his PC is suffering a lower strain threshold because he’s worried this ad­ venture is making it harder to avoid bounty hunters. OBLIGATION AS A THRESHOLD Obligation can also be used as a threshold, a measure of the group’s infamy or social standing, depending on the volume and type of Obligation. Generally, as the characters in Edge of the Empire gain more Obligation, their ties deepen to the criminal underworld of the galaxy. Even if the Obligation itself seems innocuous, such as a Favor Obligation, the favors may be owed to someone with far more criminal links. Due to this, the CM has the option to set thresholds for the group’s total Obligation (or individual characters’ Ob­ ligations). In these cases, the CM may determine that the group’s total Obligation must either be less or more than the set threshold in order for them to attempt a certain task. For example, a local politician may not be willing to meet with a group whose Obligation is more than 60, but a local crime lord may not trust a group whose Obligation is less than 50. In both cases, it’s a matter of how the NPCs perceive the group’s overall reputation. More on Obligation thresholds is covered on page 508 in Chapter IX: The Game Master At this stage it is sufficient for players to know that the more Obligation their characters have, the easier a time they’re likely to have dealing with other criminals, and the harder a time they’re likely to have dealing with law-abiding citizens. OBLIGATION A S A RESOURCE Sometimes characters have the option to voluntarily ac­ cept additional Obligation to obtain items and accom­ plish goals that would normally be out of their reach. In these cases, the CM may increase an existing Obligation by a certain amount, or decide to create an entirely new Obligation to reflect the transaction or events. This is mainly covered on page 509 in Chapter IX: The Game Master, as these options occur later dur­ ing gameplay, and not usually during character creation. The only point players should be aware of is that not all Obligation is created equal. Obligation does not have an equivalent value in credits; its value is solely dependent on the circumstances, what is being acquired, the person or people being negotiated with, and so on. Acquiring an illegally salvaged T-45 power coupling on the black mar­ ket may require 5 Obligation from a well-known fence and underworld contact, but could require 15 Obligation from a politician who needs to pull a few strings and en­ sure he retains plausible deniability about the entire affair. EXAMPLE OBLIGATION CHECK A t the start of a session with the characters Os- kara the Twi’lek, 41-VEX the droid, Lowhhrick the Wookiee, and Hash the human, the GM takes their Obligation chart and rolls a percentile die. O b li g a t i o n V a lu e O b li g a t i o n T y p e C h a r a c t e r 1-15 Favor Hash 16-25 Duty Oskara 26-55 Oath Lowhhrick 56-45 Debt 41-VEX The CM rolls a 59. This means that the group’s Obligation has been triggered (as the GM rolled a result that was equal to or lower than their to­ tal Obligation of 45). More specifically, 41-VEX’s Obligation has been triggered, as the result was between 56 and 45. Mechanically, this means all characters suffer -1 to their strain threshold for the session, and 41- VEX suffers - 2 to his strain threshold instead. Nar­ ratively, this could just mean that 41-VEX is par­ ticularly concerned about his outstanding debts, concerned enough that the droid is complaining about them and driving the other three characters to distraction. It is not a major part of the ongo­ ing story, but is a reminder to the group that they have to handle this Obligation at some point. However, if the GM had rolled a 44, the fact that he rolled doubles means the effects amplify. In this case, Oskara, Lowhhrick, and Hash see their strain thresholds drop by 2 for the session, and 41-VEX's threshold drops by 4. In this case, the GM could decide the penalty is severe enough that something ominous has occurred, such as a skip tracer contacting 41 -VEX to demand a pay­ meant immediately, or even his creditor threat­ ening to send a bounty hunter after the poor droid—and if its friends are caught in the cross­ fire, that’s no problem to the creditor. When characters have an opportunity to pay off or commit resources to decrease their current level, this is called settling the Obligation. Settling can occur in several ways. In most cases, the Obligation settlement will either be specific or generic. SPECIFIC SETTLEMENT Depending on whose Obligation came into play, or the form the resources have come in, the settlement may be specifically tied to one character's Obligation. For example, if 41 -VEX’s Debt Obligation is triggered for the session, and 41 -VEX is indebted to a Hutt drug lord, then the cache of illegal spice they uncover is es­ sentially earmarked to help settle 41 -VEX’s debt. GENERIC SETTLEMENT In other cases, the party simply has additional re­ sources that they can spend to help settle their current outstanding Obligations. Whether this is in the form of cash (they receive 20,000 credits for their last job) or some other asset, they find themselves with a few weeks to spare between missions—the CM may allow them to apply these assets to help settle one or more of their Obligations. The CM decides how much Obli­ gation the resources will settle, and the players decide how best to divide this among their Obligations. S E T T L IN G O B L IG A T IO N O bligation generally ranges from 5 to 100. No matter how much the PCs pay off, return favors, or try to live squeaky clean. Obligation cannot be reduced lower than 5. While 100 is the top practical range when rolling percentiles, Obligation can exceed 100. In this case, sim­ ply track Obligation as normal. Exceeding 100 means Obligation triggers every session, and has an additional detrimental effect on charac­ ters, which is covered below. EXCEEDING 100 OBLIGATION O nce the party's Obligation exceeds 100, the pressure of their Obligations is so severe that they can focus on little else until that Ob­ ligation is back under control. Until the party brings its total Obligation back under 100, none of the Player Characters can spend expe­ rience points to improve abilities, train skills, or acquire talents. The PCs simply have too much on their minds, and are fraught with too much mistrust, anxiety, and strain to focus long enough to improve themselves. OBLIGATION CAP STEP 3: SELECTING A SPECIES I n Edge of the Em pire, players have a wide variety of options to choose from when choosing a species to play. The billions of worlds of the Star Wars gal­ axy confer nearly unlimited possibilities. The diverse crowd in the Mos Eisley Cantina scene in Star Wars-. Episode IV 4 New Hope offers but a glimpse at the sapient creatures who inhabit this faraway universe. This section provides detailed rules for eight major species types, though this should not dissuade players from choosing species not listed here. Star Wars is not Star Wars without its aliens. Players should be able to encounter new life forms in their adventures and also have the opportunity to roleplay them. The very nature of the fringe is to break boundaries and find new pos­ sibilities—the only limitation is imagination. CHOOSING A SPECIES A player must choose a species for his character, even before he commits to a career. The choice of species and career can go hand-in-hand and stress a charac­ ter’s background story above all else. Each species has idiosyncratic abilities and character­ istics that influence the next stage of character creation, the picking of careers. Species selection determines the initial ratings of characteristics, like Brawn and Cunning, and starting experience points (XP). Players use the al­ lotment of XP for modification of characteristics or for the acquisition of new skills and talents appropriate to their character’s background and their career. Remember, a wide range of characteristic distribu­ tions can be created by spending starting XP, so do not feel forced to choose a specific species for its characteristics. In addition, the characteristics of a character do not define him completely. Good role- playing and storytelling do more to create a charac­ ter than numbers ever do. BOTHANS Bothans are the galaxy’s information brokers. Adept at picking up on secrets or seeing things other spe­ cies ignore, Bothans can be valuable assets in any endeavor—or untrustworthy partners. Physiology: Bothans have highly attuned senses which aid in gathering and relaying information. The noses at the end of their tapered snouts can distinguish many smells, and their eyes have an extended range of focus. They possess ears double the size of most species and can rotate and bend them to pick up directional sounds. Standing on average 1.6 meters, their small size allows Bothans to often go unnoticed and slip through cracks that would never fit a human. Their greatest asset is their fur. They can communicate with other Bothans by rippling their fur, demonstrating changes in mood and conveying more specific intimations in a code. Society: Every layer of Bothan society is based on the acquisition, manipulation, and utilization of knowledge. Sometimes likened to the Hutts and Twi’leks, Bothans take such comparisons as an insult. Prestige, not wealth, motivates them. A Bothan’s reputation is, at the end of the day, all he has. The Bothan Council governs the Bo­ than worlds. The major clans all have one representa­ tive in the Council, which then elects the Council Chief. Bothans shun outright confrontation. Information is their weapon, and Bothans play secrets like a Corellian plays sabacc. the truth is the ace up their sleeve. The Bothans operate the most elaborate and ex­ tensive intelligence network across the galaxy. This “spynet" works through moles, provocateurs, sleep­ ers, and drop-offs which transfer information down a clandestine web to the Bothan spymasters. Though the spynet hubs on Bothawui are Bothan-run, the ma­ jority of its “placed” agents are foreign species. Homeworld: Bothans hail from Bothawui, a temper­ ate world in the Mid Rim. They have also established major colonies on Kothlis and Torolis. Language: Bothese is the native tongue of the Bo- thans and Botha is its written form. Almost all Bo- thans are fully fluent in Basic. Wrendui, which in Both­ ese means the nonverbal cues and emotions a Bothan can communicate through his fur, has many coded forms that a spectator can translate into explicit in­ formation if the cipher is known. Well-trained Bothan spies can switch between different forms of wrendui in a single ripple of their fur. Life on the Fringe: Bothans gravitate towards profes­ sions in which information is king. They make strong Traders, Scouts, Thieves, and Politicos. They will at­ tempt to ascend the chain of command of their current career and will also funnel knowledge to the Bothan Spy Network to help their clan back on Bothawui. SPECIES ABILITIES • Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 11 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 100 XP • Special Ability: Bothans begin the game with one rank in Streetwise. They still may not train Street­ wise above rank 2 during character creation. They also start with one rank in the Convincing Demean­ or talent. USING LANGUAGES IN EDGE OF THE EMPIRE L anguage has always been a vital scene-setting tool in Star Wars. The animalistic roars of a Wookiee, the bird-like twittering of an astromech droid, or the guttural rumblings of a Hutt crime lord serve as reminders that the Star Wars uni­ verse is a vast place with countless species and cultures. For this reason, nearly every species in Edge of the Empire has its own language, and in the case of wildly diverse species like humans, they may actually have many different languages based on the planet or culture they hail from. While all these varied languages exist, they are not intended to provide a barrier to understanding and comprehension. Star Wars has a wide variety of tools for language interpretation, from protocol droids that are fluent in over six million forms of communication to the simple fact that most galac­ tic citizens utilize the pan-galactic language known as Basic, which nearly everyone understands even if they are unable to speak it. Each species entry lists the languages unique to that species. However, all Player Character species are able to understand Basic, even if they are un­ able to vocalize it (such as in the case of Wookiees and some Gand variants). However, Player Charac­ ters are not required to track the different languag­ es they speak. Every Player Character in a group is considered to be fluent in any language spoken by another group member (so that the lone Wookiee isn’t left mute because nobody speaks Shyriiwook), In addition, the CM should endeavor to make com­ prehensible any individuals the PCs encounter dur­ ing their adventure, by whatever means the GM deems appropriate. For example, one of the PCs may speak the individual’s language, or vice-versa. There may be a protocol droid available, or perhaps everyone involved speaks Basic. The one exception to this should be if the lack of comprehension is itself a major plot point; otherwise the issue of lan­ gauge should never hamper the ongoing story. DROIDS A typical fringer may ridicule his droid to no end, yet without it, he is usually lost. Droids serve a variety of roles on the fringe, including security and conflict reso­ lution, surgery and medicine, mechanical repairs, con­ struction, astrogation and piloting, and mechanical la­ bor. While many of these droids have only rudimentary intelligence, some are capable of independent thought. PLAYING A DROID Creating droid characters in Edge of the Empire is easy. Treat them as a separate species, with bonuses and abilities that reinforce their robotic natures. Play­ ers should be creative when coming up with their de­ scription, and also with how the droid uses its equip­ meant. Instead of a droid wearing Laminate Armor, for example, it could have reinforced metal plates at­ tached directly to its chassis, and instead of carrying a blaster pistol, it could have one built into its arm. The personality of a droid is a more delicate mat­ ter. The very fact that the droid is a Player Character means that it is self-aware and independent-minded (unless the player wants to play a character who is completely subservient to the surrounding biologi- cals, of course). Players who want to make a droid character should remember the droid’s origins and try to incorporate elements of their original function into their personality, even if their droid character has taken on roles far beyond what he was originally pro­ grammed for. A traffic control droid, for example, may take up the career of a mechanic, but still grumble endlessly whenever his pilot colleague breaks local flight and traffic laws. Physical Description: Droids are assembled in many different body types, from chassis that follow bipedal standards, to those of various animals, to completely utilitarian boxes or cylinders. VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL MODELS Droids can be either fresh off the assembly line with standard physical and mechanical specifications, or be customized units that fit their owner’s tastes. • 2-1 B Surgical Droid (Genetech/lndustrial Au­ tomaton): The 2-1 B Surgical Droid is a highly intel­ ligent and flexible thinker; as one would expect of a droid whose decisions involve life and death. Its rather ugly chassis hides a remarkably complex and flexible behavioral circuitry matrix, and the droids are intelligent and capable in equal measure. • 3P0 Protocol Droids (Cybot Galactica): The 3P0 series of protocol droids are some of the most human-like automata ever developed—perfect for their assigned tasks as ambassadors, political aids, translators, and personal attaches. However, their advanced SyntheTech AA-1 verbobrains can some­ times develop neuroses or other “quirks." • IG Assassin Droids (Holowan Mechanicals): Culminating with the feared and deadly IG-88 DROIDS AND LIFE T he two factors that determine intelligent life, sentience (the ability to sense) and sapience (the wisdom that comes from self-awareness) are not qualities many ascribe to droids. Droids are built to feel neither pain nor emotion. However they function with a high intelligence that sur­ passes most biochemical minds, and over the years without a memory wipe, personality quirks and self-preservation often overshadow the droid’s original programing. Does this mean that droids can develop sentience and sapience over a period of time? It is a question that remains without a universally accepted answer. model, the 1C series is infamous as one of the most lethal assassin droids in the galaxy. IG droids rarely meet an opponent they cannot eliminate, and true to their humorless nature, they follow the instruc­ tions for a particular bounty to the letter. • LE-VO Law Enforcement Droids (Rseikharhl Droid Group): The success of LE-VOs in deter­ ring crime in the Rseikharhl sector has led to their adoption galaxy-wide as appropriate models for police assistance and private security. Their pro­ gramming requires them to follow Imperial codes to the letter and only use force when absolutely necessary. Though they are hardly ever equipped with lethal weaponry, they know how to target a stun weapon for maximum effect. • LOM Protocol Droid (Industrial Automaton): The LOM series was Industrial Automaton’s at­ tempt to upset a market dominated by Cybot Calactica. IA attempted to make a protocol droid very similar to the 3P0 units but with an insectoid head to appeal to niche markets. However, bad PR from at least one unit’s career as a jewel thief caused IA to scrap the line. Some of the remain­ ing LOM droids do have a habit of developing in­ teresting and unexpected personalities. • R-Series Astromech Droids (Industrial Automa­ ton): The wildly successful R-series ranges from the original and cumbersome R1 to the famous R2 unit and all the way to the soon-to-be-released R6. Aside from the R1 (which is more than two meters tall and works aboard capital ships), all of the R-se­ ries astromechs are roughly a meter or so tall, and designed to ride in sockets aboard snubfighters to perform astrogation calculations and allow hyper­ space jumps. A wide variety of tools also make them decent repair droids. Society: Smugglers have long traded rumors of "droid worlds,” where automatons and cyborgs govern a so­ ciety of their own. Aside from such tall tales, droids do not have their own society, instead laboring within the society of their human and non-human masters. Un­ less a droid’s personality has reprogrammed its cogni­ tive faculties, droids are built to obey, and they do. However, the droids played by PCs present a spe­ cial case. Over the millennia there have been count­ less examples of droids that have transcended their original programming to become self-aware and self operating. Some of these automata last for hundreds of years, repairing and upgrading themselves to re­ main at peak efficiency. Some of these droids take pride and satisfaction in continuing to do the jobs they were designed for as well as possible, such as an R2 unit that constantly works to become a better pilot and astrogator. Oth­ ers break with their programming entirely and choose new enterprises to pursue. The infamous 4-LOM started out life as a protocol droid, before becoming a jewel thief and eventually one of the galaxy’s most well-known bounty hunters. Life on the Fringe: Droids from all classes operate with smugglers and criminal groups in the Outer Rim, where there are those who are willing to overlook their mechanical nature and respect a fellow fringer with a valuable skill set. Some bear their original design with­ out modification, while other units are cleverly disguised in other bodies, such as the Cybot Galactica protocol DRDID CLASSIFICATIONS D roids manufacturers organize droids in five dis­ tinct classes based on their primary functions. Class One (First-degree): Specializing in physical sciences, mathematics, and medicine, these droids are often highly intelligent intel­ lectuals, but lacking in "common sense.” Class Two (Second-degree): Class Twos work in the engineering and technical fields such as re­ pairs and astrogation. They are often well-liked due to their reasonable intelligence, non-threat­ ening appearances, and quirky personalities. Class Three (Third-degree): Class Three droids are often humanoid in appearance, as they are intended to work directly with organ­ ics. They are programmed for the social and service areas, such as interpretation, teaching, protocol, and diplomatic assistance. Class Four (Fourth-degree): Class Fours are equipped with weaponry and designed for se­ curity, military training and operations, gladi­ atorial combat, and even assassination. Class Five (Fifth-degree): Class Fives are sim­ ple labor units for a whole host of menial jobs, from sanitation to load-lifting. Many do not have enough cognition to be considered sentient. series. And there are a handful of droids like the pirate lord ZI-ZO who have taken business into their own hands, finding it more efficient to lead than serve. SPECIES ABILITIES • Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 10 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 1 75 XP • Special Abilities: Droids do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and are unaffected by toxins or poisons. Droids have a cybernetic implant cap of 6 instead of their Brawn rating. In addition, after selecting their career, a Droid Player Character may train one rank in six of the eight career skills (instead of the usual four). After selecting their first specialization, a Droid Player Character may train one rank in three of the four specialization skills (instead of the usual two). • Inorganic: Since droids are inorganic, they do not gain the benefits of recovering with a bacta tank, stimpack, or Medicine skill checks. Droids do recover naturally by resting, as their systems attempt self-repairs. Otherwise, droids need to be tended to with a Mechanics check, using the same difficulties and results of Medicine checks for organic beings. Emergency repair patches can be used to repair damage just like stimpacks are used on organic beings. See page 220 for more on droid repairs and healing. Due to their resilient metallic construction, droids start the game with one rank in the Enduring talent. • Mechanical Being: Droids cannot become Force sensitive, nor acquire a Force Rating by any means. Droids cannot use Force powers, and also cannot be affected by mind-altering Force powers. DROIDS AND EQUIPMENT D roids do not typically wear clothing, and many items of equipment that organics would have to carry separately may actually be part of a droid’s body. For this reason, droids are allowed to treat certain pieces of equip­ meant differently than other characters. For ex­ ample, if a droid purchases and wears armor, the player can simply say his character has upgraded armor plates on his body, or a rein­ forced outer covering. Likewise, he could have an upgraded verbobrain instead of a datapad, or an internal communications device instead of a comlink (although many droids do carry equipment such as datapads and comlinks). GANDS Cands are a mysterious insectoid species whose "findsmen" treat tracking quarry as a religious duty. They are exceptionally good at divining the location of individuals through ritualistic methods that off- worlders might consider backward and barbaric. Physiology: Though prevalent in the fringes of the Outer Rim, Gands remain a puzzle to xenobiologists. Over a dozen distinct subspecies of the Gands have been reported. All are covered in a dense chitinous exoskeleton and reach a height at adulthood of about 1.6 meters. They have three fingers on each hand, which are as dextrous as those of other humanoids, allowing them to manipulate equipment designed for five-fingered individuals. Where Gands subspecies differ from one another is in their respiratory biology. Most Gands who travel the spacelanes do not seem to need to breathe at all. The digestion of food in their stomachs produces the ammo­ nia necessary for their biochemistry. Wasteful byproducts and extraneous ammonia are expelled through their exo­ skeletons. These Gands often emanate an unpleasant methane musk. Other Gand subspecies possess actual lungs and cannot produce ammonia through digestion, instead requiring a special breathing apparatus. Questions about Gand biology continue to go unan­ swered, since the Gand refuse to permit other species to study them. Some xenobiologists conjecture that Gand religious rituals dictate genetic manipulation, which has produced many different varieties of Gands. Society: Gands have a closed culture. What is known about them is that religion and life are closely en­ twined. A gathering of elders called the Ruetsavii observes the various religious sects that represent the virtues of Gand life. Off-worlders are most famil­ iar with the religious sect known as the "findsmen.” These are the Gand who leave their home planet on ritualistic hunts to catch prey and bring divine bless­ ings to their people. Many other sects are rumored to exist, particularly in the fields of genetics, medicine, and engineering, but their exact natures are unknown. Homeworld: Sharing the same name as its species, Gand is an Outer Rim world clouded in ammonia and methane. Trade is handled through orbiting stations as foreigners are rarely allowed on the planet’s sur­ face. Those non-Gand who land on the world must stay in the specially equipped Alien Quarters. Language: Droids fare much better than well-trained humanoid linguists in reproducing the clicks and chir­ rups of the Gand spoken language. Without the need to intake breathable gases, most Gand lack the vocal cords to make the sounds of Basic and other languag­ es. They must use droids or translation devices to con­ verse in groups that do not understand their language. FINDSMEN G and findsmen have become legends in the galaxy for their talents at tracking and hunt­ ing targets. Findsmen invoke mystical mantras and look for omens in the most ordinary of places—pools of fuel, transparisteel smudges, the patterns of circuitry—to divine the location and the intention of the one they seek. These religious rituals findsmen call “the path to truth" appear bizarre to non-Cand, but no one will dispute a Cand findsman's end result. The grammar that Cand use reflects their place in society. Before a Cand earns his identity and is ac­ cepted among his peers, he refers to himself in the third person, calling himself “Cand.” Once he has done a deed of distinction, a Cand may take his fam­ ily name. Cand cannot use their first names until they have become “persons of greatness”—janwuine in their own tongue—and received commendations from their peers. This causes many off-worlders to view the Gand as a people of extreme humility. Life on the Fringe: Since Gand findsmen have such a high success rate of catching targets, employers are perfectly willing to ignore cultural mysteries and odd smells. Cand findsmen are in constant demand as bounty hunters, private investigators, assassins, skip tracers, and security advisers. SPECIES ABILITIES HUMANS Humans are the most populous and gregarious of the galaxy’s sapient species. They seem to be present on almost every open planet that harbors life while trav­ eling the spacelanes looking for more. Physiology: Humans are mammalian bipeds with mostly hairless skin. Their skin tones encompass a gamut of colors, from peachy tones to dark brown and black. Males average 1.8 meters tall, while fe­ males stand shorter and are generally not as stocky. They process oxygen for respiration and can digest a variety of animal and vegetable matter. Their biol­ ogy is well-suited to many environments in the galaxy, which perhaps explains their dominance and ubiquity. Society: Human ambition and competition have split their species into many different societies. Across the galaxy, humans live under every political system ever devised, from feudalism and theocracy to democracy and autocracy, with human technology encompassing a similarly wide variation. Homeworld: Humans are thought to have arisen some­ where in the Core Worlds, perhaps on Coruscant itself. However, humans took to the stars so long ago (perhaps even before the invention of faster-than-light travel) that now, humans claim countless planets as their homes. Language: The main language that connects "base­ line" humans is Basic, though each society has its own dialect and sometimes even sub-language. Life on the Fringe: Humans can be found in almost every role and working every job on the Fringe. SPECIES ABILITIES • Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 10 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 100 XP • Special Abilities: Gands begin the game with one rank in Discipline. They still may not train Dis­ cipline above rank 2 during character creation. • Ammonia Breathers: One notable difference be­ tween the two main sub-species of Gand is that one has lungs and one does not. Those that have lungs breathe an ammonia gas mixture. Those without lungs do not respire and gain all necessary metabol­ ic substances through food. When playing a Gand, each player chooses whether he wishes his charac­ ter to have lungs or not. If he selects to be playing a lungless Cand, his character is immune to suffo­ cation (but not the wounds suffered from being ex­ posed to vacuum). If he chooses to play a Cand with lungs, he starts the game with an ammonia respira­ tor, and treats oxygen as a dangerous atmosphere with Rating 8. However, he gains + 10 starting XP. • Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 10 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 110 XP • Special Abilities: Humans start the game with one rank in two different non-career skills of their choice. They still may not train these skills above rank 2 at character creation. HUMANITY DURING THE EMPIRE I n the Empire, humans control all the levers of power in the galaxy—military, economic, and political. Anti-alien prejudice is also at its height, and the Empire actively discriminates against non-humans. However, not all humans have been brainwashed by anti-alien propagan­ da. Many show acts of kindness every day, and still others have taken up arms with their non­ human brothers and sisters to resist the Empire. RODIANS Rodians are born to hunt, coming from a hostile world that breeds killer instincts. For those with a price on their heads, a glimpse of a tapered green snout or an unmistakably putrid odor means a Rodian bounty hunter is on their tail. Physiology: Rodians evolved from climbing lizards and retain some of their ancestor’s characteristics, particularly the large eyes and climbing suction cups on their fingers and toes. Nowadays, these physical features cannot hold an adult Rodian of 1.6 meters to a rock or tree for very long, but they have saved many Rodians from falls that would kill most other species. Society: The history of Rodia is a history of violence. Long ago, the tropical world teemed with vicious preda­ tors, necessitating that the Rodians' defenseless ances­ tors either adapt or die. Adapt they did, hiding in the boughs of trees or climbing high into mountain caves, where they fashioned tools and formulated plans to hunt down the predators. Their skills in the hunt grew quickly, and soon became the central focus of their society. Rodians became so proficient at hunting that they gradually forced most of Rodia's other predators into extinction. With nothing much left to hunt, they turned on each other. Gladiatorial hunts between champions morphed into skirmishes and eventually tribal wars. Rodia was almost blockaded when first discovered by Old Republic scouts due to the warlike Rodian culture. However, Rodian leadership was able to suppress their culture’s violent tendencies long enough to make con­ tact with the rest of the galaxy. Now, millennia later, Ro­ dian culture has moved beyond the worst of its violent impulses; although, hunting is still a venerated tradition. RDDIAN DRAMA A few centuries before the Republic scouts landed on Rodia, Rodians had nearly hunted themselves to extinction. In an effort to save his people. Grand Protector Harido Kavila wrote the first Rodian play, claiming he was inspired by the gods. The play was a simple, violent, and bloody dramatic re-enactment of a Rodian hunt. Never­ theless, this drama so amused the Rodians that it channeled their focus from killing each other into performing legendary hunts of the past. Gradually, other writers began to tackle more than the spectacle of violence. They examined the cores of their characters, the fears and long­ ings of a hunter along with his melancholies and passions. Rodian drama dealt with these themes in such a visceral and emotional way that soon after Rodians entered the galactic community, their native drama took theaters by storm. BAD BLOOD I n the eyes of the Trandoshans, their feud with the Wookiees began when the Wookiees brutally killed the members of a peaceful Trandoshan scout­ ing mission on Kashyyyk. The Wookiees’ savagery caused the Trandoshans to believe the Wookiees were non-sapient barbarians and therefore had no resource rights to the planet. For added protection on their next mission, the Trandoshans brought a well-armed military force. Nonetheless, in the in­ tervening years since the Trandoshans’ first land­ ing, the Wookiees had managed to decipher the engineering of the Trandoshans’ scout vessel. After months of bloody conflict during which the Tran­ doshans served their goddess with distinction, the Wookiees overpowered the Trandoshans by sheer numbers. Further peaceful colonial missions by the Trandoshans met the same end. The Trandoshans appealed to the Old Republic, but discovered that the Wookiees had already en­ countered the off-worlders and told their lies to the Senate. Soon it was the Wookiees who rep­ Homeworld: The world of Rodia in the Mid Rim is the Rodians’ planet of origin. It merges urban and indus­ trial development with tracts of untouched rainforest, providing brave Rodian youths with environments in which to test their hunting skills. Language: Because of the structure of their mouths, Rodians have a difficult time speaking Basic and some choose not to even try, relying exclusively on their na­ tive tongue, Rodese. Life on the Fringe: The cultural heritage of “the hunt" draws Rodians into bounty hunting or employ­ meant as gunmen. Rodians often take challenges too big for them, dreaming of the prizes they will receive on Rodia for nabbing the catch. SPECIES ABILITIES • Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 10 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 100 XP • Special Abilities: Rodians begin the game with one rank in Survival. They still may not train Sur­ vival above rank 2 during character creation. Rodi­ ans start with one rank in the Expert Tracker talent. resented the Hsskassi system in the Senate, with no Trandoshan representatives. The Trandoshans felt isolated and had no recourse but war. The Re­ public eventually sent peacekeeping troops. Chancellor Palpatine finally listened to the des­ perate pleas of the Trandoshans. Dignitaries convinced him to give them representation for the Hsskassi system in the Imperial Senate in return for helping quash the Wookiee rebellion on Kashyyyk, Moreover, the Trandoshan dignitar­ ies promised to catch and deliver Wookiee slaves to the Empire. With Kashyyyk occupied by the Imperial military, the Trandoshans had at last gained the upper hand over their neighbors. Not all Trandoshans agreed with this new ap­ proach. The Trandoshan Jedi Master Krassk M ’ikosh, having tried for years to negotiate a peaceful settlement between the Wookiees and his own beloved people, died while protecting a Wookiee child against Trandoshan slavers. TRANDOSHANS Trandoshans are belligerent, lizard-like humanoids who have an avowed hatred of Wookiees. They can be found wherever a strong hand or a big gun is desired. Physiology: Standing on average a little shorter than their Wookiee nemeses, the cold blooded Tran­ doshans' three-fingered hands lack the manual dex­ terity of a thumb, causing them difficulty manipulat­ ing technology. Making up for this clumsiness are the three enormous claws on each hand. Their supersen­ sitive vision allows them to see the infrared spectrum. At younger ages, their regenerative powers are capa­ ble of restoring whole limbs if need be. Their scales range from bright green to orange, and can change in the molting season. Society: Trandoshans, who call themselves the "T'doshok” in Dosh, come from a society that empha­ sizes strength, skill at hunting, resilience, and self-re­ liance. Clutches of four eggs are raised by the mother (the father seldom has any involvement); young Tran­ doshans can walk and possess an instinctual hunting ability almost from birth. By two years of age, their mother takes them on their first hunts, and by ten they are largely self-sufficient. Trandoshan society revolves around two things: the hunt, and worship of a goddess known as the Scorekeep- er. She watches over the Trandoshan people, blessing or punishing them based on the success of their hunts. For each successful hunt and quarry brought to ground, the Trandoshans receive jagannath, “divine marks,” that show a Trandoshan’s status in society when tallied. As a Trandoshan gains jagannath, he also gains favor with the goddess. When a Trandoshan dies, he bows before the Scorekeeper and presents his jagannath quiver. That final tally of jagannath decides his place in the afterlife. As Trandoshan society has evolved in the galactic community, the importance of the hunt has merged with other societal pursuits as well. Now, a Trandoshan doctor may “hunt" for a cure against a virulent dis­ ease threatening his people, or a Trandoshan engineer may “hunt” for better starship designs or more potent weaponry. In fact, almost any action that betters the Trandoshan people can be justified as a worthy “hunt" in the eyes of Trandoshan culture. Of course, this leaves little room for “frivolous” pursuits such as the arts. Homeworld: Most Trandoshans call their home planet Hsskor, though outlanders know it as Trandosha or 'Do­ sha. Trandosha shares the same star as the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Trandoshans also colonized Trandosha's forest moon Wasskah. Language: The Trandoshan language, Dosh, sounds to the human ear like hisses and snarls. Trandoshans can learn and converse in Basic, though most of the words they speak carry a heavy sibilance. Life on the Fringe: Trandoshans constantly dream of succeeding in the hunt and receiving the Scorekeep- er's blessing with jagannath. Military, goal-oriented professions like bounty hunting and mercenary work are well suited to a Trandoshan’s hunter’s instincts. SPECIES ABILITIES TWI'LEKS The Twi’leks are among the most prominent non-hu­ man species in the galaxy. They are expert bargain­ ers, sly at reading other species and using cunning to get what they want. Physiology: Twi'leks possess two prehensile tentacles, their tchun-tchin, or lekku, that project from the back of their heads. These “head-tails" serve as a second tongue by which they can communicate through signs and gestures. The rainbow of flesh tones found among the Twi’leks are indicators of clan and region of ancestry. Society: Family is everything in Twi’lek society. The gov­ ernment on Ryloth is an alliance of “head clans," each of which control a small town or larger districts in the city. A family’s five most important Twi’leks lead their respected head-clans, with the power of influence radiating down the bloodline. According to tradition, when one leader of the head clan dies, the four remaining members must take exile in the sun-baked Bright Lands where the vi­ cious lyleks roam. In practice, however, clan leaders find new and cunning ways to subvert exile. The clan system has stratified Twi’lek society into castes. Twi’leks at the bottom of a bloodline are con­ sidered of the low birth caste and used as chattel in the slave trade. Twi’lek leaders exhibit disgust at any accusation of slavery and deny that they would ever put their own people in bondage, shifting the blame to other clans. Nonetheless, nearly every clan engages in “contracted indenturehood.” • Wound Threshold: 1 2 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 9 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 90 XP • Special Abilities: Trandoshans begin the game with one rank in Perception. They still may not train Perception above rank 2 during character creation. • Regeneration: Whenever a Trandoshan would re­ cover one or more wounds from natural rest or recu­ peration in a Bacta tank, he recovers one additional wound. He does not recover one additional wound when receiving first aid or medical treatment from a character, or when using a stimpack. Trandoshans can regrow lost limbs as well, though it usually takes at least a month before the limb is usable. • Claws: When a Trandoshan makes Brawl checks to deal damage to an opponent, he deals +1 damage and has a Critical Rating of 3. TWI'LEK ENTERTAINERS T wi’lek dance is regarded as one the galaxy’s most graceful and sensual art forms. Unfor­ tunately, it has also led to many Twi’leks (es­ pecially females) being sold as slave dancers. However, some famous Twi’lek warriors and scoundrels alike started their life as slaves be­ fore clawing their way into fame and glory. Homeworld: Though their home planet of Ryloth is located in the Outer Rim, Twi’leks can be found on many worlds throughout the galaxy, due to their en­ terprising nature and the effects of slavery. Language: Ryl is the native tongue of Ryloth, yet there are few Twi’leks who cannot speak Basic fluently. What separates Twi’leks from other species is their second, nonverbal language called Lekku, or “Twi’leki." In every­ day conversation, Twi’leks add texture and emphasis to their speech by moving and twitching their head-tails. If privacy is necessary, Twi’leks can converse in complete silence, using only the gestures of their head-tails to pass on complicated information. Life on the Fringe: Given their linguistic talents, nat­ ural cunning, and social aptitude, Twi’leks fit well into managerial, political, and leadership positions. Lesser clan members unhappy with their status often leave Ryloth to strike out on their own, driven with an entre­ preneurial spirit to start their own businesses—or run their own crime syndicates. SPECIES ABILITIES • Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 11 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 100 XP • Special Abilities: Twi’leks begin the game with one rank in either Charm or Deception. They still may not train Charm or Deception above rank 2 during character creation. When making skill checks, Twi'leks may remove ■ imposed due to arid or hot environmental conditions. WOOKIEES Strong, intelligent, and fierce in battle, Wookiees make the best of friends for those to whom they are loyal—and the worst of enemies for anyone to whom they are not. Unfortunately, Wookiees have virtually disappeared from the population at large and are be­ coming a faded memory of the Old Republic. Physiology: Averaging over two meters in height, Wookiees strike fear into the hearts of their op­ ponents because of their sheer size. There is good reason to be scared; few other species in the galaxy match either the strength of a Wookiee or the depths of a Wookiee’s temper. Their limbs are long, with re­ tractable claws on their fingers and toes for the ar­ boreal environment of their homeworld. These claws are only used for climbing, never for combat, as such an act is seen as dishonorable in Wookiee culture. Their fur grows in a variety of colors, becoming darker in middle age and then graying or whitening in later years (Wookiees can live for centuries). Society: Although their physique makes for an intimi­ dating appearance, Wookiees live by strict codes of honor and loyalty. Friendship and family bonds knit Wookiees tightly together, for there are dangers on Kashyyyk that frighten even the most ferocious Wook­ iee. Kilometers-tall wroshyr trees cover nearly half of Kashyyyk’s surface, defining the world’s unique ecol­ ogy and serving as homes for most Wookiee commu­ nities. On the seventh level of these forests, Wookiees have built immense cities in the trees, blending tech­ nology in harmony with the environment. Mechanical skills and engineering come naturally to the Wookiees. Having dominated much of Kashyyyk’s upper lev­ els, the Wookiees were on the path to explore the stars on their own when a neighboring species, the Trandoshans, arrived on Kashyyyk to colonize and exploit the world. Even though the Trandoshans had more advanced weaponry, the Wookiees fought the would-be colonizers off the planet. The Wookiees wasted no time in disassembling the technology Tran­ doshans left behind. This included a starship with sublight engines. When the Trandoshans returned, the Wookiees drove them away for a second time, then took flight to the stars. The Wookiee-Trandoshan wars continued in spats throughout the later years of the Old Republic, with the Republic mediators usually siding with the honor­ able Wookiees. The Trandoshans saw an opportunity, however, when Palpatine declared his Empire. They sent emissaries to Palpatine to recount their griev­ ances against the Wookiees. The Imperials heeded Trandoshan advice and placed the cantankerous Wookiees in labor camps. Wookiee children were held at gunpoint unless Wookiee adults used their techni­ cal expertise to build Imperial war material, which in­ cluded parts of the Death Stars. LIFE DEBTS llh e n Wookiees pledge their protection to W a n individual, they honor that pledge un­ til death. These pledges usually incorporate a Wookiee’s immediate family, but can include friends and compatriots who have done ex­ traordinary acts for the Wookiee, such as save­ ing his life or the lives of his family members. When such an act is performed, a Wookiee’s honor code places the Wookiee in a "life debt,’’ which means that nothing can repay the Wook­ iee’s friend for his act except the giving of the Wookiee’s own life. Homeworld: Wookiees hail from the forest world of Kashyyyk. This world is dominated by immense old-growth forests, including the kilometers-tall wroshyr trees. These trees form a layered ecology on Kashyyyk, with the uppermost levels being the safest. The deeper one travels into the Kashyyyk forests, the more dangerous flora and fauna one finds. At the lowest depths, even a Wookiee cannot survive for long. Language: Shyriiwook, the Wookiee tongue, contin­ ues to amaze scholars with the incredible nuances of grunts and growls that form the language. Few non-Wookiees can speak it or its dialects, like Xac- zik, spoken by the Wookiees of the Wartaki Islands. Conversely, Wookiee physiology prevents them from speaking the languages of other species, including Basic, though most Wookiees have no problem com­ prehending them. Life on the Fringe: A free Wookiee in the Impe­ rial era is usually a Wookiee with a bounty on his head. Few will bother to bring that point up, knowing it better to please a Wookiee than anger him. Those Wookiees who do not slave away in the Empire's labor camps can be found in all careers that mix danger, technology, and exploration. Bounty hunt­ ing is one profession that Wookiees find detestable, though a couple of rogues, such as Snoova, have taken that route. SPECIES ABILITIES • Wound Threshold: 14 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 8 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 90 XP • Special Abilities: Wookiees begin the game with one rank in Brawl. They still may not train Brawl above rank 2 during character creation. • Wookiee Rage: When a Wookiee has suffered any wounds, he deals + 1 damage to Brawl and Melee attacks. When a Wookiee is Critically Injured, he in­ stead deals + 2 damage to Brawl and Melee attacks. STEP 4 AND 5: CHOOSING A CAREER AND SPECIALIZATIONS f l t this stage, the player chooses his character’s ca­ reer (which remains with the PC permanently) and his starting specialization (which may be only one of many the character undertakes over the course of his story). Both are critical choices as they establish the history and the potential future of the character. It is a good idea for each player to look over all of the options before deciding. The idea is not only to look at the immediate capabilities of a character, but to look forward to that character’s growth potential. If a player imagines his PC will one day fly a small freighter into certain doom in a desperate battle for the galaxy, it’s a very good idea to make sure good piloting options are along the chosen development path. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? The most important difference between a career and a specialization is the obvious one—specializations are areas of particular focus for an individual following a career path. For purposes of story and roleplaying, however, it is important to more deeply consider the distinctions of these two character elements. What a player chooses as a career for his character defines the overall and on­ going commitment to a way of life for that character. A career is more than just what a character does for a liv­ ing—it is his way of life, encompassing his goals, his pas­ sions, his training, and his destiny. Areas of focus may change over time, and what he does to make ends meet may alter drastically over time, but a character will never truly stop being whatever it is he chose to be at his core. In other words, no matter how much he gets caught up in politics, military campaigns, or rescue missions, Flan Solo will always be a Smuggler. Specializations, on the other hand, represent a char­ acter’s areas of interest and education, his current topic of intense focus, or the vocation he’s undertaken at this stage of his life. Where a career expresses the nature of a character, a specialization indicates what a character really does in the galaxy—at least at the moment. For example, Lando Calrissian clearly embodies the Scoundrel when encountered in The Empire Strikes Back. In Return o ftheJedi, however, he proves to be an extraordinary Pilot, indicating he spent some time focused on that specialization as well. CHOOSING A CAREER It’s easy enough to look at the game information and select purely on the rules material, but players will discover a richer experience if they do so with two key questions in mind: WHICH ROLE? When gathering at the table to start a new cam­ paign, one of the first questions that each person must answer for himself is, "which role will my character fill?” Diversity encourages creativity and excitement, and it could be a fairly limited cam­ paign if everyone at the table chooses to be Ex­ plorers or Smugglers. Certainly it’s possible to make stories work around such a premise, but the diversity of careers reflects the essence of a "ragtag bunch” gathered under diffi­ cult circumstances and doing the best they can to not only survive, but to thrive. Through a complex set of both complementary and divergent skills and talents, a group of PCs operating in the fringes can expect a much greater chance of success, as well as a much wider array of stories and plots to experience. With this in mind, a player’s two foundational choices are species and career. In selecting a ca­ reer, there are some questions and answers that may help in the evaluation process: • Should this character be a strong combatant? While it is absolutely true that any character in a Star Wars game should be able to handle himself in a fight, some are truly meant to excel in violent con­ flict resolution. A Hired Gun is the obvious primary choice for a career, although a Bounty Hunter is clearly a strong choice for this role as well. • Should this character be able to handle a starship? Piloting ships through the galaxy isn’t quite the same as driving a car, but it’s common enough to see interstellar travelers with at least a modicum of pilot skill. True aces, however, are go­ ing to be found among the Smugglers. Explorers are also strong in this area, and Bounty Hunters can manage the basics. • Should this character be a “face” for the group? There are times when talking may be far preferable to shooting or punching. Getting into some places, getting out of others, or getting in touch with im­ portant people—these are all situations in which a skilled negotiator or persuasive conversationalist is very valuable. The Colonist is the best career choice here, though Explorers and Smugglers also have some competency in this field. • Should this character be the “I know th a t” guy? Knowledge is power, and power is impor­ tant when facing off with the Empire and prob­ ably a handful of criminal overlords. Sometimes it’s about knowing things, and more often, it’s about knowing how to find out. Either way, Colo­ nists and Explorers are the best career choices to fulfill a role like this. • Should this character be the sneaky rogue type? Getting in, getting the stuff (or data), and getting out without being seen—very important abilities for fringe life. Let the bruisers and the hired guns duke it out toe-to-toe; that’s just a great distraction. The rogue PC will take the opportunity to get the real work done. Smugglers tend to be good in this area, as are Bounty Hunters. • Should this character be the consummate support person? For every character who stands up front fighting or dives in to make things hap­ pen, there are often many others who give their all to make sure he has what he needs to do his job and he comes back alive from doing it. The support character doesn’t get ail the glory, yet he is often the critical element that determines success or failure in any effort. The Colonist and the Technician are two powerful career choices for this kind of role. These are also good questions to consider in choose­ ing a specialization, but the career choice determines which specializations a character has best access to. Thus, having answers worked out at this point makes the entire process much easier and more effective. The kind of story a player wants to tell goes hand- in-hand with his character’s role. This includes ev­ erything that came before—his backstory—and all that may develop in the course of the game (and perhaps beyond). Consider one of the hallmark characters that truly exemplifies the theme of this book: Han Solo. From the moment Luke meets him in the cantina, his story unfolds before the audience. He is the owner of "the fastest ship in the galaxy,” by his account. He’s also outrun Imperial ships, which is a clear sign that he is no by-the-book transport pilot. The audience learns very quickly that Han is a rogue, a smuggler, a wanted man, and quick on the draw. Over time, and via various media, Han Solo’s story unfolds in both directions. Through books and comics, readers learn that he was once an Imperial officer can­ didate (until a certain Wookiee-related incident got him kicked out), and that piracy and smuggling have been an integral part of his growing up and early history. Other sources depict Solo’s future as one filled with both con­ flict and a continued refusal to play by the rules, even after he is married to the leader of the New Republic. Han’s story is clearly one best told with him as a Smuggler. That career most exemplifies the history of the character up to the point the “campaign” (Star Wars: A New Hope) began, and as the story contin­ ues, Han remains a Smuggler first and foremost. CHOOSING A SPECIALIZATION Selecting an initial specialization can be easily in­ formed by answering two questions: HOW DID THE CHARACTER GET INTO THIS LINE OF WORK? Figuring out the answer to this question should flow fairly easily from the process of choosing the char­ acter’s career. Having considered the history of the character, the player should be able to put some ad­ ditional focus on the parts of his story that led to his current professional circumstances. What was he doing before the campaign began? How did his circumstances lead him to where he is now? For whom was we working, and what work did he do? What natural talents does he possess? Does he have a reputa­ tion, and if so, on what was it built? As he grew up, did he have any special education or focus? Did someone take the time to teach him a specific set of skills? The player who takes the time to consider how his career choice developed prior to the campaign will likely find choosing his initial specialization far easier. WHAT'S THE STORY? E X AM PLE: S P EC IA LIZATIO N SELECTION T H R O U G H BA C KG RO UND Betty determines that she wants to be a galaxy- savvy Explorer. Her first instinct is to select the Scout specialization, but her CM encourages her to spend some time considering how her character got to the point where she is as the campaign begins. Betty lets her imagination wander, and a sto­ ry begins to form—she grew up on Coruscant, surrounded by duracrete and transparisteel, yet she longed for wide open spaces and natural surroundings. She did all she could to get off the planet and out into space. As Betty looks over the talent trees, she realizes that Fringer makes a lot of sense to her, providing a combination of the street savvy she should have being from Coruscant, a high level of toughness and grit, and the piloting gifts she really wants to exploit. WHAT KIND OF WORK DOES THE CHARACTER TYPICALLY DO? Another approach to choosing a specialization is to work out the character’s day-to-day professional life. When he gets up in the morning (or at whatever time his lifestyle demands), what does he do during the day? How does he get paid, and who pays him? If he’s not currently earning anything, what does he need to do in order to find work? Han Solo and Lando Calrissian are both smugglers, yet they clearly pursued different paths to make their way in the galaxy by the time they see each other again in The Empire Strikes Back. EX AM PLE: SPEC IA LIZATIO N SELECTION TH R O U G H W O R K Barry and Lee both want to play Technicians, yet they are determined to cover different bases. The GM encourages them to consider what their characters are most likely going to be hired for as a means of deciding who will do what. Lee really likes the idea of being called on to tinker with stuff to personalize it, improving on designs. Barry, meanwhile, realizes that he’s keen to play the guy everyone comes to when they want credits moved or information sliced out of the system. With this conversation, both players find their decisions easier to make: Lee will put together an Outlaw Tech, while Barry will build his character towards being a Slicer. THE BOUNTY HUNTER T he Bounty Hunter’s eight career skills are Athlet­ ics, Brawl, Perception, Piloting (Planetary), Piloting (Space), Ranged (Heavy), Streetwise, and Vigilance He automatically gains one rank in four of these skills (of his choosing) without spending experience, and he receives a discount when he spends experience to purchase ranks in any of these skills. A BOUNTY HUNTER'S ROLE The name says it all: this is a hunt­ er who seeks to collect bounties for his work. Bounty Hunt­ ers tend to be feared, reviled, looked down upon—and in great demand throughout the galaxy. They are expert trackers, brutal combatants, and effective investigators. They tend to prefer skulduggery, stealth, and traps over frontal assaults, but the most re­ spected Bounty Hunters will do what­ ever it takes to catch their quarries and collect their fees. Bounty Hunters generally fall with­ in three categories: Imperial Bounty Hunters, Guild Bounty Hunters, or In­ dependents. Imperial Bounty Hunt­ ers are essentially on permanent * contract to the Imperial Security Bureau (or a similar arm of Imperial law), and they never take assignments from corporations, smaller governments, or individu­ also. They are highly-trusted members of the extended law-enforcement community of the Empire, usually ex­ military personnel that prefer a less-regimented (if pos­ sibly dangerous) way to serve. Those Bounty Hunters who join a guild enjoy many excellent benefits: room and board wherever the guild has a presence, exceptional training and access to high-end equipment as needed for specific assign­ ments, and a steady stream of jobs given to them by the guild brokers acting on their behalf. The downside to all of this is the fact that Guild Bounty Hunters have little-to-no say in what jobs they get, and failure to ac­ cept an assignment is grounds for immediate termina­ tion of a guild contract. The greatest freedom comes with being an Inde­ pendent Bounty Hunter; it also comes with the great­ est challenges and dangers. Although Independents often take Imperial contracts, which are usually the most readily available and lucrative, they enjoy know­ ing they are not exactly a p ort of the Empire. Not being a part of a guild also serves an Independent Bounty Hunter’s sensibilities; he can pick and choose his contracts as he likes, and has only himself to credit for success or failure. Player Characters are almost certainly going to be either Guild or Independent Hunters. However, re­ gardless of what type of Bounty Hunter is played, the character will need to have a current and legitimate Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate (IPKC). This is the specific license that all Bounty Hunters are required to have on file with the Empire in order to operate as professionals. Without such documentation and status, a Bounty Hunter is little more than a kidnap­ per and, possibly, a murderer. Any character with the Bounty Hunter career automatically gains an IPKC— unless the player would prefer his character not start with one. Although this may seem like an odd choice, it could make for a particularly compelling story or character background. BOUNTYHUNTER SPECIALIZATIONS The specializations are covered in greater detail in the following sections; this section mainly deals with how each specialization connects to the Bounty Hunter Career. ASSASSIN-INSTRUMENT OF POLICY Whereas most Bounty Hunters focus primarily on the capture of quarry, those who specialize as Assassins are generally tasked with the straightforward proposi­ tion of terminating their targets. The selection of addi­ tional skills for an Assassin very much points towards his focus: Melee, Ranged (Heavy), Skulduggery, and Stealth These four skills become additional Ca­ reer skills. If this is the character’s starting Specializa­ tion, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experi­ ence. Assassins tend to prefer getting in quietly, tak­ ing out targets (either up close or sniping from afar), and leaving just as silently as they entered. Their tal­ ents are very appropriate for this kind of work. Despite their different methods, Assassins still adhere to many of the same ethics and practices of other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seri­ ously, avoid all needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts to the letter. Some treat their methods with reverence, even assigning a certain mystique to it. Others simply see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it. GADGETEER—CONNOISSEUR OF TECH Considering how often a single Bounty Hunter finds himself faced with terrible odds (more often than not, an acquisition has friends or employees who work hard to protect him), it’s not surprising how many spe­ cialize in high-tech gear and weapons. The Cadgeteer excels at presenting himself as a one-person battle force, at least for a short time. Using both the latest tech and his own personally-modified gear, a Bounty Hunter with this specialization can be hard to stop. Cadgeteers add the skills Brawl, Coercion, M e­ chanics. and Ranged (Light) to their repertoire of class skills, making them ranged combat experts, effective technicians, and masters of surveillance. If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Cad­ geteer talents lean heavily towards gear use, taking down targets, and adapting to tough situations. Cadgeteer-specialized Bounty Hunters are in many ways the ultimate hybrid of tech expert and combat­ ant; for smaller groups, this may be a perfect choice. Cadgeteers—especially those that are operating as Independent Bounty Hunters—have little trouble signing on for nearly any job. After all, the credits they need for that next nifty piece of tech have to come from somewhere. SURVIVALIST—MASTER OF THE WILD Beyond civilization, in the farthest reaches of the gal­ axy, there are places where few (if any) sentients have ever trodden the ground. Places like these are ideal hiding places for those fleeing the law or retribution for their actions. Places like these are where Bounty Hunters who specialize as Survivalists thrive. Harkening back to the ancient practices of. true wilder­ ness hunters, the Survivalist gains Knowledge (Xenolo- gy), Perception, Resilience, and Survival as additional Career skills. If this is the character’s starting Specializa­ tion, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. With his talent array, he can keep himself and his companions alive, and he knows where and what to look for when searching for just about anything or anyone. He's also gifted at hunting any kind of target. Not everything that happens in the galaxy occurs in cities or out in space. In fact, most of the habitable places of the galaxy are rural or wilderness in nature. A specialization in Survivalist ensures a character has the necessary knowledge and training to make his way in such environments, and help the far more urban-minded folks he’s likely traveling with. Despite their capacity to live off the land, Surviv- alists enjoy credits and the things that can be pur­ chased with them just like anyone else. They will often look to hire themselves out to customers who need their expertise in seeking out (or hunting) something beyond the duracrete and tapcafs. BOUNTYHUNTER STORIES The average, sane person does not become a Bounty Hunter. Each Bounty Hunter has his own reason to em­ bark on his chosen career, and these reasons may have rich story potential. Here are just a few ideas: • Revenge: Many Bounty Hunters get into the business as a means to achieving revenge against someone (or a group) that has otherwise escaped justice. Their initial motives are very personal, usually due to the loss of something or some­ one precious to them. Once justice is achieved, however, a person who has trained and practiced such skills and talents will often discover this is now his path. • Disgrace: Utter failure or a terrible tragedy might well drive him to seek a career that takes him away from his former life. Tracking criminals across the galaxy, he can build a completely dif­ ferent life and reputation for. himself, hopefully leaving his past behind him. However, he may not be so lucky. • Honor: Some people find that the law they serve is being trod upon by the very people for whom they work. Others watch corruption and tyranny crush everyone around them, and they come to decide they’ve had enough. Such a Bounty Hunter may have been a law enforcement agent, or perhaps just someone who decided enough was enough. He’s decided to defend justice and the law in his own way, perhaps even against those he once served. • Aggression: There are those in the galaxy who just need to hit people, or do something both ac­ tive and dangerous. Marching in ranks and follow­ ing orders doesn’t suit them,but beating some­ one into unconsciousness before handing them over for a paycheck certainly does. Such a Hunter may have washed out of military service, or de­ cided to run from assault charges (or worse) and this seemed like a good fallback plan. • Legacy: Perhaps his father—and his father’s fa­ ther—was a Bounty Hunter, and he’s chosen to follow the family tradition. It could be that he is from a culture that reveres those who track transgressors, or that an honored friend wanted to pass his skills along to someone. Whatever the source, such a Bounty Hunter tends to view the traditions of the trade with great reverence and respect. THE BOUNTY HUNTER'S CREED Al lthough Bounty Hunters are often perceived as honorless scum, this is generally not true. Most Bounty Hunters simply follow a very dif­ ferent set of rules from the average civilian, known as the Bounty Hunter's Creed. In broad strokes, its tenets include: • People Don’t Have Bounties; Only Acquisitions Have Bounties: Anyone with a bounty on his head isn’t a per­ son anymore; he’s an "acquisition." • Capture By Design; Kill By Neces­ sity: A Bounty Hunter should at least try to bring his target in alive. • No Hunter Shall Slay Another Hunter: This rule, and the next, may be "creatively interpreted," and sometimes the cause of death can be hard to prove. • No Hunter Shall Interfere With Another’s Hunt: In general, Hunters leave one another alone. • In the Hunt, One Captures or Kills; Never Both: Once an acquisition has been captured alive, the Bounty Hunt­ er is obligated to keep him that way until the bounty is claimed. • No Hunter Shall Refuse Aid to An­ other Hunter: Bounty Hunters take care of their own. But there’s nothing v wrong with negotiating a fee...

THE COLONIST F or the Colonist, the eight defining career skills are Charm, Deception, Knowledge (Core Worlds), Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Lore), Lead­ ership, Negotiation, and Streetwise He automati­ cally gains one rank in four of these skills (of his choose­ ing) without spending experience, and he receives a discount when he spends experience to purchase ranks in any of these skills. A COLONISTS ROLE In a way, Colonists are the most out- of-place people in the Outer Rim. They are most often from the Core Worlds, where they were well edu­ cated and part of the cultural and professional elite. A Colonist doesn't tend to have the training to survive in areas of high conflict, and he isn’t particularly adept at physical exploits. What he does possess, however, is a keen grasp of the bigger pic­ true, and he usually has both the knowledge to understand prob­ lems and the capacity to get them solved. He probably came to the Outer Rim to create opportuni­ ties for himself, or to find a bet­ ter life than what he left behind. If he cannot find that better life, he’ll apply all of his knowledge to the task of creating it, and he'll use his considerable social skills to gather like-minded allies to his cause. Of course, not all Colonists are necessarily altruistic in their pursuits. If knowledge is power, and power corrupts, then it follows that the Colonist is well-suited to take what he knows and exploit it for per­ sonal wealth. With charisma and street smarts, a Colonist might gather quite a team of specialists together to both watch his back and see to it that his enemies are brought to heel as he solidifies his power base. Countless Outer Rim worlds have become the person­ al fiefs of Colonists with bold ideas and willing followers. Of course, some Colonists fail in their pursuits, and run afoul of the law or their fellows. These Colonists are forced to flee their lives of luxury and survive wherever they can. Some of these individuals may fall in with less reputable, even criminal, individuals. Luckily, these unfortunate Colonists sometimes find their unique skill sets are in high demand. The clever Colonists—the ones most likely to survive their first few months in the Outer Rim—figure out how to parlay their knowledge and talents into currency and contacts. Providing excellent advice, medical aid, or valuable knowledge can easily endear a Colonist to a warlord or gang leader, giving him the very thing he needs most: security. From a position of relative safety, a wise Colonist will begin gathering connections and data, building up a network that he can one day exploit for his aims, whatever they may be. Colonists are the consummate leaders, negotiators, in­ spirational speakers, and strategists. A Colonist can take any small group of capable operators and turn them into a true force to be reckoned with. A capable Colonist in a group can mean the difference between just getting by and doing something truly spectacular in the galaxy. COLONIST SPECIALIZATIONS The following overviews of the Colonist specializations create some context for deciding which one will best serve as a player’s beginning choice. DOCTOR-THE GIFT OF HEALING Of all the types of Colonists who come to the Outer Rim, Doctors probably have the easiest time finding employment. They are in high demand almost any­ where they go. Unfortunately, most of what they are asked to do involves patching up the wounds of the worst kind of beings. The Doctor adds Cool, Knowledge (Education), Medicine, and Resilience to his Career skills. If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, with­ out spending starting experience. With these skills, a Doctor brings not only healing and the treatment of ill­ nesses with him, he brings a broad spectrum of knowl­ edge and a solid persona in the face of adversity. Most Doctors trade their healing talents for a chance to see more of the galaxy than their time in medical school ever allowed. Their overall motives can be as var­ ied as those of any being, yet they tend to share a com­ mon instinct to heal where there is harm. While many will simply take up residence with whatever lord, corpo­ ration, or boss will hire them, other Doctors will find a way to get out into the larger galaxy, both to bring help to those in need and to experience life in some fashion. A Player Character Doctor is likely to be consid­ ered a kind of “combat medic” for the group; this isn’t a bad thing at all, and the role will make him very popular. At the same time, a Doctor can often help with broader issues of understanding or find­ ing things out, especially if there isn’t a Scholar in the group. POLITICO—THE GIFT OF LEADERSHIP If there is one thing a Politico knows how to do better than anyone else in the galaxy, it’s talking. He can talk to anyone about anything in any necessary way. What others accomplish with might and fear, a talented Po­ litico may well achieve with a few well-placed words and a decent plan. Politicos gain the Career skills of Charm, Coer­ cion, Deception, and Knowledge (Core Worlds) If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, w ithout spending starting experience. A Politico might join a discussion, speech, or de­ bate in any number of ways. With his talents, he might act to inspire greatness in those around him, or he might know just what to say to cut an o p ­ ponent to the core, diminishing his confidence and leaving him vulnerable. Politicos in the Outer Rim are usually up to some­ thing; ambition is hardwired into their very being. They may not yet know what they wish to accomplish, but when they see an opportunity to achieve some kind of greater goal, they will turn all their will and personality towards achieving it. Politicos might sign on to temporarily work for another, but they will not long be happy in a subservient role. Leadership is the core of who they are. In a group, the Politico works best as the front-man, or the "face." More than anyone, he is best suited for initial contacts with any being or group, and he’s the best to have at any negotiation, social gathering, or interrogation. There are even times when he can bring up morale in combat and crisis situations, though the palace throne room, corporate board room, or casino floor tend to be better battlefields for him. SCHOLAR-THE GIFT OF KNOWLEDGE At first, the idea of a Scholar wandering with a bunch of ne’er-do-wells in the Outer Rim might seem a bit odd, if not downright ridiculous. However, with all of the dangers and wonders of “a thousand thousand worlds,” having someone around who actually knows something more than how to reload a heavy blaster could be exceedingly useful under any number of cir­ cumstances. This is especially true when a group is faced with something truly unknown, or needs to find something that simple tracking alone cannot locate. THE COLONY T he Outer Rim is dotted with colonies large and small, each with its own character. Some are small farming communities with little con­ tact with the galaxy at large. Others are mining settlements, ruthlessly exploited by corporate or criminal overseers. Each colony could serve as a home or point of origin for any PC, and each could serve as the site of many adven­ tures in the Star Wars galaxy. Here are a few ideas for colonies that can serve as home base for a colonist PC: • A small farming community that grows a vital crop. • A nomadic caravan of speeders and ground vehicles, herding enormous alien creatures on a remote planet. • A political or religious outcast group in hiding from the Empire. Knowledge (Outer Rim), Knowledge (Under­ world), Knowledge (Xenology), and Perception are the Scholar's bonus career skills from his specializa­ tion, If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These skills emphasize both his role as a font of info­ mation and his keen awareness of his surroundings. Even in the Outer Rim, there are those who have a keen respect for knowledge and learning. Even criminal overlords find having some "brains" around helps them when they want to expand their operations or exploit a new opportunity. Other Scholars, however, are far more interested in getting out into the galaxy, seeing for themselves the things they wish to study, and dig­ ging around in ancient places for the lost knowledge they want to uncover. A Scholar in a group is very likely of the field research­ er variety; seeking allies with physical capabilities who can defend him is a matter of simple expediency. It may be that he’s signed on with some kind of operation that actually has no direct impact on his research, but the group is likely to travel to places he wishes to go, which suits his desires well. COLONIST STORIES What drives a Colonist to abandon the comforts and safety of the Core Worlds and take such terrible risks out in the dangerous Outer Rim? What might he be seeking? Are his ambitions noble or purely selfish? Here are some possibilities: • Knowledge: Despite doctrine to the contrary, the vast data resources of the Empire do not contain the sum of all knowledge. In fact, there are entire subjects that are continuously being subverted and redacted, with entire periods of history and elements of culture being systemati­ cally removed. A Colonist may be searching the Outer Rim, hoping to find important information about a subject lost to such purges, or perhaps he simply wishes to follow the trail of a particular legend or mythos. An academic career might well be founded on the knowledge one might uncover on a far distant planet. • Power: If an individual believes himself a born leader, yet has neither the ear of the Emperor nor access to the corridors of power, frustration might drive him to truly desperate measures. In the Out­ er Rim, opportunities abound for those with plenty of determination and charisma. Before the Empire sweeps across a particular planet, an ambitious Colonist might find a seat to call a throne. Some­ one will have to negotiate with Imperial agents upon arrival, and it might as well be him. • Nobility: In this time of turmoil and war, count­ less millions suffer, and neither the Empire nor those who seek to bring it down offer any aid. For someone with the knowledge and means to help, the call to do so may be too strong to ig­ nore. Making his way to the Outer Rim, a Colo­ nist might seek any number of ways to apply his gifts to make at least a few lives a little better. Of course, the realities of survival may mean mak­ ing some pragmatic decisions, but he’s decent at heart, and he’ll do what he can out there. • Understanding: Sitting in a perfect, sterile, luxu­ rious home, surrounded by servants, wanting for nothing, a person may find his life has no true challenges. The machinery of the Empire runs in­ exorably towards domination of the galaxy; has it truly all come to this? Is there nothing left to dis­ cover, to struggle against? Perhaps becoming a Colonist is nothing more than a decision to leave behind comfort and complacency in order to em­ brace the challenges left in the galaxy, hopefully to better understand life and one’s place in it. • Revolution: With the destruction of the Death Star, a glimmer of hope has been ignited in the galaxy. There are those who finally see the total confidence in the New Order shaken at all levels. While there is still no chance for change in the Core Worlds, the Outer Rim could finally offer a chance to stir the embers, to galvanize populations and acquire resources. A Colonist may have to bide his time and act carefully, cultivating contacts, allies, and re­ sources over time, but out on the Rim, he might well point the way towards unchaining the galaxy from the yoke of the Empire’s oppression.

THE EXPLORER AN EXPLORER'S ROLE The Empire is vast, but it is a mere fraction of the gal­ axy, and the Explorer seeks to uncover the countless mysteries and opportunities the universe contains. Ex­ plorers are both vitally important and insidiously dan­ gerous to the New Order; on the one hand, they reveal information, trade routes, and resources that are deep­ ly coveted by the Empire, and on the other hand, they expand the ranges into which rebels, criminals, and iconoclasts can spread out and avoid Imperial might. The Empire employs countless scouts and mer­ cantile agents, and there are many more such enti­ ties working for the millions of galactic corporations seeking advantage over one another as they expand. The Explorer is a free agent; he makes his own way, tracks his own discoveries, and arranges his own spe­ cial deals and connections. He will often sell the infor­ mation he has at a decent price, or arrange to guide those who wish to go where he has been. Other Explorers scour the HoloNet and other data services, looking for groups, businesses, or organiza­ tions in need. This is why the most well-traveled Ex­ plorers are in the greatest demand: they have maps and information about places only a fraction of a per­ cent of the galaxy's population might knows even ex­ ist. An Explorer with data about a planet a company wishes to exploit, or with a safe route to a part of the galaxy a group wishes to use for covert operations, can demand top prices. Any Explorer relatively new to the trade finds himself in the classic conundrum—he needs experience in or­ der to attain the choicest contracts, yet he cannot gain that experience because he cannot get hired. As such, many Explorers will take on any opportunity to travel and work in the Outer Rim, gathering what knowledge and leads they can in order to build up their contacts, resources, and their library of maps and routes. Most commonly, Explorers are able to parlay their astroga- tion and pilot skills into work opportunities. EXPLORER SPECIALIZATIONS This section offers a brief overview of each specializa­ tion and how it connects to the Explorer Career. FRINGER—DISCOVERING POSSIBILITIES Part negotiator, part astrogator, and savvy in the ways of the galaxy beyond the Core Worlds, the Fringer is a jack-of-all-trades. He focuses on knowing how to find what he needs and how to get where he needs to go. He’s got the gift of gab when it’s time to talk, and the awareness and reflexes to maneuver away when it’s time to run. The additional Career skills for a Fringer are indica­ tive of his diversified nature: Astrogation, Coordi­ nation, Negotiation, and Streetwise If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Fringers are skilled navigators and rugged survivalists. Many Fringers are excellent pilots, some rivaling even Smugglers in terms of talent. They are also highly prized for their ability to navigate ships through the unknown ranges of the Outer Rim. Fringers can also be tough, wiry, and nimble, surprising any would-be assailant with their ability to avoid getting hit and avoid getting caught. A Player Character Fringer stands a good chance of being either the primary or secondary pilot for a group; he’ll certainly be the likely choice for handling astrogation duties. He may also be the one the group turns to when it comes to dealing with employers, or finding a job in the first place. If someone needs to go into a starport or town to handle business, the Fringer should definitely be a part of that excursion. SCOUT-DISCOVERING NEW PLANETS There’s finding a planet, and then there’s going down to the planet and seeing what’s what. The Scout is the professional for the task, trained to survey and survive, gathering all of the information he can while keeping his head attached to his body. While brav­ ery in combat is one thing, there can be no denying the fearlessness of anyone willing to touch down on a completely unknown planet and trudge about with only scanners and his wits to discover its secrets. A Scout knows his way around in any environment, and he’s both tough and knowledgeable enough to make the most of his situation. His additional Career skills make his job much easier: Athletics, Medicine, Piloting (Planetary), and Survival If this is the charac­ ter’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Most Scouts are skilled at: covering any ground (or lack thereof); how to find what to eat and where to sleep; and how to survey an area and gather all the needed data. Scouts are often excellent at driving or piloting atmospheric craft as well. There are plenty of Scouts that work either for the Empire or for corporations that actively seek out and survey planets for possible exploitation. They nor­ mally work with survey teams with excellent support and resources. Independent Scouts—like the one a player is likely to play—operate with a great deal more autonomy. They will find smaller operations to work with, ones with looser rules and regulations that let them operate more as they choose. Living by his toughness and wits as he must, a Scout will be surpris­ ingly effective in most situations. After all, adapting to the unknown is a trademark talent of any Scout. TRADER—DISCOVERING NEW MARKETS Those seeking to take what they discover as they ex­ plore the Outer Rim and beyond (and turn a serious profit from it) are Traders. For a Trader, a new planet represents nigh-infinite potential for resource exploi­ tation, while a new culture or hidden community is a customer base just begging for his particular talents. Traders gain access to the additional Career skills of Deception, Knowledge (Core Worlds), Knowledge (Underworld), and Negotiation If this is the char­ acter’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Most Traders know how to build connections between the center of civilization and the far reaches, and they are often educated folks who bring knowledge and proficiency in economics, sociology, and politics with them. Traders are exceptionally adept at commerce, natu­ rally; they know how to find what is needed, and can usually bypass the kinds of restrictions that stymie oth­ ers. At the same time, Traders can get the most out of a transaction, as well as talk themselves into or out of al­ most anything. Traders are strategic thinkers, planning ahead for contingencies. They are also strong-willed, making them excellent companions in a crisis. A Trader played in a campaign will likely serve as the group’s public face, though not necessarily as the leader. Fie will be one of the best first choices for in­ teracting with public officials, money men, and any­ one with whom the group seeks to do business. When it comes to finding and buying something that the team needs, or fencing something that they wish to get rid of for a profit, he is invaluable. EXPLORER STORIES The following are some suggested starting points to consider for an Explorer’s story. Any one or more of them might serve to build a background with, or as a guide for both the player and the CM. • Wanderlust: The most common trait among Ex­ plorers is the need to travel, to move about the galaxy as much as possible and see all that may be seen. Most Explorers simply want to see what the next planet is like, or where they might end up if they simply set out in any direction and go as far as they can. An Explorer with this as a story focus probably grew up wanting to catch a ride on the first starship he could, and once he left the surface, he never looked back. • Hunted: With the rise of the Empire, many have found reasons to seek their fortunes as far away from the Core Worlds as possible. An enemy of the New Order, or perhaps just an enemy to a powerful individual with a lot of credits, a person UNKNOWN STARS T here are, by most estimations, about 400 bil­ lion stars in the galaxy. Only a tiny fraction of these have been explored and even fewer have been described in any official Star Wars publica­ tion. An explorer character may well have seen a star or a planet unknown to anyone else in the galaxy. This knowledge could be a defining part of a character's Obligation or Motivation, or be­ come important to a future storyline. may take to the Explorer life as a matter of simple expediency; get lost in the Outer Rim, and stay on the move. • Guilt: A powerful emotion, guilt can drive a per­ son to try to get as far away from where he began as possible. An Explorer may well have had no in­ tention of pursuing such a career, yet he became an expert at moving from place to place, learn­ ing many things along the way. He’s running, but what he runs from is his own conscience, and he’ll never escape it. • Quest: A lost lover, a stolen family treasure, or the legend of a powerful artifact—any of these things, or something else entirely, might be the lure that draws an Explorer to wander the Outer Rim and beyond. He’s accumulated maps, he’s made contacts, and his notes fill dozens of pads, yet the object of his quest continues to elude him. Such an Explorer may well be one of the most experienced and capable, yet there will al­ ways be that nagging doubt for anyone working with him. Will he cut and run at the first sign of the goal of his search? • Profit: Throughout the ages, Explorers have al­ ways seen the uncharted territories as lands of milk and honey, just waiting for some enterprising soul to come along and scoop up the gold with buckets. Although any Explorer worth his salt will know this isn’t ever going to be literally true, he will see every planet as the potential source of great riches. Whether it’s untapped resources or a brand new market of sentient beings just wait­ ing to start buying landspeeders, a profit-seeking Explorer is ready to start raking in the credits the moment he’s planetside.

HraE CHORE® QDDGO T he Hired Gun’s eight career skills are Ath­ letics, Brawl, Discipline, Melee, Piloting (Planetary), Ranged (Light), Resilience, and Vigilance. He automatically gains one rank in four of these skills (of his choosing) without spending experience, and he receives a dis­ count when he spends experience to pur­ chase ranks in any of these skills. A HIRED GUN'S ROLE When it comes to fighting, the Hired Gun is at the forefront. He’s less of an in de pe nde nt operator than the Bounty Hunter, preferring to have a de­ fined mission, an objective to achieve, and some credits to | spend when the job is done. Hired Guns are muscle and ap­ plied force, meant to defend [ or attack as the situation re­ quires. They deal damage or protect others for credits, ! and this makes them sim­ ple and sometimes refresh­ ingly direct. A Hired Gun one typically encounters in the Outer Rim likely came from one of three kinds of backgrounds; he may have been a soldier for the Empire (or, possibly, even for the Old Republic before its fall), he might have served with a plan­ etary or organizational force of some kind, or he simply came up hard, learning how to shoot and fight because that was the only way he could survive. However he came by them, the Hired Gun has the kinds of skills and talents that make it fairly easy to find work in the Outer Rim and the fringes of society. Many Hired Guns are true mercenaries, either work­ ing for themselves or contracted to a guild or company of some kind. Much like Bounty Hunters, the Hired Guns who are part of a guild tend to enjoy a great deal of support. They do not, however, have much in the way of freedom. More than a few Hired Guns have walked away from contracts that either violated their personal ethics or left them feeling completely exploited with terrible terms of service. Unfortunately, such mercenar­ ies are left watching their backs for years after. Independent Hired Guns enjoy the greatest freedom, yet they also spend a lot of time just trying to find a good job, and preferably one that doesn't give them a life expectancy measured in days. Reputation can mean everything for such professionals, yet a simple test of skills and competency may often result in a bet­ ter arrangement if the right employer is impressed. HIRED GUN SPECIALIZATIONS What follows is a brief summary of each specialization for this career, and how they apply to the career and to the player’s decisions. BODYGUARD—PERSONAL DEFENDER Hired Guns who choose the Bodyguard specialization are excellent choices for defending both people and places. They tend to be highly capable with all kinds of weapon­ ry, extremely tough and savvy in combat, and exactly the right people to get behind when blaster fire starts flying. Their additional Career skills are indicative of their job: Gunnery, Perception, Piloting (Planetary), and Ranged (Heavy) If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. With this array of skills, a Bodyguard can operate anything that shoots, keep a good eye on his surroundings, and can handle any planet-bound craft with great aptitude. This, combined with his talent options, makes him potentially perfect as an armed chauffeur o r as a heavy weapons emplacement op­ erator. He also makes a resilient soldier. A Bodyguard will have a rather easy time finding work in the Outer Rim, especially if he doesn’t mind looking after the backside of high-ranking criminal scum or corporate operators who are trying to do business without becoming victims. His facility with all kinds of weapons and vehicles make him useful to any number of quasi-legal or criminal operations. As part of a group of Player Characters, a Body­ guard is going to be considered more or less a heavy combatant—the guy who stands up front with the biggest gun. However, the combination of skills and talents can be angled towards some different ap­ proaches. For example, if there’s any kind of Politico or Trader in the group, a Bodyguard may well be there solely for the purpose of keeping that person alive. MARAUDER-UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL Marauders don’t necessarily mind shooting their op­ ponents, but they would much rather get mixed up in a melee, weapons in hand, smashing and slashing their way through. Marauders are tough—probably the toughest combatants in any conflict. They tend to take a great deal of punishment while dealing out far more to any who dare go against them. A Marauder’s list of additional Career skills is not at all surprising Coercion, Melee, Resilience, and Sur­ vival If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Marauders make excellent ‘‘leg-breakers,’’ among other things, and they usually know quite a bit about how to survive in most situations. In combat, they are masters of dishing out and taking lots of damage. Marauders may come from low-tech worlds, where advanced weaponry simply wasn’t an option for them. Alternately, they might come from a culture where melee combat is considered far more honorable and worthy, and they keep to their traditions. Moreover, many pirates and raiders of starships favor melee weapons in order to avoid damaging vital systems aboard a ship they’re in the middle of trying to take. A character who chooses to be a Marauder might be an ex-pirate. Alternatively, he could be in the adventure to make money in the only way he can—with his fists. It could be that he’s simply along for the ride, ready to bash his way through whatever adventure he encounters. MERCENARY SOLDIER-MASTER OF WAR If the Marauder is the melee master, and the Body­ guard is the all-around weapons and gear trooper, the Mercenary Soldier is the warfare expert. An adept of both ranged combat and military tactics, he is a leader of warriors in combat and a deadly combatant himself. Mercenary Soldiers add the career skills of Disci­ pline, Gunnery, Leadership and Ranged (Heavy) If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. A Merce­ nary Soldier can be a true mental rock in critical situ­ ations. He is a deadly foe all on his own, and deadlier still if he has a force to lead in battle. Mercenary Soldiers are the most likely to have come from prior service with a larger organization, and they almost certainly had at least a non-commis­ sioned officer role with that force. They have a keen grasp of both tactics and strategy, though they will tend to focus more on the former as a matter of prac­ ticality and survival. Even in less formal situations, a Mercenary Soldier will tend to show a high degree of personal discipline and order. In a Player Character group, it will not be out of the question for a Mercenary Soldier to take charge, at least in situations where combat is likely. Though his leadership skills are not as comprehensive as other specializations, they are uniquely focused for combat. HIRED GUN STORIES There are many places a Hired Gun might come from, and many directions he might take from one moment to the next. Warrior stories are timeless and compel­ ling, and they need not be simplistic affairs. • Worthiness: Many who walk the warrior path do so in order to live up to the expectations of those around them. Such a Hired Gun may come from a truly war-like culture, or one where survival of the fittest is greatly admired. Hired Guns might also come from families with a history of military service or combative excellence; they set out to prove themselves worthy of their heritage. • Conscience: In the time of the Empire, many sol­ diers discover they can no longer serve a regime given to such ruthless tactics and even genocidal policies. Such a Hired Gun may not have a par­ ticularly extensive set of morals or ethics, but there are some things he simply won't do, such as killing the defenseless or enslaving entire popula­ tions. Not willing to throw his life away taking on the entire New Order by himself, he simply grabs what he can and heads out into the far reaches, hoping he can disappear among the stars and make a living doing what he does best. • Purpose: Some people grow up with a natural gift for combat, or their lives require them to de­ velop such skills for survival, and they become very good at it. Such a Hired Gun may never have meant to pursue a violent career, yet that’s the hand that was dealt him, and he's going to play it. With nothing better to do, he makes his way into the galaxy and looks for a way to use what he knows to get by, and perhaps, do something meaningful with his life. • Respect: He may not be very smart. He may look like a meteor shower pummeled his face. He may know very little beyond how to use and maintain his weapons, but he knows those skills very well, and he’s going to get some respect from some­ one before he's through. Hired Guns with such a story are often easily manipulated, but they can also make excellent friends; you just have to give them their due credit. • Escape: Knowing how to fight can come from training, but it can also come from surviving against terrible odds or a vicious environment full of enemies. A Hired Gun from such a back­ ground may simply be doing the only thing he's ever known, applying his experience in a way that helps him get away from a past he wants nothing to do with. Perhaps he doesn’t know very much, but he’s determined to learn all he can in order to ensure no one can come and take him back to that place.

S mugglers are a crafty, diverse bunch with core skills as follows: Coordination, De­ ception, Knowledge (Underworld), Per­ ception, Piloting (Space), Skulduggery, Streetwise, and Vigilance He automatical­ ly gains one rank in four of these skills (of his choosing) without spending experience, and he receives a discount when he spends expe­ rience to purchase ranks in any of these skills. THE SMUGGLER'S ROLE Though they spend most of their lives struggling to avoid Imperial entangle­ ments, keeping their ships flying, dodg­ ing blaster fire, and having enough to eat, Smugglers are often seen as the freest beings in the galaxy. They travel the hyperspace lanes, system to sys­ tem, planet to planet, bringing what people want and need (and cannot get through legitimate means). Unfortunately, that freedom is of­ ten an illusion; many Smugglers find themselves indebted to powerful people, having been forced to take a marker on their ships just to stay in business. Such markers inevita­ bly lead Smugglers into a kind of indentured servitude un­ less they can figure a way out of it. That requires a very big “score" of some kind—a job of such financial reward, the Smuggler can buy his ship back and afford to operate on his own again. Few Smugglers survive that kind of job. Most just deal with their circumstances and keep their ships going. Even with a marker on the ship, though, Smugglers tend to have a great deal of autonomy, and they develop a great many skills and talents that any group making their way through the Out­ er Rim will find helpful. Smugglers know their way around the underworld and fringe society, and they tend to know how to get things done, especially if legality isn't an issue. THE SMUGGLER Smugglers are a vital part of Outer Rim society. With tariffs, quantity restrictions, and outright ban­ ning of even basic necessities being shipped to worlds not fully under Imperial Law, a great many people would be scratching out the poorest sort of existence, or perhaps dying outright due to lack of food and medicine. Smugglers’ ships are the lifelines that keep many distant population centers going. Of course, the most profitable cargoes are the ones that will land someone in the Kessel spice mines if he's caught with them. SMUGGLER SPECIALIZATIONS The various ways a Smuggler can focus his efforts are covered here, with each specialization detailed below. PILO T-A GALAXY OF DESTINATIONS Plenty of folks know how to fly a starship, but a Smug­ gler who specializes as a Pilot develops a relationship with his ship, and it becomes an extension of his wit and his will. He can make a plodding old transport run far above its performance ratings, and given time and some modifications, he can turn it into one of the fleetest and most maneuverable craft ever to take to the stars. A Pilot is naturally focused on mastering his craft, and his additional career skills show it: Astroga- tion, Gunnery, Piloting (Planetary), and Piloting (Space) If this is the character’s starting Specializa­ tion, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, w ithout spending starting expe­ rience. A Pilot’s talents further reinforce his dom i­ nance in the cockpit. Pilot is another specialization that rarely leads to unemployment. If a Pilot doesn’t already have his own ship (and the inevitable Obligation that goes with it), he will likely be able to sign on with any number of groups, criminal or otherwise. Once he establishes his competency at the controls, he’ll be able to get some fairly choice assignments. A Player Character Pilot will be considered indispensable to his group, especially after the first space battle or ship-related crisis. SCOUNDREL-A GALAXY OF MARKS Part con artist, part gunslinger, and part cantina brawl­ er, the Scoundrel is quick-witted, quick on his feet, and quick to get himself into a great deal of trouble at the drop of a hat. He doesn’t care one whit for rules or laws, except where he can use them to work an angle that either nets him a lot of credits or brings down an enemy. If he’s really lucky—and he tends to have an unshakable faith in his luck—he’ll manage both. His dynamic nature is spelled out in the Scoun­ drel's additional career skills: Charm, Cool, Decep­ tion, and Ranged (Light) If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spend­ ing starting experience. Combined with his talents, these skills make him formidable in a fight, useful in dealing with the underworld, and an individual sim­ ply not to be trusted. Scoundrels fulfill many roles in the Outer Rim. Some are grifters, others are middle-men, and still others are simply thrill-seekers looking to see what they can get into next. Scoundrels tend to avoid tak­ ing charge of anything, but they are more than willing to ride the coattails of powerful people, often apply­ ing their unique skill set to help their employer in any number of ways. Scoundrels rarely put down roots for very long, and will always be looking for the next in­ teresting thing to do (especially if it can make them some money). In a Player Character group, the Scoundrel is a kind of all-purpose character. He’s got enough under­ world savvy and social ability to act as a “face’’ for the group, and he’s no slouch in a fight. He may or may not be a pilot, but it’s almost certain he’s got many of the rogue-style abilities a group might need. T H IE F -A GALAXY OF TREASURES Where the Scoundrel is a bit flashier, and the Pilot fo­ cuses on mastering his ship, the Thief really is a covert operative. His ideal circumstance is to get into places blocked to others, grab things he’s not supposed to have, and get out without anyone ever knowing he was there. If he can sell what he grabbed for a tidy sum, that makes for a perfect day. Thieves gain the additional career skills Comput­ ers, Skulduggery, Stealth, and Vigilance If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, with­ out spending starting experience. Combined with his talents, a Thief is particularly adept at hiding, spot­ ting the hidden, getting past locks and security, and getting the jump on opponents in combat. He also knows his way around the underworld and where to get what’s needed. Generally, Thieves tend to either operate with a group that shares in their larcenous goals, or they work alone. The galaxy is full of treasures, many of which are guarded by locks and goons. A Thief will gladly handle the locks, though he’ll probably ap­ preciate having some back-up to handle the goons if things go badly. Then again, if he’s truly good at what he does, that shouldn’t happen. Some Thieves gain a strong enough reputation that they are offered contract opportunities by powerful people or groups, seeking to accomplish something against an oppo­ nent that is far beyond the realms of legal action. Of course, Thieves must always be on the lookout for a double-cross. As a part of a Player Character team, a Thief may not even identify himself by his specialization, prefer­ ring to display skills and abilities that are more generi- cally appropriate to his career as a Smuggler. Frankly, most Smugglers have at least some skill in the areas that he is masterful with, so he might never have to re­ veal much more than that. Still, having a master Thief on a team may mean getting into—and out of—some seriously difficult places in the future. SMUGGLER STORIES The life of a Smuggler is a storied experience all its own, but how one comes to the life, or where one is going, can be the source of some fairly defining narra­ tive. Such tales empower both the player and the CM to more fully flesh out the Smuggler character. • The Journey: For some, any destination is a good one, especially if it is somewhere they’ve never been before. Such a Smuggler will sometimes take a job just because it goes to a system he’s not flown to, even if he could make more taking one of his usual routes. Fie started out hitching rides on tramp freighters, moving cargo and wiping decks down, just so he’d get a chance to see new stars. He's never quite lost that love of the journey. • The Secret: For someone who’s had a terrible thing happen, or who has caused a terrible thing to happen, getting lost in the Outer Rim is a very appealing prospect. A new identity and a ship can go a long way towards making enough of a change in a life to make it hard for others to learn the truth. Such a Smuggler may be hiding from Bounty Flunters, or even the Empire itself. Then again, he may simply be hiding from himself and the sins of his past. • The Inheritance: When Smugglers die, they of­ ten have little left to leave anyone, save the most important thing in their life. A child, cousin, or even just a dear friend may one day find a legal agent at the door, saying “Sign here." Suddenly, he has a ship full of navigation points and records of regular customers. Fie also has a collection agent for some shady character informing him of all the debts attached to the ship and the need for certain activities to continue. Time to find a pi­ lot and learn to get over his hyperspace sickness. • The Search: Out there, somewhere in the Outer Rim, a certain something or someone calls to the Smuggler. He started out just flying from system to system, searching to no avail. Eventually, he had to start taking on cargo and passengers in order to make ends meet and keep the ship go- MARRIED TO THEIR SHIPS M ore so than other characters, Smugglers tend to have intimate relationships with their starships. Sometimes, like sailors of old, Smugglers are said to be "married to their ships." After all. a Smuggler can’t do much smuggling if he can’t climb out of a planet’s gravity well and jump to light speed! Since a Smuggler's starship is often the most important relationship in his or her life, it’s not uncommon for a Smuggler to refer to the ship as if it were a person. To most male Smugglers, his starship is “she," as in “she’ll make point five past light speed!" Female Smugglers, of course, commonly do the opposite. A Smuggler’s star- ship usually has an exciting, unique name, something meaningful to her captain. She may or may not be heavily customized and exoti- cally decorated. A Smuggler’s fondness for his or her ship sometimes extends to blindness when it comes to a ship’s failings. A stubborn hyperdrive “has character." Unreliable ship systems are a result of a ship “that just needs to be treated like a lady.” Stubborn loyalty to his or her chosen vessel is almost as much a defining characteris­ tic of Smugglers as a willingness to circumvent galactic shipping laws. Every Smuggler knows, however, that if you treat your ship right, she’ll take care of you. ing. Now he’s fully invested in the Smuggler way of life, but he has never given up his search. • The Loss: Perhaps it was an accident, or may­ be it was an attack. Regardless of the source, all hands were lost, including the one he loved the most. Blacklisted from ever flying among the Core Worlds again, he got as far away as he could from everyone and everything that reminded him of what happened. Eventually, his skills became a useful commodity among folks who either didn't know or didn’t care, and he was flying again. He was doing a lot more than that, learning tricks and talents that an Imperial pilot doesn’t tend to pick up. He’s a different person now, but he'll never forget what happened.

THE TECHNICIAN T echnicians are both knowledgeable and handy, and their skills show it: Astrogation, Computers, Co­ ordination, Discipline, Knowledge (Outer Rim), Mechanics, Perception, and Piloting (Planetary) He automatically gains one rank in four of these skills (of his choosing) without spending experience, and he receives a discount when he spends experience to purchase ranks in any of these skills. THE TECHNICIAN'S ROLE Pretty much anything to do with technology or me­ chanical devices lies within the Technician's purview. He knows how to operate, maintain, repair, and upgrade just about anything with power or gears. Most Techni­ cians would rather deal with machines and droids than people; the latter are just too unpredictable. Technicians can be found almost anywhere, at any tier of societv or in any location where there’s even a few machines. Formality—even cleanli­ ness—tends to fall far outside their daily concerns. They usually smell of some kind of grease, solvent, or other substance that's used on machines, and even their cleanest clothes are seldom free from stains. Even those Technicians that move among the higher echelons come off as rum­ pled and slouching; it's just not in their nature to put on a professional front. They let their work speak for itself. Note that Technicians do have a sense of pride, and it resides in the work they perform. If a Tech­ nician brings someone a piece of tech that he’s not only repaired but upgraded with some very useful modifications, the reac­ tion of the recipient can make or break his entire day. This is why Technicians tend to gravitate to one another socially, or bond with someone who has an ap­ preciation for machinery. Gadgeteer- oriented Bounty Hunters and Smug­ glers are most likely to befriend a Technician in a group. This can be a mutually beneficial rela­ tionship, considering all of the wonderful things a technically proficient individual can do for someone’s gear. Like Pilots and Doctors, Technicians of almost any specialization will have a relatively easy time finding work in the Outer Rim. Every operation, from small farmsteads to large space stations, has need of those who can keep the tech running. Criminal overlords particularly enjoy having a Technician on their payroll, not only to take care of their many assets, but also to craft the occasional "toy” for them with which to surprise their enemies. TECHNICIAN SPECIALIZATIONS The three specialization paths for the Technician are briefly discussed, giving an overall context in relation to the career. MECHANIC-MAKING STUFF WORK Depending on who is asked, Mechanics are either the glue that holds everything together or the grease that makes it all go. Most Mechanics would tell you they do both, and then get back to work. The additional career skills of a Mechanic indicate his practical versatility: Brawl, Mechanics (of course, and this gives him the opportunity to have two start­ ing ranks in the skill), Piloting (Space), and Skuldug­ gery If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Pragmatic and tough are two key traits that come out of a Mechanic's talent tree, as are the many ways he is capable of fixing what’s broken and being prepared for any mechanical contingencies that arise. While it is relatively easy to find a Mechanic almost anywhere in the galaxy, it’s considerably more diffi­ cult to find a good one, and even harder to find one that can be trusted. Ship captains will literally travel across systems to get to a Mechanic they can trust to do a good job for them, which is why Mechanics tend to be in high demand. A Mechanic that’s hooked up with the typical Player Character group has likely decided he doesn’t want to spend all of his time in a work pit or engineering han­ gar. He probably wants to see a bit of the galaxy and get some flight time in. Fortunately, Mechanics tend to pick up a few things about how to take care of them­ selves in tough situations, and given a few minutes and some random devices, they may well cobble together a rather explosive means of dealing with real problems. OUTLAW TECH-MAKING THINGS BETTER Outlaw Techs are the specialists others call on when they want something out of the ordinary. A blaster that works beyond factory tolerances? No problem. A transponder that identifies a smuggler’s freighter as a religious pilgrimage craft? It’ll cost a few credits, but sure. A protocol droid altered to carry out an assas­ sination? Just how big is that credit line, anyway? The Outlaw Tech adds the following to his available career skills Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Un­ derworld), Mechanics, and Streetwise. If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. This gives him the oppor­ tunity to have two starting ranks in Mechanics, if he also chooses that as one of his free starting career skill ranks. With his talents, the Outlaw Tech is adept at doing fan­ tastic things with technology that he probably shouldn’t. He’s also tough, clever, and adaptable. Outlaw Techs find the Outer Rim very comfort­ able. They’re able to practice their unique style of work with far less chance of running afoul of Imperial agents or other repressive government restrictions. They also find it far easier to make the contacts and get the kinds of customers that really appreciate their services. Of course, it’s a lot harder to get true state- of-the-art equipment, but making do with what’s on hand is a specialty of the Outlaw Tech. Outlaw Techs in a Player Character group will be highly prized, especially for their ability to make all kinds of improvements on other characters’ gear. They are also adept at keeping ships and vehicles op­ erational, and in some situations, they’re as handy at acquiring certain goods as some Explorers. Without a Smuggler in the group, an Outlaw Tech may be the best bet for dealing with the local black markets. SLICER-MAKING THE DATA FLOW For the Slicer, a computer or datapad is just a puzzle to solve with prizes for doing so. “Slicing” is the term used for the invasive efforts to steal or alter data in a system. With practically the entire galaxy wired to computerized systems, Slicers are extremely valuable people to know, and dangerous to cross. Slicers naturally tend towards the underworld, yet they are also highly intelligent and knowledgeable. They add these skills to their career skills: Comput­ ers, Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Under­ world), and Stealth If this is the character’s starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending start­ ing experience. Their talents mainly focus on making computerized and electronic systems dance to their tune. Slicers are among the most valued professionals in the Outer Rim, especially to the criminal world A Slicer’s worth, however, is only as good as his reputa­ tion; success and loyalty will earn him top credits, while blowing key operations or double-crossing an employ­ er will tend to make his prospects far less attractive. A Player Character group without a Slicer will have something of a handicap, especially where acquir­ ing data or handling computerized problems is con­ cerned. A Slicer might join a group for a chance to get away from a bad deal, or simply because he’s ready to see the next planet. Slicers tend to be a quirky bunch, so there might be any number of motivations at work. TECHNICIAN STORIES The skills of a good Technician are always in demand, both in the Core Worlds and in the Outer Rim. Given that fact, it’s no surprise that most Technicians live fairly quiet and simple lives, acting as engineers or re­ pair techs, either in their own workshops or employed by a corporation or cartel. Of course, some Techni­ cians—the sort most likely to become Player Charac­ ters—just can’t live that kind of life. Either they can’t settle for anything that humble, or they’ve got some troubles in their past that force them to keep moving. Some examples include: • M ad Genius: It's not the Technician’s fault if no one understands his genius. Granted they just asked for cooling condensers, but an arctic envi­ ronment generator accomplishes so much more! A mad genius Technician probably has one or more misunderstandings in his past. He finds bu­ reaucracy stifling (especially all the paperwork one must fill out after a moderate-sized explo­ sion that might happen to eradicate a city block) and chafes at regulations or anyone trying to limit his genius. He must keep moving and continue searching for the perfect opportunity to display his genius, not to mention exciting new things to stimulate his curiosity and puzzles to solve. • Scavenger: A Technician born and raised in the Outer Rim may have never seen a new machine fresh from the factory. He works strictly with sec­ ond-hand stuff, some of it decades or even centu­ ries old. The good ones can take old, broken-down machines and cobble together anything one could want, creating amazing, one-of-a-kind inventions that can never be replicated. Scavengers are always on the lookout for interesting new pieces of scrap to play with, and on the Outer Rim, there’s always new scrap. There’s also old scrap, sometimes very old scrap indeed, from civilizations long dead that could be extremely valuable to all the wrong people. • Sentimental: Some Technicians get attached to one particular machine, perhaps a droid or a star- ship. Maybe it’s a design they find fascinating, or maybe it’s a machine they’ve known all their lives. For whatever reason, the Technician can’t help but keep tinkering, always making small improve­ ments to the machine and keeping it in top shape. People may come and go, die or betray you, but the machine...it’s a constant. • Secret Blueprints: Some Technicians come into possession of knowledge that can be downright dangerous. For some, it’s information they stole or stumbled across, schematics for a secret su­ perweapon or illegal technology. For others, it’s a machine whose construction and design may have been their life’s work up until its comple­ tion...until their employer decided to shut the project down, and with it all loose ends. These Technicians find that a life on the run is the only option, always trying to keep one step ahead of the corporate or Empire or underworld thugs who seek to do them in, always trying to find some way to turn that knowledge that’s such a huge li­ ability into an asset. DROID COMPANIONS AND FAVORITE TOYS T he loyal droid companion is a common ele­ ment in Star Wars stories, and the Technician character is a perfect opportunity to include one. Of course, most droid prices are well out­ side the budget of a starting character, even af­ ter accepting additional starting Obligation. Still, a Game Master may choose to add a plucky as- tromech or easily-flustered protocol droid to the Technician’s list of assets. Such a droid would be an NPC controlled by the game master, and an opportunity for the GM to insert his or her own voice into PC discussions. Technician PCs who wish to consider a PC droid as their personal droid companion are advised to discuss it with that droid’s player beforehand. Droids aren’t the only pieces of advanced technology that Technicians might wish to customize heavily. A Slicer PC might have a tricked-out datapad, a mechanic may have a lovingly-customized starship, and an Outlaw Tech...well, there's no limit to what they might choose to modify! Technician players who are interested in customized technology should read the relevant sections of Chapter V: Gear and Equipment and Chapter VII: Starships and Vehicles carefully.

Spend I Destiny Point to ignore effects of Critical Injuries on Intellect or Cunning checks until end o f encounter. Gain + 1 to a single charac­ teristic. This cannot bring a characteristic above 6. STEP 6: INVEST EXPERIENCE POINTS E xperience is the primary means by which players customize their characters. Each player starts with a beginning pool of experience points that can be used to improve aspects of his character. Players also re­ ceive additional experience as they play Edge of the Empire, which can be spent to improve their characters. STARTING EXPERIENCE POINTS Characters begin with a budget of experience points based on their species. The experience points used during character creation are the same as experience points received during play. If a player chooses to spend fewer experience points during character cre­ ation than his budget, those points carry over into the game and the Player Character starts with more ex­ perience points to spend once his adventures begin. Players may spend experience points in the following primary ways to improve their characters. These are also detailed on Table 2 -4 : Spending Starting Experience NEED MORE EXPERIENCE? R emember, a player can always increase his character’s starting experience by taking on additional Obligation as described under Starting Obligation on page 40. IMPROVING CHARACTERISTICS During character creation, raising a characteristic to the next highest rating costs ten times the value it is being raised to. For example, raising a character's Brawn from 3 to 4 would require 40 experience points. TABLE 2-4: SPENDING STARTING EXPERIENCE Each improvement must be purchased separately. This means that raising a character’s Brawn from 3 to 5 would cost 90 experience points (40 for raising it from 3 to 4, then 50 more for raising it from 4 to 5). During character creation, no characteristic can be increased higher than 5. During the course of play, no characteristic can be increased higher than 6. Char­ acteristics may only be purchased with experience points during character creation, not at any later time (During gameplay, characteristics can be increased by purchasing specific talents, however). SKILL TRAINING Each skill has five ranks of training available. A char­ acter may have already acquired several ranks of skill training from his starting career and profession for free. Characters may train additional skills and gain additional ranks during character creation. However, it is important to note that, regardless of any species or career bonuses, no skill can be raised higher than rank 2 during character creation. The cost for training skills falls into one of two cat­ egories—career skills and non-career skills. The char­ acter should have check marks next to a number of skills based on his starting career and profession. Training a career skill to the next highest rank costs five times the rank it is being raised to. For example, training a career skill from rank 0 (untrained) to rank 1 requires 5 experience points. Improving a rank 1 career skill to rank 2 requires 10 experience points. Each rank must be purchased separately. This means that acquir­ ing a rank 2 career skill during creation costs 15 experi­ ence points (5 for raising it from zero to rank 1, then 10 more for raising it from rank 1 to rank 2).

A character can also purchase ranks of non-career skills. Each rank of a non-career skill costs 5 additional experience points. For ex­ ample, training a non-career skill from rank 0 (untrained) to rank 1 requires 10 experience points. Improving a rank 1 non-career skill to rank 2 requires 15 experience points. Each rank must be purchased separately. This means that acquiring a rank 2 non-career skill during creation costs 25 experi­ ence points (10 for raising it from zero to rank 1, then 15 more for raising it from rank 1 to rank 2). Characters may purchase ranks in skills during character creation or later during gameplay. ACQUIRING TALENTS Talents are acquired from a character’s avail­ able talent trees, generally provided by their specialization choices. Talent trees provide a unique format for purchasing talents that comes with several special rules and restrictions. Each specialization talent tree has four columns and five rows. This means each talent tree has a total of twenty tal­ ents that characters may purchase. The cost of each talent depends on the row it occupies. The talents in the topm ost row are the cheapest, costing 5 experience points each. The next row’s choices cost 10 experience points each, the third row costs 1 5, the fourth row costs 20, and the fifth and final row’s choices costs 25 experience points each. Note that the choices on each tree are connected by a series of lines that link some talent choices with oth­ ers. Characters may only purchase talents for which they are eligible. Characters are eligible to select any talents in the first, topmost row, plus any talents that are connected via one of the aforementioned links to a talent the character has already acquired. When selecting talents on a specialization tree, remember that each selection on the tree may only be purchased once. In the case of ranked talents (talents that may be purchased multiple times, and have effects that stack the more times they are pur­ chased), the only way to purchase them multiple times is if there are m ultiple selections of the same talent on the available specialization trees. In some cases, a character may have already acquired a talent in one specialization, but need to purchase it again in another specialization in order to reach further into the tree. If it is a ranked talent, he must purchase it again (gaining another rank in the talent). If it is not a ranked talent, he counts as already having pur­ chased it, and may proceed through the sec­ ond specialization tree. Characters may purchase talents during character creation or later dur­ ing gameplay. ACQUIRING NEW SPECIALIZATIONS Each character starts with a single specialization within his chosen career. However, he may pur­ chase access to additional spe­ cializations. Purchasing a specialization is basically the character buying the ability to purchase talents within that specialization. In addition, each specialization has career skills. These skills now count as career skills for the charac­ ter (although he does not gain free advances in them, as he did with his first special­ ization). Characters may purchase any specialization in any career. Purchasing an additional specializa­ tion within a character’s career costs 10 t i m e s the total number of specializations he would possess with this new specialization. So a character with one specialization could purchase a second ca­ reer specialization for 20 experience. If he wished to purchase a third career specialization, it would cost 30 experience. Characters may also purchase additional specializa­ tions outside of their career. Purchasing non-career specializations costs 10 times the total number of specializations he would possess with this new spe­ cialization, plus an additional 10 experience. So a character with one specialization could purchase a second non-career specialization for 30 experience. If he had two specializations already, a third specializa­ tion that was also a non-career specialization would cost 40 experience. STEP 7: DETERMINING DERIVED ATTRIBUTES S ome attributes of a character are derived from a player's other choices during character creation. W O UND THRESHOLD A character’s wound threshold is, basically, how many wounds—physical damage—a character can withstand before he is knocked out. A character’s starting wound threshold is determined by adding his species’ wound threshold to his Brawn rating (after spending start­ ing XP). After determining this initial value, further in­ creases to a character’s Brawn rating do not increase his wound threshold—wound threshold improvements are acquired by purchasing talents such as Toughened. STRAIN THRESHOLD A character’s strain threshold determines how much strain—psychological and mental damage—a charac­ ter can withstand before he is stunned, dazed, or in­ capacitated. A character’s starting strain threshold is determined by adding his species’ strain threshold to his Willpower rating (after spending starting XP). After determining this initial value, further increases to a character’s Willpower rating do not increase his strain threshold—strain threshold improvements are ac­ quired by purchasing appropriate talents, such as Grit. DEFENSE Defense determines how difficult a character is to hit in combat situations. Defense is divided into ranged defense and melee defense. A character’s default val­ ue in each defense rating is zero. Defense is most commonly gained by wearing ar­ mor, or by adopting a defensive position in combat (such as gaining cover). Some talents may also in­ crease one of the character's defense ratings. SOAK VALUE Soak value determines how much incoming dam­ age a character can shrug off before being seriously wounded. A character’s soak value is subtracted from any incoming damage. Any remaining damage after subtracting soak becomes wounds, and is applied to­ wards the character’s wound threshold. A character’s default soak value is equal to his Brawn rating. After determining this initial value, in­ creases to a character’s Brawn rating increase his soak value. Additional soak value is most often gained by wearing armor. Some talents may also increase a character's innate soak value, such as Enduring. Later increases to Brawn rating also increase soak. STEP 8: DETERMINE MOTIVATIONS n character’s Motivation helps provide flavor and dis­ tinction by helping define what makes him “tick” and what distinguishes two PCs with the same race, class, and skill mix. In the same way that Obligation gives characters a series of concrete goals they need to resolve (and provides GMs with concepts for ad­ ventures), Motivation is intended to help a player roleplay his character by giving him some predeter­ mined character traits and goals, making the charac­ ter more fully developed and more interesting to play. During character creation, a player may either roll on Table 2 -5 : Random Motivation to determine his character’s primary Motivation, or with the GM’s per­ mission, he may create his own. Once the character’s primary Motivation has been determined, the player then rolls on the appropriate table to determine a spe­ cific Motivation. Several players may choose to have their characters share Motivations with each other, and develop back-stories or relationships between the characters in the group. The GM should remind players that while many Motivations may go hand-in- hand with the character’s Obligation, they are by no means limited to tying the two together. While Obligation has very concrete effects on gameplay, Motivation is more focused on the role- playing and narrative aspects of the game. For more on Motivation and how it’s used in play, see Chapter IX: The Came Master TABLE 2-5: RANDOM MOTIVATION dlO Motivation Result 1-3 A m bition 4-6 Cause 7-9 Relationship 10 Roll once on each o f any tw o categories TABLE 2-6: SPECIFIC AMBITIONS d100 Result 01-10 Friendship: The character seeks to be liked by others and goes o u t o f his way to make a good impression. He may or may not be gregarious, relying on his actions and deeds to foster friendship. 11-20 Love: The character is driven by love o r intimacy. The character already has a true love o r strives to find the one he is meant to be with. 21-30 Freedom: The character desires the freedom to do w hat he wants. This could be a passion to overcome one or more of his current Obligations o r to see others freed from the shackles of bondage and servitude in all its forms. 31-40 Fame: The character seeks the lim elight and wants to be famous. He wants his deeds and actions to make the HoloN et for all to see and revels in the attention given by fans and supporters. 41-50 Creed: M oney is the prime m otivator for this character. The character may be active in business, investing, o r the tried- and-true m ethod o f theft to increase his credit bank. 51-60 Status: The character wants to elevate his social standing—gaining titles, commendations, and accolades. The character may come from humble beginnings o r otherwise strive for a higher position than where he began. 61-70 Expertise: The character wants to excel in his chosen profession and constantly practices to achieve perfection. Alternatively, this character picks a skill o r two in which to excel. 71-80 W anderlust / Novelty: The character is driven to explore the galaxy and rarely stays in one place for long. He's motivated to uncover remote o r unexplored regions and seeing everything that can be seen. Alternatively, this character is driven to experience new sensations and activities, perhaps rather hedonistically. 81-90 Power: The character craves power and au thority over others. His rule may not be despotic, b u t he wants to control his situation and those around him, often bettering himself in the process. 91-00 Religion/Spirituality: The character is both drawn and follows the sway of a particular religious o r spiritual calling. This could be the tenets o f the Jedi o r the Sith o r some other belief. TYPES OF MOTIVATION In Edge of the Empire, the three broadest categories of Motivation are Ambition, Cause, and Relationship. As stated previously, the player may roll on this table dur­ ing character creation to determine his character's Mo­ tivation or, with the GM’s permission, choose or make up a new Motivation for his character. Once the player determines the category for his Motivation, he rolls once on that category’s table to determine the specifics. AMBITION A character with this Motivation is driven by a specific goal. This Motivation is internal and often abstract, and possibly selfish in nature. A character with the Ambition Motivation wants to better himself in some way—gaining love, status, power, or spiritual knowl­ edge, for example. The player should determine the character’s ultimate goal and why he does things the way that he does to get there. TABLE 2-7: SPECIFIC CAUSES d100 Result 01-10 Religion/Spirituality: The character actively supports some religious o r spiritual organization o r belief. This could include the tenets o f the Jedi o r Sith codes o r some o th e r belief. 11-20 The W eak / Charity: The character fights for the underdog, disliking bullies and totalitarianism He'll put the interests of those in need before his own and may donate tim e o r money to aid the less fortunate 21-30 Non-Hum an Rights: The character fights for the rights o f non-humans in the very xenophobic rule o f the Empire. 31-40 Local Politics: The character supports some particular political cause, typically within a single planet o r system The character actively gets involved in campaigns and candidates, and may even fight on the behalf o f a political organization 41-50 Overthrow the Empire: The character despises the Empire and everything that it stands for He may o r may not be an active member o f the Rebellion, but he supports its goals and gives aid and com fort to those against Imperial tyranny 51-60 Crime: The character supports the idea o f black markets, mercenaries, and other groups th a t fall outside o f the law. The character need not be a crim inal himself, but may give aid to other criminals, especially if they are fam ily members, childhood friends, o r if corruption is deeply imbedded in the character’s originating culture 61-70 Emancipation: The character sees slavery and indentured servitude as an abom ination that m ust be undone. He'll go out o f his way to aid o r a tte m p t to free anyone kept in slavery 71-80 Droid Rights: The character believes th a t droids should be accepted as full members of galactic society, not merely tools o r servants. 81-90 Capitalism: The character is an unabashed capitalist and fights for the rights o f merchants, trading organizations, and business, sometimes running counter to the wishes of both the Empire and some crim inal groups. 91-00 Support th e Empire: The character actually supports the goals and methods o f the Empire and does his best to advance its cause. He’ll defend the Empire in conversation and may actively take up arms in its defense.

This could be a specific planet, town, space station, or ship The character strives to be tter the place o f origin and its people and will defend it with his life. 11-20 Pet: The character is close w ith a pet o r animal com panion o f some sort, a relatively small non-combatant. 21-30 C hildh ood F riend: The character maintains ties with a friend from his childhood Although the two may be a galaxy apart, the character desires only the best for his companion. 31-40 C om rades: The character shows loyalty to those he serves alongside. This could be either the current group o f PCs, former m ilitary buddies, or business associates. 41-50 S ib ling/S ibling s: The character has one o r more siblings w ith whom he maintains close contact. The sibling or siblings are unlikely to be com batants and this M otivation may o r may not fall in line with a character's Relationship Obligation 51 -60 M e n to r: The character is particularly close to a mentor, professor, teacher or other figure that provided support, knowledge, and wisdom to him in his early years. 61-70 P arents: The character has close ties w ith his parents (or a single parent) and seeks their constant approval This may or may not be a healthy o r supportive situation. 71-80 E xtended Fam ily/C lan: The character has a large extended family, clan, o r tribe that he deeply loves. He seeks both their com fort and approval despite the many voices clam oring in his ear for attention 81-90 D ro id C om panion: The character possesses a fondness for a particular droid. This could be a form er family servant, his ship's astromech droid, o r his trusty protocol droid This may include a PC droid. 91-00 F orm er N em esis: The character formed a close bond with a form er nemesis o r rival. Although things are patched between them, the two could still be extrem ely competitive. CAUSE Where the Ambition Motivation deals with an internal drive, the Cause Motivation is typically an external group or concept on which the character focuses. The Motiva­ tion is something so important that the character is will­ ing to takes risks or operate outside his comfort zone. Although this Motivation focuses on the needs of others, belief in a cause need not be altruistic by nature or for the common good—the cause could support some te­ nets that are dangerous or harmful to others, in fact. RELATIONSHIP This M otivation focuses on a character’s rela­ tionship with a specific person, creature, or even place. The relationship could be loving, respectful, and nurturing or antagonistic, competitive, or one­ sided. The character looks out for the subject's best interests and will set aside his own needs to help when needed. This M otivation could be deep­ ly personal or highly public. MOTIVATIONS IN PLAY Players should use a character’s Motivation as a simple guide for how he interacts with the world. A character with the Ambition (Creed) Motivation views things in a far different manner than someone with the Relationship (Comrades) Motiva­ tion, for instance. Each Motivation is just that, however—a guide, not a restriction—and different situations may call for different actions. Not every deed a character performs needs to be driven by his Motivation, but he should attem pt to do so generally. CALLING ON MOTIVATIONS If a player finds himself at a loss as to what his charac­ ter should do in a given situation, the CM can look up his Motivation and provide incentive for him to act by providing "bait" that’s appropriate to the Motivation. For example, a character with the Ambition (Power) Motiva­ tion might be presented with an opportunity to usurp some authority for himself in some small way; someone with the Cause (The Weak/Charity) Motivation could stumble across some helpless NPC that he feels inspired to help. The CM may determine that the character’s Motivation would push him to succeed in certain situations and reward the play­ er with beneficial bonuses for taking certain actions that are ROLEPLAYINB MOTIVATION REWARDS P layers can receive rewards for staying true to their Motivation, just as they can with good roleplaying. These rewards are ultimately up the GM, and generally come in the form of additional experience points. More on this can be found in Chapter IX: The Came Master, on page 311. in character with his Motivation. However, these aspects of Motivation are covered in more detail in the Chapter IX: The Came Master on page 311. CHANGING MOTIVATIONS Just as in real life, a character’s Motivation may change over time. Something could happen to the ob­ ject of the character’s Motivation, such as the death of a teacher in the case of the Relationship (Mentor) Motivation or the destruction of the character’s home planet for the Cause (Local Politics) Motivation. In these instances, the player should decide if his character sticks to his original Motivation (possibly out of loyalty, the need for revenge, or the desire to continue with the subject’s legacy) or if he changes his Motivation entirely. The player should not determine a new Motiva­ tion randomly and instead should work with the GM to come up with the character’s new Motivation. Even over the course of a long-running campaign, changing a char­ acter’s Motivation should be a rare event. If the character changes his Motivation during a cam­ paign, he should not receive any bonus experience points for his previous Motivation and should be required to demonstrate his commitment to his new Motivation. SECRET MOTIVATIONS Once all the players have determined their charac­ ter’s Motivations, the GM should note them and keep them handy as a reference as the campaign progresses. However, a player does not have to tell the other play­ ers his character’s Motivation. Some of the Motivations listed above might come with some inherent dangers, social damage, or chance of corruption that might run counter to the party’s overall goals. This is intentional, as sometimes keeping a character’s Motivation secret might make things hard for the group, but is excellent for creating tension and good roleplaying. If a character chooses to keep his Motivation secret he can, with the GM’s permission, roll a second time to provide the character’s "false front." The player should be encouraged to give the appearance of act­ ing on behalf of the false Motivation, while actually furthering the goals of the original. E X AM PLE: PLAYING TO M O TIV A TIO N S Jim rolls on the tables and comes up with the re­ sult of Cause (Support the Empire) for his Politico character. Obviously, many of the other charac­ ters in the group would find this Motivation dis­ tasteful or even dangerous. The GM allows Jim to roll a second time, coming up with the Relation­ ship (Sibling/Siblings) result. Outwardly, Jim’s character should appear motivated to assist one or more of his siblings. However, in truth, the character wants to support the Empire. He could use his false Motivation as a cover, taking “visits to see his family” as a way to get away from pry­ ing eyes and doing something that furthers the goals of the Empire. STEP 9: GEAR AND APPEARANCE n t this stage, the players have taken care of most of the mechanical details of their characters. Now each player has the chance to consider additional de­ tails that help define his character. These details tend to have a greater narrative impact on how the char­ acters operate and add richness and depth to their existence. This means, however, that players are able (and even encouraged) to be as creative as they like when inventing the description of their character. STARTING GEAR Player Characters in Edge of the Empire receive a bud­ get of credits to spend on starting gear before game- play begins. This budget is 500 credits, although it can be increased by undertaking additional Obliga- SHORT ON CASH? R emember, a player can always increase his character's starting credits by taking on ad­ ditional Obligation as described under Start­ ing Obligation on page 40. tion (see page 40). Before their characters begin the game, players may spend these credits to pur­ chase items from Chapter V for their character. They may not purchase Restricted (R) items unless specifi­ cally given dispensation by their GM. Characters keep any unspent credits when they start the game. In addition, once the player has fin­ ished spending his starting credits, he rolls 1 d 100. His character gains this many additional credits as “pocket money" at the beginning of the game. This additional money may not be spent during character creation. Characters do not start the game with any items save what they purchase with their starting credits or any miscellaneous sundries they feel are appropriate for their character (see page 180). PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION The appearance of characters in Edge of the Empire can vary wildly. Player Characters may stem from a variety of alien species, and even amongst an indi­ vidual species, different characters may be wildly divergent. When determining their characters’ physical ap­ pearance, players should start by reviewing the infor­ mation presented about the species they chose. The physiological aspects of Gand, for example, are ex­ tremely different from those of a Wookiee. Likewise, if a player has taken the role of a Droid, he may have no particular restrictions on how he looks at all. With his character’s species’ traits in mind, a player can then consider what physical details he wants to embellish. The following is a list that, while not ap­ plicable for all species, is intended to give a broad overview of what the player should consider. • Height, weight, and build: A character’s physi­ cal build is primarily determined by his species; humans tend to range between 1.5 to 2 meters tall, while Wookiees are often far taller (2.2 meters on average). However, even within the norms of a species, there is a great deal of variation. Players should endeavor to keep their characters’ builds within reasonable limits, of course—a 5 meter tall Twi’lek would be absurd enough to fall outside the realms of believability. But within those limits, players are free to choose whether their characters appear thin, fat, muscular, tall, short, or any com­ bination thereof. If players like, they can also tailor their physical appearances to match their physical characteristics, Agility and Brawn. • Hair and eye color: Not all species in the galaxy have hair, or even eyes (or at least eyes that are recognized as such). Sometimes this even varies amongst species. Rodian males, for example, do not have hair, but Rodian females do. However, amongst those species who do have variations in eye and hair color, almost infinite variations are possible. Humans, in particular, tend to sport al­ most any hair or eye color imaginable, whether due to the vagaries of their home world or even artificial modifications. • Skin, scale, or fur color: Some of the species in Edce of the Empire tend to have fairly consistent coloration. Wookiees tend to be brown or black, Trandoshan scales are typically brownish-green in varying shades, and Rodians are almost always green. Other species have wider fluctuations. Twi'lek skin colors fluctuate from albino white to green, blue, and even yellow, and Humans can be found in almost as wide a variety of hues. • Scars, tattoos, and other identifying marks: This is where players can get especially creative, as such marks are not bound by a species’ norms. Players should consider coming up with stories for the origins of these brands, or work them into an existing backstory. PERSONALITY A character’s personality is another place where play­ ers can really get creative. Traits, quirks, habits, likes and dislikes—players can be as thorough or as con­ cise as they wish. One good starting point for developing a personal­ ity is to look at the character’s Motivations and Ob­ ligation. They could even be the inspiration to create someone with a completely different personality. An honorable, honest person torn because of his Obliga­ tions to criminal enterprise is a classic trope. Alternatively, another good way to develop a per­ sonality for a character is to let it evolve over time. Sometimes the best character personalities develop over the course of the game, based on the decisions the player makes most naturally. Don’t be afraid to leave a character with room to grow. As part of their Obligation, each group starts the game with a starship. This is the final part of character cre­ ation. The GM can choose one of these three ships as his group's starter vessel. Alternatively, experienced groups can select their own ship, so long as that ship costs no more than 120,000 credits and is approved by the GM. All three of these starting ships are selected to perform different roles. The Wayfarer is primarily a cargo hauler, but reasonably modifiable. The YT-1300 is even more modifiable, making it the most flexible option for a group. The Firespray is probably the most dangerous ship, but also the least modifiable of the three. It’s also fairly lim­ ited in the tasks it can perform. More on these, and other ships can be found in Chapter VII WAYFARER MEDIUM TRANSPORT This ship is good for larger groups, as it has ample room for crew, passengers, and lots of cargo. It’s a larger and less maneuverable vessel, so it can’t easily mix it up with starfighters. Groups with an enthusiastic and dedicated pilot character may want to look else­ where. Flowever, groups that just need a tough ship that can haul cargo, explore the galaxy, and take a beating should consider the Wayfarer (page 263). Y T-1300 LIGHT FREIGHTER One of the most common light freighters in the galaxy, the YT-1300 certainly pushed Corellian Engineering Corporation into center stage. The YT-1300 is quick, rugged, and almost endlessly modifiable. Besides being identifiably iconic, the YT-1300 (page 264) is a good starship to start groups off with be­ cause it can perform well in a variety of roles. It can haul cargo, or with some modifications, can be upgunned or hot-rodded into a smuggling or bounty hunting vessel. FIRESPRAY SYSTEM PATROL CRAFT The Firespray (page 255) was considered a revolu­ tionary design in patrol craft when first constructed during the waning years of the Old Republic, and is a good choice for smaller groups looking to pursue ca­ reers in bounty hunting or enforcement (and perhaps piracy). The ship has tough armor and powerful drives, and starts out with a relatively potent weaponry load- out. Flowever, its small size makes it a poor choice for moving cargo. STEP 10: SELECTING A SHIP T he vast majority of a character’s actions are gov­ erned by abilities that he has learned through edu­ cation or experience. Any time he attempts an action which has a reasonable chance of success or failure, his skills come into play as a means of determining the result. In some instances, the task may be so triv­ ial or the character so capable that the Game Master may not call for a check. Other times, the task is so outlandish that the player might choose to act differ­ ently once the odds are calculated. Ultimately, when there is a reasonable chance of failure, the player must depend upon his character’s skills to see him through to success. Skill values fulfill this role in conjunction with char­ acteristics. These two values interact to directly es­ tablish the Ability and Proficiency dice used when attempting any action. A character’s innate abilities are generally described by characteristics, while skills require learning and practice. In this way, the intersec­ tion of education and natural ability contributes to a character’s chances of success or failure. WHAT ARE SKILLS? Anything that a character might learn could be con­ sidered a skill. The galaxy is a vast place, however, and not everything a person might learn has applica­ tions that fit well within a dramatic game. To reflect this, Edge of the Empire includes a list of skills that are most likely to come up in the course of dramatic ad­ ventures set within the Star Wars galaxy. The list may not cover every imaginable situation, but it should ad­ dress those that are most likely to come up during the course of a game session. Skills are divided into three categories based upon their general application and use. Knowledge skills are entirely cerebral. They do not govern action—only un­ derstanding. Combat skills deal with how a character may act and react in a direct physical confrontation. Other skills may be useful during an altercation, but combat skills can seldom be used without violence. All skills that deal with characters taking non-combat actions are considered General skills. SKILLS "Do or do not. There is no try." -M aster Yoda SKILL RANKS Every time a character prepares to check for an ac­ tion, he begins by forming a dice pool. The higher value of the relevant characteristic or skill is used to determine the total number of A bility dice. The smaller of these two values indicates how many of those dice are upgraded to Proficiency dice. A char­ acter who has no ranks in a skill is considered un­ skilled. This character has a value of 0 for the skill in question, so would make checks using that skill w ith­ out upgrading any Ability dice to Proficiency dice. Aside from the game terms, it may also be useful to consider what skill ranks represent in a more narrative sense. Even a single rank in a skill represents a signifi­ cant amount of time spent learning and practicing its use. It is generally reasonable to assume that other characters in the game world rely heavily upon their characteristics for actions outside their field of exper­ tise. For example, almost everyone can pilot a speed­ er in routine traffic, but most people do not have a rank of Piloting (Planetary). Instead, they default to using their Agility characteristic for the routine tasks. Each rank of a skill represents a substantial degree of training and practice. Further, that practice must often come under strenuous conditions. A character who spends endless days performing the same task on a droid assembly line does not improve his Me­ chanics skill. However, if that same character were regularly working on a range of different droids that came for repairs after being exposed to harsh envi­ ronmental conditions, it is likely that he could soon improve his skill rank. The first two ranks of a skill represent someone who has a thorough grounding in a skill but little practical experience. Such a character may have just completed a formal education, be taking part in an apprentice­ ship, or have begun an entry level job. At this level of competency, he knows the basics of the skill but hardly realizes how little he knows. He may accomplish rou­ tine tasks, but is often overwhelmed by complex ones. The third and fourth ranks are indicative of a true professional. These are individuals who have honed the skill thoroughly and can make their living at it. They might be talented and capable physicians, respected pilots, or canny thieves. They are aware of how much more they have to learn, but capable of handling most tasks when they have prepared for them. Few individuals actually attain the fifth rank of a skill. Few can adequately appreciate the artistry of a master, so those who attain this level must deliberately chal­ lenge themselves to perfect their expertise. Characters with this degree of expertise may have a reputation for their particular talents that extends far beyond their community. These individuals are generally driven and passionate about the skill that they have mastered. SKILL DESCRIPTIONS This section details all of the skills used throughout a game. Each skill is presented with clarifications of how it may best be used, along with key differences from simi­ lar skills. In addition, examples are provided highlighting potential ways that a skill might use Advantages. Sometimes, through particular fortune, a character may roll more & than are needed to accomplish a task. Each entry presents ways that these additional & may be used. These are not necessary, but are in­ tended to add additional flavor. Game Masters and players are encouraged to work together to provide alternative ways that extra & might appropriately and dramatically modify a given situation. CUSTOM SKILLS A t the Game Master's discretion, new skills may be introduced to a campaign. The most com­ mon of these might pertain to Knowledges. The six Knowledge skills included represent a broad overview, but a campaign focused within a partic­ ular portion of the galaxy or on a particular style of play might benefit from alternative options. Similarly, games that focus on other aspects of Star Wars might also consider alternative general skills. If the Player Characters regularly visit worlds where beasts serve as the primary form of trans­ portation, then Animal Handling might be in or­ der. Alternatively, if the characters travel incognito as a troupe of actors, then Perform might be an appropriate skill. Before adding such skills, Game Masters should carefully consider whether the ad­ dition is critical for the campaign tone and how often it might come into play. Each new skill rank that a character needs to purchase represents XP that might have been spent on existing skills. When adding a new skill, the Game Master and players work together to decide which careers or specializations might offer it as a class skill. In some cases, it may be most effective to remove a standard skill from the list prior to adding a new skill so as to maintain comparable levels of flexi­ bility between archetypes. In other cases, a more generalized skill might be available to everyone at career skill pricing.

A mercenary must be able to use his weapon, a politician must be able to negotiate, and a pilot must be able to fly. This does not mean that ev­ ery character should maximize his core skills, but those who fail to at least take a rank are likely to regret it. Skills beyond that central focus must be chosen carefully. Skills related to a character’s profession are substantially more economical than those outside his career. Players who spread their characters too thinly at the early stages may discover that the sacrifices nec­ essary may not have been worthwhile. Routine uses do not generally require a dice roll. A retired ambassador may not need to be a talented pilot if he only uses his speeder for transport, and never for a high speed chase. At the same time, some skills are much more likely to come up during the course of a hero’s adventures. Injuries that require Medicine are common. In some situations, it can be critical to move with Stealth. Oth­ er times, a character’s life may depend upon his Vigi­ lance or Athletics. Often, it is in a group’s best interest to discuss skills collectively, so that the players and the Came Master have a shared expectation about how often particular skills may be used. GENERAL SKILLS T his group of skills represents the majority of the ac­ tions that a character attempts. In dramatic situa­ tions, the entire success or failure of a mission might ride on how effectively a given character uses one of these skills. While general skills do not govern violent actions, life and death may ride upon their effective use. ASTROGATION (INTELLECT) There are many billions of stars within the galaxy, all of which are in motion relative to one another. Planets and other smaller masses constantly orbit many of these stars. There are also huge numbers of nebulae and other astronomical anomalies. Travel­ ing between the worlds of the galaxy requires a rudi­ mentary knowledge of the galaxy’s organization and composition. It also requires a navicomputer that is well-informed as to the current time and the relative motion of all of these objects. The Astrogation skill represents a character’s ability to use his knowledge of the galaxy to most effectively program the hyper­ space coordinates for any jump. • Any time that a character wishes to program a navicomputer for a hyperspace jump, he must first use Astrogation to program the navicomputer. • Astrogation governs a character’s basic knowl­ edge of galactic geography. It may be checked any time a character wonders what other systems are nearby. • In the event characters arrive in an unknown sys­ tem, they may use a navicomputer and their As­ trogation skill to identify their location. • Astrogation also covers familiarity with the gal­ axy’s hyperspace routes and the types of craft and commerce most common along those routes. The difficulty of a hyperspace jump is based upon the area being targeted and the distance being trav­ eled. Travel to a nearby system along a well-estab­ lished route is generally an Easy (4 ) check, and the difficulty increases based on the accuracy of naviga­ tional information and other factors. See page 246 for more information on hyperspace travel. Additional # beyond those required to calculate a hyperspace jump may be used to better target the location. While a single net & reaches the tar­ get system w ithout incident, extras might place the character’s vessel directly into o rb it around the target planet. Alternatively, characters may use additional # to reduce the time spent calcu­ lating, when rushed. O rolled as part of an Astrogation check are most commonly used to reduce the travel time. On extend­ ed journeys, they might be used to identify conve­ nient stopovers en route, where the vessel can resup­ ply or conduct additional business to help defray the overall cost of the trip. A ($) could be spent to either complete Astrogation calculations in the minimum amount of time, or greatly reduce the travel time in­ volved. It could also reveal some highly valuable but previously unknown information, such as a much bet­ ter, alternative travel route. Likewise, <§> generated on an Astrogation check could decrease the accuracy or increase the travel time of a hyperspace jump, or simply cause a char­ acter to miss relevant details when analyzing hyper­ space routes or galactic maps. ^ can be spent in the same way but to greater magnitude, or it could trig­ ger something truly awful happening, such as jump­ ing out of hyperspace in the path of an asteroid. ATHLETICS (BRAWN) Player Characters lead dramatic lives, filled with con­ stant physical confrontations. Often that confronta­ tion comes from an enemy with a blaster, but some­ times it may be a mountain to be scaled, a river to be swum, or a chasm that must be leapt. The Athletics skill governs these actions. It serves as a measure of the character’s overall fitness and physical condition­ ing. Those who actively engage in a regimen of physi­ cal training such as survivalists or professional ath­ letes are most likely to have a high rank of Athletics. • Any aspects of climbing—including rappelling or swinging on a line—fall under the purview of the Athletics skill. The difficulty of these tasks is cal­ culated by the surface and weather conditions during the attempts. • Characters who attempt to swim in difficult con­ ditions must check their Athletics. Water condi­ tions—particularly waves, current, and tides—dic­ tate the overall challenge of any efforts to swim. • A character's vertical and horizontal jump are both determined through use of an Athletics check. Gravitational conditions and the distance required factor into the difficulty. • Any character can run, but sprinting or running for an extended time may fall under the purview of an Athletics check. The difficulty of an Athletics check is set by the sever­ ity of the task and the conditions. Attempting to perform a routine task under normal conditions should never re­ quire a check. A more challenging task—jumping more than a person’s body length or staying afloat for hours— should require ^ equal to the equivalent difficulty of the task. Adverse conditions—extreme rain, rough winds, or aggressive pursuit—could impose one or more ■ . A combination of these elements can make a check sig­ nificantly more difficult. Extremely adverse conditions— hurricane force winds or a surface covered in oil—and superhuman feats may introduce one or more # A dditional # on an Atnietics cnecK can eitner re­ duce the tim e required to make the check or increase the distance traveled w ith that check. O O on an Athletics check may be used to grant the character an additional maneuver during the course of his turn that can only be taken to move or perform some sort of physical activity. See page 200 for more information, and remember characters can only take a maximum of two maneuvers in their turn. Advantage can also generate bonus □ on other physical checks performed by allies that turn, or on physical checks the character performs later. Q) results on successful checks should allow the character to perform the check with truly impressive results—instead of heaving a boulder aside, he can hurl it bodily into the air, and instead of grabbing onto the edge of a hovering platform, the character could use his momentum to flip atop it, landing on his feet. As Athletics is usually used to perform physical ac­ tions, <§> and & results should most often result in physical penalties. Small amounts of <§> may cause the character to suffer strain, while larger amounts of <§> may cause the character to fall prone, or even suf­ fer a wound from sprains and bruises. ^ could even inflict a Critical Injury, chosen by the GM to be the­ matic or rolled randomly. CHARM (PRESENCE) For a character with a kind smile and a silver tongue, it may be possible to travel the galaxy depending upon the kindness of others. An individual with this knack is capable of giving just the right compliment to his target—often by deciphering the subject's secial and cultural background. Note that the use of the Charm skill requires the acting character to maintain a degree of sincerity in his statements. A character who is fla­ grantly flattering with no basis in reality may be bet­ ter suited to using the Deception skill. See Social Skill Interactions on page 113 for more information. Poli­ ticians, salesmen, and con artists are all renowned for their Charm. • Persuading an individual to make a special excep­ tion to his usual practices through flattery, flirting, and grace typically relies upon Charm. • Appeals to a target’s better nature—even if it does not exist—generally require a character to use Charm. These sorts of requests may often re­ quire the target to go out of his way to aid the characters, without any hope of remuneration. • Seduction attempts for most species typically rely upon Charm, but for situations where the in­ terest is entirely feigned it is often more appropri­ ate to use Deception. Charm is often an opposed check, using the sub­ ject’s Presence and Cool, except in situations where the PC is trying to Charm large groups, in which case it’s often a set difficulty. Of course, situational modi­ fiers may also apply based upon the character’s style of dress, species, and other characteristics. For in­ stances in which the desired outcome is directly op­ posed to the target’s interests, an additional Difficulty die may be added. For situations in which the character is attempting to sway multiple subjects or a target who is already pre­ disposed to react favorably toward the character, the character does not make an opposed check. Instead, the difficulty of the check is determined by the num­ ber of subjects and their disposition. Larger crowds or groups who are predisposed against the character’s desired outcome require a more difficult check, while Charming those already favorable towards the charac­ ter may require few, if any, Difficulty dice. Extra & on a Charm check may be used to extend the target’s support for additional scenes. Each Suc­ cess spent in this way gains the character an extra scene in which the target is willing to support him. O may be spent to affect unexpected subjects beyond the original target. These may be bystand­ ers or others not directly involved in the scene, but who may aid the character in their own way. With a <$, the player may choose to have a target NPC become a recurring character who remains predis­ posed to assist his character. This individual may not join the character’s crew, but might offer a better than usual price for fencing goods, or may let certain legal charges slide. <§> and ^ are, in a reverse fashion, harmful to a char­ acter’s standing with those he is trying to sway. Threat may be spent to reduce the number of people the character is able to influence or to turn those affected negatively against the character. The GM may use ^ to turn a single NPC against the character and to make him a minor recurring adversary. COERCION (WILLPOWER) Some people believe that the only way to be respected is to be feared. Others may only grant respect to those whom they fear. When a character attempts to instill obedience in a target through the use of threats or acts of physical intimidation, they utilize Coercion. See So­ cial Skill Interactions on page 11 3 for more informa­ tion. Sith, military dictators, and organized crime leaders are all known for their ability to coerce their subjects. • Any time a character issues a threat, whether or not it is accompanied by hostile actions, he is using Coercion against the subject. An implied threat—such as gesturing or pointing towards a weapon—is sufficient to invoke Coercion. • If a target is questioned or persuaded under conditions of physical captivity, the acting char­ acter should make a Coercion check. • Acts of physical torture always invoke Coercion. Of course, physical violence may also induce strain or wounds in a subject. Such actions are separate from the actual Coercion attempt. Coercion is an opposed check, resisted by the sub­ ject’s Willpower and Discipline. Situational modifiers, such as the degree to which a subject is helpless or if the acting character’s degree of threat is less significant than expected, may significantly affect the dice pool. Attempting to persuade a subject to betray his core beliefs should always add a Difficulty die to the pool. In situations in which the character is attempting to intimidate multiple subjects or a target who is already threatened by the character, the character need not make an opposed check. In such circumstances, the dif­ ficulty of the check is determined by the number of sub­ jects and their disposition. Larger crowds or groups who are more likely to resist forced authority require a more difficult check, while Coercing those already cowed by the character may require few, if any, Difficulty dice.

These may be bystanders or others not directly involved in the scene, but who may be cowed by the character as a result of witnessing the Coercion attempt. With <£, the character may completely break the subject’s willpow­ er. The target’s allegiance shifts to that of a subjugated ally of the acting character rather than an opponent. The newfound follower may be exploited to gain ad­ ditional information, assets, or even a spy within the ranks of a former foe. However, if the betrayal is discov­ ered, this forced loyalty may not be permanent. Intimidation and strong-arm tactics are only as suc­ cessful as the strength and thought behind the attempt. The CM may spend <§> and ^ to undermine the out- The difficulty for a Computers check is calculated based upon any defenses present within the system and the inherent sophistication of the system against intrusion. Slicing into a tapcafe’s systems to alter a transaction might be trivially easy, while a military outpost could be hardened and prepared for a slicer’s assault. In general, the more vital the materials pro­ tected by the system, the more difficult the system ' should be to overcome. come of a character’s Coercion attempt. Extra <§> may be spent by the GM to represent a building resentment to the Coercing character. Regardless of the success or failure of the Coercion attempt, the subject may grow to despise the character as a result of being strong-armed. on the other hand, may be spent to represent the character slipping up and revealing something about his goals and motivations to the target. For instance, a character attempting to coerce a target to give up security codes for a Hutt shipping lane may let slip information concerning the cargo he is at­ tempting to smuggle through Hutt space. COMPUTERS (INTELLECT) The galaxy could scarcely function with­ out the constant assistance of comput­ ers. Devices everywhere are linked to­ gether and coordinated by computers and droid brains. Those talented with computers can sometimes exploit these resources, or they might know how best to avoid those systems un­ der computer control. Many people are so unconsciously dependent upon computers that those who can cleverly manipulate them may com­ mit crimes without their victims even being aware of the offenses. Even us­ ing the HoloNet for communications or entertainment requires the use of computers—particularly if there are forces interfering with the system. This skill also governs the repair of a damaged com­ puter system, defensive actions against an intruding slicer, and routine maintenance necessary to keep the software on a computer or droid running effectively. • Attempts to open a locked door, control an eleva­ tor, or bypass a security system make use of the Computers skill. • Searching through a subject’s records, particu­ larly if those notes are encrypted, makes use of Computers to overcome any security measures and interpret the material’s organizational struc­ ture and any external links. • Investigating what actions a slicer might have tak­ en against a computer system requires the Com­ puters skill to identify the files that have been ac­ cessed or altered. • Efforts to alter a droid’s programming or gain ac­ cess to its memories require the acting character to make a Computers check. • Characters must make a Computers check to re­ cover data from a system that has suffered physi­ cal damage. Additional & may be spent to reduce the time required for the action under­ taken. This is generally representa­ tive of the character's extensive familiarity with sys­ tems of the type targeted. O may be spent to uncover additional information about the system. The character might discover ad­ ditional assets that could be targeted, the owner’s per­ sonal journal entries, or the presence of well-concealed defenses. Once the presence of such systems is discov­ ered, a character may attempt to gain access to them with further Computers checks. A ($) may be spent to ob­ fuscate any actions the character may have taken while slicing the system. Each may be spent to add # to the check if another slicer should attempt to detect or identify the character’s actions with a Computers check. The GM may spend <§) generated on a character’s Computers check to represent the character doing a poor job of concealing his presence in the system. Security systems are alerted to the presence of the character within the system, while other slicers at­ tempting to discover evidence of the character’s ac­ tions may add □ to their check for each <§> generated by the character’s initial Computers check. GAMBLING: COOL AND DECEPTION I n Edge of the Em pire, the Player Characters are likely to participate in gambling, whether as an idle pastime and chance to get a few credits, or as part of a major plot point. There are many forms of gambling, however, nearly all of the ones that involve playing against an opponent involve a cer­ tain element of bluff. Therefore, unless there are more detailed rules available for a specific type of gambling, it can be resolved with a competi­ tive Average (<> <)) Cool or Deception check between each of the characters engaged in the gambling (players choose Cool if they wish to play it straight, and Deception if they want to rely on bluffing and guile). Each character wagers a certain amount of money, and the winner of the check wins the entire pot. If there are no winners, the pot remains for another round. In this check, O and <§> can be spent to either gain an advantage for later rounds of gambling, or to represent good or bad wagers made dur­ ^ may be spent by a CM to represent the charac­ ter leaving behind trace information of his own system in the computer system he was attempting to slice. For each ^ generated by the character’s Computer check, the CM may add □ to any future Computer checks in which an NPC uses the target system to slice the charac­ ter's own computer system. COOL (PRESENCE) Life on the fringe is filled with an endless variety of dangers. The ability to stay calm and think as one’s life hangs in the balance can be essential for survival among the constant stream of new threats. By remaining emo­ tionally centered, the character is much more likely to be able to effectively prioritize issues and solve the most critical problems first. These characters are also better able to remember and focus upon achieving their goals, allowing outside influences to have much less effect. In some combat situations, a character’s Initiative may be determined by his Cool skill. This is applicable under circumstances in which the acting character has calmly prepared to take action. See page 199 for the full details. A character’s Cool may permit him to ignore many of the lies that come as part of a discussion. It is used to resist Charm and Negotiation. See Social Skill In­ teractions on page 11 3 for more information. • Often, when someone is trying to be overly kind, the truth becomes lost among the niceties. Char­ acters can use Cool to resist these efforts, pen­ etrating through to the truth. ing the round. Characters may spend O to de­ crease the amount of their own wager or increase the amount of an opponent’s wager by one half the original wager, representing their ability to cut their losses or bluff an opponent into betting more. They may also spend O O to gain ■ to their check during the next round ® can inflict strain as normal, or <§> <§> can cause a character to suffer a □ die during their next round of gambling. (£) can be spent in the same way as O to raise or lower wagers; however if it is spent in this manner it should increase or decrease the wager by twice the original amount, instead of half. Characters can also use Skulduggery on the check, if they want to try their hands at outright cheating. The check still works as normal, how­ ever, if the check generates any ^ results, they result in the character being caught cheating by the other players. This could result in unfortu­ nate consequences. • If a character has set a trap for a target, carefully lining up a shot on an unsuspecting foe, he may check for Initiative using Cool, as he calmly se­ lects the optimal time to begin the engagement. • If multiple characters are engaging a third in a social discussion in which the timing of the argu­ meant matters, Cool may be used to determine Initiative, as that character is better prepared. There is rarely an extra & on a Cool check, as it is gen­ erally used to oppose another’s actions, or to determine Initiative, which takes all & into account. An O from a Cool check may be spent to give the character an additional insight into the situation at hand. He may notice an additional complication before it comes into play against him or identify an object that can be directly used against his oppo­ nent. Examples could be a rogue asteroid during a dogfight, a security officer near a sniper’s target, or a magistrate’s predilection towards a particular style of argument. A character who generates a (£) result during a Cool check has not only stood unflinching as chaos erupts around him, but has actually come away better for it. For each result on a Cool check, the character may recover 3 strain. Sometimes a situation is so frantic that it can overwhelm even the most steadfast of souls. The GM may spend <§> generated as a result of a Cool check to cause the character to miss a vital detail or event. For instance, if a character generates a <§> during a duel, he may be so focused on his tar­ get that he fails to notice the target’s ally on the sidelines pulling a weapon of his own. If the situa­ tion goes badly enough, the character may lose all sense of where he is and what he is doing, effective­ ly succumbing to minor shell-shock. The CM may spend any ^ generated on a Cool check to Stun the character for one round as he is overwhelmed by the chaos around him. COORDINATION (AGILITY) When a character needs to go somewhere without be­ ing seen, it often requires him to balance upon unsta­ ble surfaces, crawl through narrow openings, or even to tumble down from a dangerous height. Overcom­ ing these types of challenges requires a tremendous sense of balance and a heightened degree of flexibil­ ity. While both of those abilities depend heavily upon a person’s natural characteristics, they can be further developed through regimens of practice and exercise. Any time a character needs to contort his body into an unusual position, Coordination is used to calculate the dice pool. Note that some species may be inher­ ently more flexible than the norm. This benefit is dis­ cussed in their species description where applicable. Many performers, mercenaries, and thieves be­ come known for their natural flexibility and grace. For some, their lives may frequently depend upon their expertise in the skill. For others, the skill serves as an important complement to their other techniques. • A character may attempt to reducing damage suf­ fered when falling, diminishing the impact by rolling into a tumble on a successful Coordination action. See Falling on page 21 5 for more information. • Walking across a narrow surface, whether a wide beam or a thin pipe, requires a tremendous sense of balance and a successful Coordination check. • Characters can use Coordination to escape from restraints, contorting their limbs at unusual an­ gles so that bindings slip free. • Crawling through the twists and turns of a sewage pipe, ventilation duct, or garbage chute may re­ quire a successful Coordination check to avoid a sudden fall, or worse yet—becoming stuck in place. Any additional & received when using Coordination may be spent to increase the distance travelled dur­ ing the action checked, or decrease the time it takes to perform the action. Each Success spent in this way can increase the distance moved by 25%, up to a maximum of & # & & O O on a Coordination check may be used to grant the character an additional maneuver during the course of his turn. (Flowever, during an encoun­ ter a character can only use two maneuvers per turn). ^ on a Coordination check may be spent to accom­ plish the task with truly impressive results, either with narrative flair, or granting additional benefits in the course of completing it. For example, instead of walk­ ing across a rope to get across a chasm, the character could cut the rope, swing across, and in doing so deny anyone the ability to follow him. To represent a character doing harm to his body in the process of a Coordination check, the CM could spend <§> generated during that check to cause the character to lose his free maneuver for one round per Threat. ^ represents something truly harmful happening to the character during his check. A character could suffer a wound as a result of ^ during a Coordination check, or could lose a vital piece of equipment. DECEPTION (CUNNING) Sometimes a character needs to persuade someone to act a certain way, but lacks any leverage for the discus­ sion. In times like this, a certain degree of moral flexibil­ ity may be necessary. Whether it is an effort to persuade someone to make a purchase, do a favor, or simply be somewhere else, a well-timed and convincing lie can of­ ten be the difference between success and failure. When a falsehood plays the central part of a persuasive effort, that character is employing the Deception skill. Con art­ ists, infiltrators, and many less reputable diplomats and merchants are all masters of Deception. Many individu­ also outside of these fields make use of this skill, but it is seldom a critical focus of their development. Attem pts to deceive are subject to the percep­ tions of the target. Deception is opposed by the subject's Discipline. See Social Skill Interactions on page 11 3 for more information. In situations in which the character is attem pting to trick multiple subjects or a target who believes that character to be trustworthy, the character need not make an op­ posed check. In such circumstances, the difficulty of the check is determ ined by the number of sub­ jects or their disposition (or both). Larger crowds or groups who are more likely to disbelieve the char­ acter require a more difficult check, while deceiving those already fooled by the character may require a lower difficulty. • If a character wishes to mislead a buyer or seller about an object’s value so that he may adjust the purchase price to his advantage, he uses Deception. • Any time a character wishes to distract an opponent through guile—even within the context of a physical confrontation—he may make use of Deception. • When pursued, a character may choose to use De­ ception as a means to lay a false trail, in the hopes that the tracker might make a wrong turn, thus leaving the acting character ample time to escape. Extra & on a Deception attempt may be spent to extend the duration of the Deception action. This could give the acting character ample time to travel >1 off world before the treachery is noticed or might even leave the target less likely to notice the fraud and more susceptible to further deceptions. O may be used to increase the value of any goods or services gained through the action. The subject might simply believe that he is agreeing to fair terms with the liar. 0 may be spent to fool the target into believing that the character is a trustworthy sort. Future Deception checks against the target do not require an opposed check, they are simply made at a baseline difficulty de­ pending on the nature of the lie. '§> during a Deception check gives away a portion of the lie. Perhaps the target realizes that it has been lied to, but is unable to identify how much of the interac­ tion is false, thereby becoming more suspicious of the character. ^ may represent a more extreme example of this phenomenon; the target not only distrusts the character, but spreads the word of his deceit and harms his reputation amongst a small community of people. Additionally, the target may realize that ne is Deing nea to ana use the situation to ms aavan- tage, perhaps to insert some false information of his own. Perhaps the target is able to slip shoddy gear past the character by playing along with the lie. DISCIPLINE (WILLPOWER) There are boundless horrors present across the span of the galaxy. Some—like the rancor, the wampa, and the krayt dragon—are natural entities, which are hor­ rifically violent as an outgrowth of their environs. Oth­ ers, such as Sithspawn horrors or the Death Star, are deliberate creations made by sentient life, which serve little purpose save to spread terror and destruction. Through the course of their adventures, characters may often encounter creatures that seek to dismember or devour them. The ability to maintain their composure and react in an effective manner is governed by their Discipline. This skill represents a character’s ability to overcome his biological instincts, so that he can overcome things that might induce utter panic in a person of lesser resolve. A character's Discipline may enable him to overcome treachery and threats that others attem pt to impose upon him. It is used to resist Leadership, Coercion, and Deception. Se§ Social Skill Interactions on page 11 3 for more information. Discipline plays a key role in the develop­ meant of Force abilities. See Chapter VIII: The Force for the full explanation. • If a character is pinned down by [heavy fire, he may need to pass a Discipline 1 check in order to act normally. • When confronted by a creature with inher­ ently horrifying aspects, a character’s ability to engage the foe rather than flee before its might is governed by the Discipline skill. • Sometimes, a business contact might offer a character a deal that seems far too good to :be true. The ability to resist such temptations is based upon Discipline. • Mentally sorting truth from fiction and de­ termining when someone is lying (and not letting oneself be swayed by those lies), is often a func- ' tion of Discipline. Discipline is often used to oppose another’s ac­ tions—where there is no roll—so it may not always be possible to generate an extra In situations where an extra & can be earned, one may be spent to downgrade # to a + on the character’s next action. O from a Discipline check may be spent to give the character an additional insight into the situation at hand. He might notice a particular vulnerability on a seemingly indomitable foe or an unusual pattern to the suppressing fire that gives the character a mo­ meant to leap from cover. Often, the sight of an ally looking danger in the eyes and refusing to blink is all it takes to bolster one’s resolve. ($ generated during a Discipline check may be spent to add □ to any Disci­ pline checks made by the character’s allies during the following round. The GM may spend ® generated during a Disci­ pline check to undermine the character’s resolve, per­ haps inflicting a penalty on further actions in the face of distressing circumstances. ^ may be spent to over­ whelm the character entirely. In this case, the charac­ ter is unable to perform more than a single maneuver during the following round of combat. LEADERSHIP (PRESENCE) Even the greatest of heroes may sometimes need the assistance of others to complete their goals. Certainly the most foul of villains consistently use legions of flunkies to assist them in their criminal rampages. The ability to lead such companions and devotees can play a crucial part in the success or failure of any endeavor. While some may follow out of fear or the promise of tremendous riches, ultim ately most individuals choose to work with a person in whom they have faith and trust. The Lead­ ership skill represents a character’s a bility to instill that belief in the people with whom he chooses to interact. Politicians, m ilitary officers, and crime bosses all determine their degree of success based upon their abilities to lead others. Leadership is a combination of being able to make smart decisions, being firm and decisive when do­ ing so, and instilling a sense of loyalty and respect in one’s subordinates. See Social Skill Interactions on page 11 3 for more information. • If a character’s allies have become subject to the effects of fear (see page 298), they may be ral­ lied through a Leadership check. • When acting in a public venue, a character may use Leadership to sway a crowd to take action, most commonly of a political nature. • If a character’s underlings have fallen before the guile of an opponent, he may reassert their loy­ alty to his cause by making a successful Leader­ ship check. The difficulty of a Leadership check is based on the complexity of the orders a character is attempting to convey and the intelligence and professionalism of the subjects he is attempting to command. Particu­ larly complex orders, or stubborn or particularly dull subjects, require a larger number of Difficulty dice, while a simple order given to a loyal servant may re­ quire few, if any, Difficulty dice. When a character attempts to command a target to perform an action that could result in his harm or is in some other way against his nature or best interest, an opposed check is required. The character’s Leadership check is opposed by the Discipline or Willpower of the target, depending on the particulars of the order given. Extra & on a Leadership check may be used to ex­ tend the target’s support for additional scenes or may increase the efficiency or effectiveness of the target during the ordered actions. O may be used to affect bystanders in addition to the target. With (£>, the player may choose to have the target NPC become a recurring character who decides to faithfully follow the acting character. This individual may decide to join the character’s crew, offering his ser­ vices as a permanent aide de camp. The GM may spend <§) generated during a Leader­ ship check to decrease the efficiency of the ordered actions, causing them to take longer or be done poorly. ^ may be used to undermine the charac­ te r’s authority, damaging the character’s ability to command the target or those who witnessed the attem pt. Should a character accrue m ultiple ^ on a single leadership check, the target may become a recurring thorn in the character’s side, either by refusing future orders outright or turning others against the character. MECHANICS (INTELLECT) Space travel is fraught with dangers. A failed life sup­ port system can leave a crew desperate to find any haven where they might safely land. A failed hyper­ space engine might strand them hopelessly far from the nearest repair yard. Individuals who accept these dangers need to either have tremendous faith in the quality of their craft or the mechanical skills of its crew. Even in those cases where confidence is based upon a craft’s quality and maintenance regimen, the presence of a capable mechanic can still be crucial to the ship’s ultimate survival. Planetary and atmospheric craft, droids, and even a trusty blaster can break down at the least convenient possible moment. These different devices use vastly different technologies, but there are core concepts that any technical expert can carry over from one device to another. The Mechanics skill represents the expertise required for any of these repairs. The skill plays a criti­ cal role for any technician, but is also relevant for pilots, survivalists, and anyone else who travels the fringe. • Any device that suffers physical damage may be repaired using the Mechanics skill with proper tools. • A character may use Mechanics prior to beginning a repair job, so that he can identify the parts and tools necessary for the job along with their approx­ imate cost. This information may be particularly useful to a character seeking to pay for repairs. • Sometimes, a character may have access to an extensive supply of discrete components or dam­ aged devices. In this situation, attempts to con­ struct a completely new device are dependent upon the Mechanics skill. At the Game Master’s discretion, it may be im ­ possible to complete a repair w ithout the necessary tools or components. Alternatively, the Game Mas­ ter may choose to apply additional ^ to represent temporary fixes. Additional & on a Mechanics check may be used to increase the efficiency of the action. Each additional # may be used to reduce the time required to make the check by 10-20%. O generated during a Mechanics check can mean especially high-quality repairs, possibly even mak­ ing the item even higher quality than it originally was. This may grant □ when using the item, or even make it count as having the Superior quality for a session. ($) earned on a Mechanics check may give a device an additional function, which is only good for a single use. Examples might include a temporary engine speed boost or a more powerful blaster shot. The nature and precise details of this temporary function are subject to the Game Master’s discretion. Mechanics checks may have specific rules when applied to repairing starships and vehicles, see page 243. <§> during a Mechanics check may represent particu­ larly shoddy repairs or temporary measures. The GM may spend <§> to cause the target object or system to malfunction shortly after the Mechanics check is com­ pleted. ^ may be spent to cause further harm to the target object or system, or to cause other components of the target to begin to malfunction. MEDICINE (INTELLECT) Through the course of their travels, characters are cer­ tain to suffer injuries. Minor injuries may not require medical intervention, but more serious ones may need the attentions of a trained professional. The Medicine skill is that training, and can be used to heal cuts and bruises as well as life-threatening injuries. • Routine first aid, including medpacs, depend upon a character’s abilities in Medicine. Medpacs are mercifully simple to use, but the difficulty may be complicated by the severity of the wound. • The ability to treat a poison—or to inflict o n e - falls under the Medicine skill. This also governs the use of pharmaceutical and recreational drugs. • Many planets harbor unique infectious diseases as well as parasites. A well-traveled medical technician may become familiar with both the symptoms and treatments for many such planetary syndromes. • More serious treatments—including surgeries, cy­ bernetic augmentations, and psychotherapy—are governed by Medicine, but generally require ad­ ditional pharmaceuticals and medical instruments. The difficulty of the check is based on the target's current state of health. See Table 3 -2 : Medical Check Difficulty. On a successful check, the target recovers a number of wounds equal to the number of successes generated by the Medicine roll, and an amount of strain equal to the number of advantages generated. TABLE 3-2: MEDICAL CHECK DIFFICULTY State of Health Medicine Check Current wounds equal half or less of wound threshold Easy (♦ ) Current wounds equal more than half of wound threshold Average f ) Current wounds exceed wound threshold Hard ( + + + ) Recover Critical Injury Critical Injury Severity Rating Note that a character may attempt only one Medicine check per week when helping a character to recover from critical wounds. Note also that droids may not benefit from Medicine, but they may substitute the Mechanics skill for these same healing checks. Charac­ ters attempting to treat their own injuries increase the difficulty of the Medicine check by ♦ ♦ Each # on a Medicine check normally heals a sin­ gle wound, up to the maximum number of wounds the target is currently suffering. Beyond that, additional # have no mechanical effect but may represent par­ ticularly competent medical aid. O generated during a Medicine check may be spent to eliminate one strain from the target. gen­ erated during a Medicine check to heal a Critical In­ jury may also heal additional wounds, or vice versa. A GM may use <§> during a Medicine check to in­ flict strain on the target to represent the shock of the procedure or to increase the amount of time the procedure takes. ^ represents a truly terrible acci­ dent, perhaps the character unintentionally inflicting further wounds on a target whom he was attempting to heal of a Critical Injury. NEGOTIATION (PRESENCE) Often, the easiest way to get someone’s cooperation is by giving them exactly what they want. The art of Negotiation deals with determining exactly how much of what a subject wants must be surrendered in order to get a particular good or service in return. A master negotiator might need to make only the most mini­ mal of sacrifices in exchange for a vital service, while a novice could be forced to dramatically overpay— particularly if he lets his desperation show. This skill is essential for anyone who regularly deals in traded goods, but is also vitally important to anyone whose livelihood depends upon selling their services. Characters need to effectively negotiate if they ever hope to pay down their Obligations. Negotiation is op­ posed by the subject’s Presence and Cool. See Social Skill Interactions on this page for more information. • Any time a character wishes to purchase goods or services, he must either pay the seller’s asking price or utilize the Negotiation skill. SOCIAL SKILL INTERACTIONS N ot every conflict must be resolved by force of arms. In fact, it can often be in a character’s best interest to resolve a situation amicably. Whenever one character attempts to convince another character to act in a specific way, this is an Influence check. These checks are com­ monly used to determine how the target reacts to the attempt. They are often opposed checks, although not when dealing with groups. If the act­ ing character is successful, the target is turned to his point of view—at least for the duration of the scene. On failure, the arguments presented fail to sway the opposing character. If the characters have a previous relationship, this may add H or □ to the check. If the target has prior evidence that the acting character is trustworthy, then he is much more likely to cooperate. However, if there are prior acts of betrayal, the situation may become far more challenging. Ultimately, the different skills are indicative of the way that a character is attempting to manipu­ late his target. Charm governs trying to persuade a target by being nice to him. Coercion represents efforts to scare an opponent into submission. Deception entails lying to the target so that he might cooperate. Leadership reflects the use of authority—real or imagined. Negotiation reflects persuading someone to cooperate by offering him something that he wants. Table 3 -3 : Social Skill Interactions illustrates the skill oppositions. Refer to the individual skill descriptions for additional details on the various social skills involved. TABLE 3-3: SOCIAL SKILL INTERACTIONS Acting Skill Opposing Skill Coercion, Deception, Leadership Discipline Charm Cool Negotiation N egotiation o r Cool • If a character wishes to sell goods or services, the final price is determined by a Negotiation check. • When two individuals create an agreement or treaty, they may make an opposed or competi­ tive Negotiation check. The winner gains the bet­ ter end of the resulting agreement. Negotiation is usually an opposed check, using the target’s Cool or Negotiation. Situational modifiers may also apply based upon any past relationship between the characters involved and the overall desirability of the goods and services in question. The cases where this skill may be used without an opposed check are exceedingly rare, but the opportunity may present itself. In such a case, the CM is encouraged to gauge the difficulty of the check by the factors mentioned above. Extra # on a Negotiation check may be used to increase the acting character’s profit by 5% per # They may alternatively be used to modify the scope of the agreement, so that the contract can extend for a longer period of time or more goods may be ob­ tained for a given price. O generated during a Negotiation check may be spent to earn unrelated boons from the target, either concessions if the check is failed, or extra perks if it is passed. With a (J), the player may choose to have the target NPC become a regular client or specialist vendor. The NPC might thereafter keep an eye out for specific goods the PC may be interested in, or offer referrals to other clients in regards to the quality of his service. ® during a Negotiation check may be spent to increase the cost of goods the character is attem pt­ ing to purchase, to decrease the value of those he is trying to sell, or to shorten contracts he is trying to negotiate. A CM may spend ^ to seriously sabotage the character’s goals during the interaction; perhaps the character receives counterfeit goods or payment, or agrees to terms that are entirely beyond the scope of the negotiation. PERCEPTION (CUNNING) Characters must often maintain a careful awareness of their environment. Subtle cues can hint at immi­ nent danger or unexpected advantage. The Percep­ tion skill represents the character’s constant, passive state of awareness. This is how a character notices concealed or subtle cues when he is not actively seeking them out. The skill is critical for anyone who faces dangers on a regular basis—whether they are in the wilds of a frontier world or among the urban jungle of a sprawling city. Note that Perception encompasses all of a character’s natural senses. Humans without cybernetic augmenta­ tion are limited to five. However, many alien races have additional means to perceive their surroundings. • If a character is unprepared for a trap or an ambush, he may have an opportunity to make a Perception check to avoid being surprised. Alternatively, this might oppose an attacker's Stealth check. • Opposed Skulduggery checks are often opposed by a target’s Perception. • Perception may be checked any time the charac­ ter has an opportunity to notice a subtle clue—an overheard conversation, the stink of a Jawa, or a drug introduced to their beverage. • Perception can be used in surveillance situations, where the user is trying to observe an unaware target from a distance. Perception may be opposed by skills used for con­ cealment or might have a difficulty set by the envi­ ronment. The noise of a loud factory could conceal a conversation just as a spicy drink might prevent a character from noticing a poison. Extra ^ on a Perception check may be spent to reveal additional details. Perhaps the character rec­ ognized the speaker’s accent, the pigments involved in a counterfeit artwork, or the number of attackers lying in ambush. An O may be spent to recall additional information associated with the object noticed. Perhaps a passing familiarity with a field of study represents the reason why the character initially realized that something was out of place. A (£ may be spent to notice details that can be useful later, so characters can gain □ on future interactions with the noticed element. <§> resulting from a Perception check may be spent by the GM to conceal a vital detail about the situation or environment from the character. A ^ may be spent to cause the character to obtain false information about his surroundings or the target in question. PILOTING (PLANETARY) (AGILITY) When characters travel across the surface of one of the galaxy’s numerous worlds, they often stray far from their spacecraft. Smaller craft, particularly ones best suited to a given planet’s habitats, are commonly used for sur­ face transportation. This can include repulsorlift vehi­ cles, watercraft, and aircraft. No matter how the vehicle moves—rolling, gliding, walking, flying, or floating—the skill that governs its use is Piloting (Planetary). Under normal traffic and environmental condi­ tions, a character should never need to actually check the Piloting (Planetary) skill. Its use is reserved for the most extreme of conditions. This might include a high-speed pursuit, travel in treacherous weather conditions, the use of a failing vehicle, or any com­ bination of these complications. For some, this skill is a passion and a livelihood; for others it is simply a necessity of their lifestyle. • If a character is confronted by a completely foreign type of atmospheric craft, they must make a Pilot­ ing (Planetary) check to decipher its basic controls. • Any time two characters are involved in a race upon a world’s surface, the results are determined by an opposed check using Piloting (Planetary). • If a character is either chasing another or being chased, losing the follower or maintaining the tail is done through an opposed Piloting (Plan­ etary) check. The difficulty of a Piloting (Planetary) check may be determined based upon the difficulty of any particu­ lar maneuver, the prevailing weather conditions, and any features or failures on the vehicle involved. Extra ^ on a Piloting (Planetary) check allow the acting character to gain insights into the situation. Al­ ternatively, he might deduce a way that his vehicle could be modified so that it could be more effective in the future. O generated during a Piloting (Planetary) check may be spent to reveal a vulnerability in an opponent’s piloting style or vehicle, giving the charac­ ter a benefit in later rounds of combat. (J on a Pilot­ ing (Planetary) check may be used to let the character take an additional maneuver action while continuing to pilot a vehicle. A GM may spend <§> <§) during a Piloting (Planetary) check to give opponents □ on checks against the character and his vehicle to represent a momentary malfunction in one of the vehicle’s systems. ^ may be spent to deal actual damage to the vehicle, as the character strains systems throughout the vehicle dur­ ing his check. PILOTING (SPACE) (AGILITY) Those who travel between worlds find their ability to pi­ lot a starship paramount. Some use these craft as weap­ owns of war, working as mercenaries in any of the galaxy's countless conflicts. Others use their vessels to transport desirable goods—either legally or illegally—so that they might be delivered to anxious consumers. Whether a crew is attempting to avoid enemy fire or simply un­ wanted attention, their success or failure is most often dependent upon the person manning the helm. Routine actions—like taking off or landing without additional complications—do not require a Piloting (Space) check. When those actions are complicated by a blinding sandstorm, a failed motivator, or enemy fire, then skill checks come into play. • Whenever two or more spaceships race, a compet­ itive Piloting (Space) check determines the results. • Chases, whether they are through asteroid belts, within a crowded battlefield, or skirting the edge of a gravimetric instability, are resolved with an opposed Piloting (Space) check. • During a space conflict, pilots may often jockey for position to determine which shields face the enemy and which weapons may be brought to bear. When opponents attempt to negate these efforts, the winner is identified through an op­ posed Piloting (Space) check. The difficulty of a Piloting (Space) check may be de­ terminated based upon the difficulty of any particular maneuver, any unusual navigational hazards, and any features or failures on the spacecraft involved. Extra & on a Piloting (Space) check allow the acting character to gain insights into the situation. Alterna­ tively, he might deduce a way that his vehicle could be modified so that it could be more effective in the future. O generated during a Piloting (Space) check may be spent to reveal a vulnerability in an opponent’s piloting style or vehicle, giving the character a benefit in later rounds of combat. A <$ on a Piloting (Space) check may be used to let the character take an additional maneuver action while continuing to pilot a vehicle. A GM may spend two <§> during a Piloting (Space) check to give opponents □ on checks against the char­ acter and his vehicle to represent a momentary malfunc­ tion in one of the vehicle’s systems. ^ may be spent to deal actual damage to the vehicle, as the character strains systems throughout the vehicle during his check. RESILIENCE (BRAWN) The galaxy doesn’t stop moving just because a char­ acter needs a break. To achieve their objectives, char­ acters must often have the perseverance to overcome the most challenging obstacles. These can include sleep deprivation, hideous climates, and malnutrition. They might also ingest toxins, either inadvertently when scavenging for food or due to the malicious ac­ tions of a competitor. Resilience represents a character’s physical forti­ tude against all threats of this sort. This skill reflects the body’s ability to be pushed beyond reasonable limits. When characters make a Resilience check, their actions are typically taking them into situations that most would consider bad ideas. • When a character attempts to go without sleep for significantly longer than is healthy for his species, he must make a Resilience check to remain awake. • If a character ingests a toxin, he uses Resilience to resist its effects. • When a character endures prolonged exposure to a hostile environment—including heat, cold, or toxic pollution—the consequences may be miti­ gated with a successful Resilience check. • Dehydration and malnutrition can quickly leave a character badly fatigued, and Resistance pro­ tects against this. The difficulty for a Resilience check is based upon the severity of the effects that the character attempts to overcome. Going 24 hours without sleep could add only a single but traveling through the Tatooine desert with inadequate water at midday should be far more difficult. Extra & on a Resilience check may be used to ex­ tend the effects of the Success, so that the character may go for a longer period of time prior to making an additional check. An O earned on a Resilience check may be used to identify a way for the character and his allies to reduce the difficulty of future checks against the same threat, while a (£) may be spent to recover three strain as the character resolves to work through the adversity. The GM may spend <§> generated during a Resilience check to overburden the character, inflicting penalties on subsequent checks. ^ may be spent to inflict a wound or a minor Critical Injury on the character as he succumbs to the harsh conditions. Skulduggery encompasses a broad range of skills that are crucial to performing criminal actions. These include the physical abilities to perform a crime as well as the mental familiarity with different techniques. This includes picking pockets and locks, breaking into and out of se­ cure facilities, sleight of hand, disguise, setting traps, and other mischievous actions. At the Game Master’s discre­ tion, a particular Skulduggery check may use Agility in­ stead of Cunning, to reflect a more physical approach. SKULDUGGERY (CUNNING) • If a character attempts to pick a lock or pocket, he often uses Skulduggery. Some electronic locks could require Computers or Skulduggery, or both. • Once an imprisoned character slipped his bonds using Coordination, escaping from a cell depends upon Skulduggery for picking locks and avoiding security. • Identifying the most vulnerable aspects of a secu­ rity scheme can be nearly intuitive for a character that has become practiced in Skulduggery. Skulduggery is often opposed by a target's Percep­ tion. In instances where another character is not di­ rectly involved, the quality of the object being over­ come should determine the degree of difficulty. One or more # on a Skulduggery check should indicate additional insights that the acting character gained about the nature of his opposition. This might suggest that the thief could better plan his strategy against the current foe to avoid future complications. A character may spend O earned on a Skuldug­ gery check to identify an additional potential target, or gain additional items. Perhaps as the characters make good their escape, they discover their oppo­ nent's cache of antique weapons. A (£ may be spent to earn the character a boon he had not expected. In such cases, the value of the item stolen might exceed his expectations, and might also provide vital infor­ mation. When using Skulduggery to pick a lock, the character might devise a near permanent means of overcoming the' lock, perhaps by crafting a makeshift key or by getting access to the actual key itself. By generating <§> during a Skulduggery check, a char­ acter gives the GM the opportunity to catch him imme­ diately after the act. Depending on the amount of Threat spent by the GM, the character will be in varying degrees of danger; the more Threat, the more immediate the dis­ covery and ensuing danger. The GM may spend ^ to cause the character to leave behind some evidence of his larceny. Perhaps a recognizable piece of adornment, such as the character's heirloom ring, slips off into the target's pocket as the character attempts to pick it. STEALTH (AGILITY) w Often, a character may have business to conduct mat is best completed with a certain degree of privacy It might be that there are powerful individuals—either legal or criminal authorities—who are directly op­ posed to his choice of actions. Other times, a char­ acter might either be collecting or avoiding a bounty. Under such conditions, a successful endeavor may depend entirely upon how talented the character is at not being noticed. The Stealth skill reflects this ability under virtually all situations. Any criminal that depends upon physical inser­ tion must be a master of this trade. Similarly, anyone whose skills include espionage needs to be able to avoid notice. Stealth also encompasses wilderness camouflage skills, which may be crucial to any hunter. • Attempts to hide from all of an opponent’s senses are dependent upon Stealth, though difficulties may be modified by ambient conditions and any applicable gear. • Stealth can allow characters to shadow or follow individuals without being detected. • Characters may attempt to hide people or ob­ jects from the attentions of others, either through concealment or misdirection. Such actions are dependent upon their Stealth skill. The difficulty of a Stealth check often depends on the abilities of those the character is attempting to avoid. Members of species that are more dependent upon smell, hearing, or other senses may be most susceptible to Stealth under different weather con­ ditions or distracted by events that seem trivial to a species focused on visual cues. Stealth checks are typically opposed by Perception, based upon whether the opponent is passively or ac­ tively searching for the hidden character. Extra & on a Stealth check may be used to aid any allied characters that are infiltrating at the same time. Effectively, the successful character points out a factor that might otherwise have caused the ally to fail. O may be spent to decrease the amount of time required to perform a given task while using the Stealth skill. This could represent the character finding supe­ rior cover, giving him the ability to move faster while remaining out of sight, or successfully distracting a key figure to give him access to his target. Under the right circumstances, a character may spend a (& to identify a way to completely distract an opponent for the dura­ tion of the scene. This could allow the character to drop all pretense of Stealth in favor of completing a task far more swiftly. The GM may spend <§> generated during a Stealth check to hinder the character as he attempts to re­ main hidden. The character may need to overcome a particularly unpleasant obstacle or take extra time to remain out of sight. The GM may increase the time it takes for the character to perform his desired action while hidden by 25% per <§> spent in this way. The GM may spend ^ to cause the character to leave behind some evidence of his passing. While this has no bear­ ing on the success or failure of his Stealth check, some object, clue, or information is left behind concerning the character's identity and possibly even his motive. STREETWISE (CUNNING) Life on the galaxy’s fringe—and in the less savory por­ tions of the Core Worlds—is filled with treachery. A stranger can seldom be trusted, and a friend might turn traitor for the right compensation. Those who manage to survive in such an environment soon learn to recognize the warning signs that come with danger as well as those that might signal an opportunity. Knowing where to go for help when times are hard can be just as important as knowing how to avoid an unwinnable confrontation. The Streetwise skill represents the instinctive under­ standing that comes from a lifetime of such experienc­ es. While a few manage to learn the signs and develop a gut instinct through careful study and association with those who have lived this hard life, most come about this information through the school of hard knocks. If a character expects to thrive within the complex network of the criminal underworld, he must learn to speak its language and recognize the roles of those involved. • If a character is looking for a merchant who special­ izes in unsavory goods or illicit services, such a mer­ chant may be located through a Streetwise check. • Streetwise represents a character’s instinct for how to pick up on subtle cues from the language and attitudes of those who operate outside of legal structures. It may be used to understand subtle references within conversations. • When dealing with criminals or underworld ele­ ments, knowing how to approach them and open a conversation without coming across as a threat uses Streetwise. Generally, Knowledge (Underworld) governs specific information and facts involving criminals and under­ world elements. Streetwise governs how to use that in­ formation effectively, and how to operate in any crimi­ nal environment. Extra ^ on a Streetwise check may be used to reduce the time or funds required to obtain the item, service, or information sought. O may reveal additional rumors or alternative sources that can be used to find something. ($) may be spent to earn the character a semi-permanent con­ tact on the street, someone to whom the character may turn for information regularly with a reasonable assurance of trust. The GM may spend ® generated during a Street­ wise check to seed the gathered information with minor falsehoods, representing the ever-changing nature of in­ formation passed by word of mouth on the street. ^ may be spent to represent a character letting slip details about himself or the information he seeks, information that may be picked up by an adversary. SURVIVAL (CUNNING) It is not uncommon for characters to become isolated far from civilized worlds. Sometimes this is by choice, other times, they could be stranded on a world, hop­ ing for some sort of rescue. Learning to recognize the dangers of the natural environment as well as exploit­ ing its resources is dependent upon the Survival skill. Characters who spent their formative years on wil­ derness planets often have this skill as part of their background. Others may learn it as part of military training. Some may be completely dependent upon it as their job focuses on traveling to untamed worlds so that they may exploit their natural resources. • When a character needs to identify safe food, po­ table water, or shelter in a natural environment, each of these tasks requires a Survival check. • Characters who are skilled at Survival understand weather patterns; recognizing the signs of imminent dangerous conditions, and knowing how to prepare. • Tracking a subject through the wilderness—wheth­ er game or a bounty—is dependent upon Survival. • Survival governs a character’s ability to handle domesticated animals, so that they may be used as beasts of burden or as transport. The difficulty for a Survival check is dependent upon the severity of the environment. Key factors are the biocompatibility of a world's native life with the PC, weather conditions, and the basic tools on hand. # that exceed the difficulty on a Survival check may be used to assist other characters in surviving. Alterna­ tively, the character may choose to stockpile goods so that he may go a longer period of time between checks. O may be spent to gain an insight into the environ­ meant that makes future Survival checks easier. This might be a watering hole where prey is common, an abandoned cave that makes an excellent shelter, or a grove of biocompatible fruit trees. When tracking, an O may be spent to learn a detail about the target, its numbers, its species, or how recently tracks were made. ($) generated during a Survival check to handle animals may be spent to permanently predispose the target animal towards the character in a positive way, effectively earning the character a loyal companion. While tracking, (& may be spent to learn a vital clue about the target, whether his destination, his disposi­ tion, or the presence of prisoners or cargo. The CM may spend <§> generated on a Survival check to represent the character spending vital resources during the course of his check, perhaps using food as bait to catch game, or losing fuel in an attempt to make a fire. ^ may be spent to inflict wounds, Critical Injuries, or high levels of strain on the character as he succumbs to the untamed environments of the galaxy. VIGILANCE (WILLPOWER) In uncertain times, individuals who are constantly prepared to face a variety of challenges are far more likely to succeed than those who simply re­ act to the ever-changing circumstance. This sort of preparedness requires mental discipline, and can require instantaneous decisions when disaster or unexpected events suddenly strike. Characters who must remain alert because of the nature of their lifestyles are often particularly vigilant. This includes those who live within hostile environ­ ments—either urban jungles or dangerous wilder­ ness—as well as professional soldiers. This skill is of­ ten associated with a high degree of self-assuredness. • In combat situations, outside of those times when a character has patiently prepared to begin the en­ gagement, Vigilance is used to calculate Initiative. • Vigilance represents how fastidious a character is about preparing for unexpected crises. Any time there is a question regarding whether a small piece of gear might be available, a Vigilance check can be made to confirm its presence. The difficulty for a Vigilance check is typically modi­ fied by the likelihood of the incident that occurs. A char­ acter might be prepared for an ambush when traveling a darkened alley, but is unlikely to expect a groundquake in the middle of the night. A poor result on such a check might leave the character momentarily unable to act as he mentally attempts to decipher the current situation. When calculating Initiative, all # are generally used as part of the calculation. In other situations where this check is critical, extra # may indicate that the character was particularly well-prepared for this sort of conflict. Some im portant supply might be readily accessible. Characters may spend O on a Vigilance check to no­ tice an environmental factor that could play a key part in the relevant scene. This might be excellent cover, a convenient escape route, or something that could be used to distract a foe. 0 may be spent to allow the character to take an extra maneuver during the first round of a combat, as his keen awareness alerts him to a situation before it even arises. See page 200 for more information, and remember characters can only take a maximum of two maneuvers in their turn. The CM may spend <§> generated during a Vigi­ lance check to cause the character to miss a key piece of information about the situation or the envi­ ronment, blinding him to a possible advantage. The GM may spend ^ to make the character unable to perform more than a single maneuver during the first round of combat. COMBAT SKILLS S kills that are tightly focused on use during physical confrontations are considered Combat skills. Appli­ cation of these abilities is almost always violent, but need not be deadly. Full details on using Combat skills during conflicts are described in Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat. Chapter 6 also contains information concerning how a character may make use of extra & . as well as O and ($i generated during a Combat skill check, as well as how the CM may spend <§> and ^ symbols in such circumstances. BRAWL (BRAWN) During some physical confrontations, a character seeks to incapacitate his foe without seriously injuring him. At other times, a melee erupts with little prep­ aration, and a character may not have any weapon at hand. Some individuals are thoroughly trained in unarmed combat, or have natural weapons that they prefer to use during physical altercations. In any of these situations, Brawl is the skill used to determine success or failure in the combat. Most characters who grew up in a hostile environ­ meant have some knack for Brawl. All wildlife—partic­ ularly those with natural weapons—use Brawl when forced into a confrontation. Anyone who participates in military or law enforcement training learns some basic martial arts, which fall under the Brawl skill. Even more advanced or esoteric martial arts fall under the auspice of this skill. However, im­ provised weapons—such as a bottle or a table leg—are used with the Melee skill. In some conflicts, characters may be bound by the legal or social restrictions into fighting without weapons. Drawing a weapon could quickly escalate matters to a lethal fight and might have other reper­ cussions, forcing the characters to depend upon their Brawl skill. Brawl is used in unarmed combat, see page 211 for more details about this. The difficulty of Brawl checks is Average ♦ ♦ (the difficulty of all melee attacks) unless the opponent is incapa­ ble of resisting (in which case it might be easier at the CM's discretion). See page 204 for more details. GUNNERY (AGILITY) Many weapons are simply too large for a person to carry. In order to bring such a weapon to bear against an opponent, it may be mounted aboard a vehicle, hastily assembled where needed, or even built into a substantial defensive emplacement. Weapons of this sort might require a team to transport, assemble, and ultimately operate. Characters seldom gain experience with weap­ owns of this magnitude outside of military training. Weapons of this caliber are also difficult to acquire for anything but government entities. Only the most dangerous worlds have natural predators that require a weapon of this power as a proportionate response. Gunnery applies to laser cannons and proton torpe­ does mounted on starships. Larger mounted weapon systems like heavy laser tur­ rets and ion cannons are also fired using this skill. • If a character is piloting a starfighter, it may have weapons that are mounted upon it with a fixed orientation. Prior to making a Gunnery check, the pilot may need to maneuver his craft in order to achieve a firing solution. • Characters using Gunnery to fire turret-mounted weapons may need to hold their action until a pi­ lot can drive the vehicle so that targets are within the weapon’s firing arc. • Complex targeting computers and auto­ mated weapons mounts are often used with large scale weapons. Operating this equipment also falls under Gunnery. Gunnery check difficulties are determined by the distance to the target or relative silhou­ ettes, depending on the weap­ on fired. The difficulty may be modified by maneuvers the character makes and specific combat situational modifiers as described in Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat MELEE (BRAWN) All ranged weapons require some sort of ammunition and many are loud. They typically have fragile components or require regular maintenance, which may require its own set of tools. By contrast, most melee weapons are inexpensive, virtually si­ lent, and require little maintenance and no power beyond the strength of their wielder's limbs. Virtu­ ally any reasonably sturdy object can be used as a makeshift weapon, so a character who has become adept at the Melee skill can often make do with what’s available. The majority of melee weapons depend upon the wielder’s strength to inflict damage, but a few have their own energy sources. These weapons—including stun batons, vibroblades, and force pikes—are much more technically sophisticated than a simple club. However, their core principles remain the same. When a character masters the art of striking with one me­ lee weapon, the core concepts translate effectively to other melee weapons. Any military training includes at least a basic course in melee combat preparation. In addition, characters who have spent time on primitive worlds may have learned to defend themselves with melee weapons. Aristocrats and nobles, in some systems, may also learn a number of melee techniques as part of their cultural traditions. The difficulty of Melee checks is Average ♦ ♦ (the difficulty of all melee attacks) unless the opponent is incapable of resisting (in which case it might be easier at the GM’s discretion). The difficulty may be modi­ field by maneuvers the character makes and specific combat situational modifiers as described in Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat RANGED (HEAVY) (AGILITY) When firing upon a target from range, weapons that are held with two hands offer a more sta­ ble firing platform than those which are held in a single hand. These also often have longer barrels, providing a con­ sistent fire pattern out to a much longer range. In the larger space required for such a r m a m e n t s , designers can often include a significantly larger ammunition reserve and may also make the weapon far more potent than smaller weapons. This combination can yield weap­ owns that are substantially more deadly and more accurate. There are countless varieties of rifles used throughout the gal­ axy. Some are simple slugthrowers, while common blaster rifles range in size from carbines to extended barrel sniper rifles. There are also a number of unique weapons, such as the Wookiee bowcaster. Any of these different weapons depend upon the Ranged (Heavy) skill in their operation. In addition to combat uses, Ranged (Heavy) weapons are commonly used for hunting purposes. Because of this, these types of weapons are seen on frontier worlds far more frequently than Ranged (Light) weapons. Characters who are focused on their wilderness survival skills may prefer the ad­ ditional range that a rifle offers when confronting predators. • Ranged (Heavy) weapons inflict wounds upon tar­ gets by default. A subset of the weapons in this category may have a stun option, as do some specialized stun-only weapons. Ranged (Heavy) check difficulties are determined by the distance to the target. The difficulty may be modified by maneuvers the character makes and specific combat situational modifiers as described in Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat RANGED (LIGHT) (AGILITY) Many characters prefer to wield a weapon that can be effectively held with one hand, rather than carry­ ing something larger. This may be a preference based upon the ease of concealment, or it could be simply a stylistic choice. Alternatively, some individuals feel that they must be able to keep another hand free, al­ lowing them to, for example, pilot a speeder bike and fire a blaster pistol at the same time. A broad selection of weapons falls under the cat­ egory of the Ranged (Light) skill. It includes any weapon that can be fired with one hand, without the benefit of a brace or other support element. Specific examples include countless pistols, but also spears, nets, and thermal detonators. Some are so small as to be easily concealed, while others can only be wielded by the strongest of individuals. The Ranged (Light) skill reflects the hand-eye coor­ dination that a character has developed in conjunc­ tion with his intuitive grasp of wind resistance, grav­ ity, and distance. Upon first arriving on a planet, an expert in this field may wish to practice his abilities so that he can learn how the world's environs might affect them. • The vast majority of Ranged (Light) weapons in­ flict wounds against targets. Those that are ca­ pable of inflicting strain are specifically indicated and typically must be adjusted for use in that fir­ ing mode. • Characters may wield a Ranged (Light) weapon in each hand, or wield a melee weapon that can reasonably be used one-handed and a Ranged (Light) weapon in the other hand. See page 210 for more information. Ranged (Light) check difficulties are determined by the distance to the target. The difficulty may be modi­ field by maneuvers the character makes and specific combat situational modifiers as described in Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat KNOWLEDGE SKILLS T he actions that a character takes are often per­ formed in reaction to his knowledge about a situa­ tion. Players can never be expected to know as much about life in the game setting as the characters who have lived there. Knowledge skills serve to bridge this gap. They enable a player to make decisions about his character’s actions that are informed by what his character might know. O <$>. <§> and ^ may be spent with similar results among the different Knowledge skills. Additional & represent the character recalling information or completing research with remarkable haste, while O may be spent to learn extra trivial information about the subject. (£) may be spent to learn relevant, beneficial infor­ mation concerning the subject, perhaps an understanding of a beast’s particular weakness in the case of Knowledge (Xenol- ogy), or information concerning the familial strife between crime syndicates in the case of Knowl­ edge (Underworld). <§> may be spent by the CM to allow him to omit a vital detail about the subject at hand, while ^ may be used to seed the character with misinformation and outright false­ hoods. CORE WORLDS (INTELLECT) Those worlds closest to the Galactic Core are gener­ ally considered to represent the pinnacle of galactic culture and civilization—especially by those who dwell within these systems. Cultural traditions vary substan­ tially from system to system and even between plan­ ets within a given system. A few notions are particu­ larly common among the worlds of the Core, but even with those, there are distinct exceptions. Perfectly acceptable behavior on one planet may represent grossly disruptive manners on another, even within this culturally distinct region of the galaxy. Many hyperlanes connect the Core Worlds with the other portions of the galaxy. Because of this, visitors from foreign worlds are far more common here than in many other places. The Core Worlds represent cen­ ters of trade and diplomacy that can connect planets in disparate portions of the galaxy. • If a character needs to identify a person’s planet of origin without asking, he may make a Core Worlds check to recognize traits of his accent, dress, and mannerisms that are associated with a particular world. • When interacting with someone from a Core World, a character might make a Core Worlds check to know what behaviors are considered necessary and polite, as opposed to ones that could be offensive. • Characters who specialize in the transport and delivery of goods may make a Core Worlds check to identify which markets are the best places to sell or purchase a particular cargo. They may also recognize any worlds where such goods could be illegal. The difficulty of a Core Worlds check is generally proportionate to the rarity of the information in­ volved. Common knowledge about Coruscant is far easier to recall than an obscure fact about a subsect on a minor moon. EDUCATION (INTELLECT) Among most of the races and cultures of the galaxy, achieving literacy is a crucial first step towards adult­ hood. Even on the wildest cultural fringes of the Outer Rim, most individuals achieve at least this standard long before they reach physical maturity. Once lit­ eracy is attained, an individual’s education generally expands to cover additional areas of expertise. Typically, this includes at least a basic grounding in the mathematics, the basic sciences, and enough un­ derstanding of engineering principles to perform ba­ sic repairs. Many also study the basics of philosophy, politics, and galactic history. From there, an under­ standing of the various dominant species and cultures across the galaxy provides a complement to a well- rounded education. Characters must often rely upon these essentials in order to appropriately interact with the broader galaxy. To the uneducated, places beyond their home seldom make sense. Basic cultural variances may be­ come overwhelming challenges. • Any time a character needs to interact with a gov­ ernment entity, an Education check may be made to identify the best way to proceed. • If a character needs to employ basic scientific knowledge in an analysis, his understanding of this field is represented by his Education skill. Education also represents a default Knowledge skill. Any time a question comes up that doesn't ob­ viously fall under one of the other Knowledge skills, Education may be used to represent the character's understanding of a particular subject matter. The difficulty for an Education check is typically best represented by the rarity of the data in question. Characters who have a reference document at hand may receive substantial bonuses, but even using such a work requires an understanding of core principles. LORE (INTELLECT) Parts of the galaxy have been inhabited for more than a million years. During that time, countless civiliza­ tions have arisen and many have gone extinct. Those civilizations that achieved interstellar travel commu­ nicated with one another and shared their histories. Over the millennia, some of these tales changed and grew into myths and legends. Many have a strong ba­ sis in truth, so much so that some of these stories still conceal a potential for tremendous profit. Characters with a particular interest in lost cultures and ancient legends may decide to try to turn this in­ terest into a profession. Forgotten fleets, abandoned mines, and failed ventures all could be the sources of tremendous profits if recovered and restored. Other times, a character might stumble across an artifact connected to one of these legends—an item whose value could far exceed its initial appearance. Knowing enough to exploit that connection—either in selling the item or in tracking down its origins—might enable a character to substantially decrease the severity of his Obligations. • Any time a character needs to decipher an an­ cient piece of writing or identify its context, this requires a Lore check. • A character’s knowledge of the legends associ­ ated with the exploits of an ancient hero is repre­ sented by the Lore skill. A Lore check’s difficulty is assigned by the obscu­ rity of the information. Well known legends may not even require a check, but the tales of a race that died out millennia ago may be nearly forgotten. OUTER RIM (INTELLECT) The systems of the Outer Rim are filled with inde­ pendent worlds, often inhabited by those who enjoy their isolation and relative freedom. Because of this, the varied worlds exhibit an incredibly diverse mix of different cultures and political systems. In many in­ stances, they also exhibit a broad spectrum of differ­ ent species that have developed a shared community founded on this diversity. Because the range of cultures is so great, anything learned about the culture of one world is not nec­ essarily relevant to aspects of other systems in the Outer Rim—even ones that are relatively close. How­ ever, there are common attitudes and archetypal settings that are consistent throughout this region of the galaxy. Further, those who travel regularly among these worlds do get to learn of one another, and there are countless dives frequented by those who ply the spacelanes. • If a character needs to find a planet with a par­ ticular resource or service among the systems of the Outer Rim, he could make an Outer Rim check to identify the most appropriate and clos­ est options. • When determining the best location to sell a car­ go of goods, an Outer Rim check might reveal lo­ cations where the goods are legal, desirable, and socially acceptable. • At times when a character must interact with a person from an Outer Rim world, this knowledge skill could be used to determine the most appro­ priate social actions to take to establish a benefi­ cial relationship. The difficulty for an Outer Rim check is based upon the obscurity of the world and goods in question. This may also be modified based upon the specificity of the question posed. UNDERWORLD (INTELLECT) In some places, criminal elements control the govern­ ment through less than legal machinations. In others, the crime families function as the only effective ruling force. In more traditionally governed areas, seedier elements are dependent upon secrecy and decep­ tion as the core elements of their practices. Before a character can even begin to establish contacts among a world’s criminal elements, he must first understand which of these organizational structures are in play. Once a character deciphers how he might estab­ lish a contact, he must next find out with whom he needs to speak. Different groups or individuals might control different parts of the criminal trade. A contact for gambling is likely different than one who deals in illicit pharmaceuticals, while a third individual is likely the point of contact for military grade weapons. De­ pending upon a character’s needs and the criminal elements active on a world, finding the right contact could be trivial or extremely time-consuming. • The Underworld skill may be used to know which nearby worlds are the best locations for a particu­ lar type of illegal business. • A familiarity with Underworld may be useful if the characters need to determine the most common methods that an opponent might use for a par­ ticular type of criminal activity. When the criminal nature of a location or individual is well known, recalling the relevant data should be easy. The difficulty of the task should be much more challenging if the individual has gone to lengths to conceal his illegal activities. XENOLOGY (INTELLECT) The motivations, biological origins, and philosophies of the galaxy's varied species are hugely divergent. An object that is desirable to members of one spe­ cies could be repugnant to another. Even within a species, the cultures from different systems can have completely different ideological and social practices. Those who have mentally catalogued the different species of the galaxy and learned their distinctive traits are skilled at Xenology. Anyone who must regularly interact with the inhab­ itants of the galaxy's varied worlds must become ad­ ept at Xenology. This is particularly vital for anyone who might need to offer medical treatment to mem­ bers of varied species, as differences in basic anato­ my and biochemistry can make drugs effective in one species lethal to another. Knowledge of the varied cultural traits is also vital for a character who interacts in a social fashion. A bargaining tactic that is perfectly effective against a Twi’lek might be disastrous when used on a Wookiee. • When a character first encounters a member of an unfamiliar race, a Xenology check may be made to identify the typical way to interact with that character socially. This may be used to avert any major gaffe. • If a character needs to either help or harm a member of another species, Xenology may assist him in identifying a type of injury or in pointing out a characteristic vulnerability. • Different species need substantially different en­ vironmental conditions and foodstuffs. A Xenol­ ogy check may allow a character to offer the ap­ propriate considerations to a guest. The difficulty for a Xenology check should be based upon both how often the acting character interacts with the members of the species in question and the relative rarity of that species. KRANDAK: A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING Some of my test subje--ah, I should say, friends--ask me why I went to medical school. "Krandak,"they say. "Don't Trandoshans relish the hunt? Savor the thrill of the pursuit, the kill? Don't years ofbook learning seem... well... boring?" The truth is, they have missed their mark. Many of my fellow Trandoshans prefer a more... direct ap- proach to hunting prey, it is true. However, I find my years of higher education have only enhanced my abilities. After all, anyone can pull out a blaster and gun down their foe. But did you know that one well-placed blow of 2.5 kilograms can crush a Human trachea, or severing the lateral calve tendons on a Gundark can completely immobilize it? Did you realize that a Duros can die of blood loss in less than one minute from a single puncture to the upper pelvic aorta? I argue that a proper medical education is one of the best investments an up-and-coming bounty hunter or hired gun can make. TALENTS ‘All who gain power are afraid to lose i t ’ Even the Jedi." -Supreme Chancellor Palpatine P layer Characters are often dislinguished by Iheir special abililies. Where a minor character might surrender to overwhelming odds, a hero is expected lo dramatically defeat his foe and triumph. Talents provide a game mechanic for a character to perform tasks w illi supei human flair and ability. These gorier ally represent specialized techniques dial a charac lei lias mastered typically through intense practice arid study, talents are lighlly linked lo a character's identity, particularly his identity as lepreseiited by his profession. A < haracler is likely to be more successful when engaged in actions lor which lie has both a skill arid a talent appropriate lot t he situation. It's important lo also note that talents are focused for situational use. Generally speaking, talents have more narrow applications than skills. A character that intends Lo use a particular skill in a broad number ol ways might be better suited by advancing the skill as opposed to learning a talent. At the same Lime, a char acter involved in a situation for which his talents are ap propriate could enjoy exceptional degrees ol success. TALENT TYPES There are many different lypes ol talents. Some are associated with an individual skill or closely related group ol skills. These lend lo be particular knacks lhal a charac ler has acquired through the process ol mas l.ering lhal skill In many cases they represent opera li.onal shortcuts corners an experienced individual knows that can be safely cut or likely patterns he can follow. Other limes, such talents arc; simply natuial abilities lhal lit in particularly well will) the use ol that skill This could be a particular mental process, physi cal knack, or a learned pattern. A number of talents are specifically associated w illi physical conflict. These combat talents rep resent techniques that a character likely learned through practice and experience. In a few instances, these abililies even seem superhuman to the uriirii bated. However, their origins generally come from rigorous training and personal experience. Many are specifically associated with the abilities required lo overcome a particularly capable opponent. Others are more focused upon avoiding the brunt of an­ other’s attacks. The nature of combat talents within a particular talent tree reinforces the archetypical nature of a particular specialization. Specializations that focus on avoiding physical conflict have fewer combat talents than those that are devoted to it. The Force Sensitive Exile tree (found in Chapter VIII) uniquely includes talents that are associated with Force manipulation. Rather than representing a modification of an individual’s natural abilities, these talents are all linked to the character's understanding of the Force. Just as some characters acquire new physical abilities, the Force Sensi­ tive Exile grows in his ability to manipulate the Force. Every talent tree offers access to Dedication. This talent is the only way that a character can increase one of his characteristics after creation is complete. It only ever appears once on each tree and generally in one of the last slots. TALENT RANKS AND PURCHASING THE SAME TALENT MULTIPLE TIMES Many trees have multiple entries for a single talent. This is because many of the talents can be learned repeat­ edly. When a character learns a talent for the second—or later—time, he gains an additional rank of the talent. With few exceptions, there is no set limit to the number of ranks that a character can possess of a given talent. Instead, a character can learn as many ranks of each talent as are present on any of his currently available talent trees. Talents that are not ranked can only be purchased a single time. If a character is advancing through a specialization tree and reaches a talent without ranks that he has already acquired from another specialization tree, then he automatically purchas­ es that talent on his new talent tree w ithout spend­ ing experience points. EX AM PLE: PUR CHASIN G R A N K E D TALENTS M a tt’s character Robin has one rank of Point Blank from the Gadgeteer talent tree. When he later selects the Mercenary Soldier specializa­ tion tree, he may purchase up to an additional two ranks of Point Blank, bringing Robin to a total of three ranks of Point Blank. However, if he had purchased the Spare Clip Talent, and lat­ er selected the Trader specialization, he would not have to purchase Spare Clip again when he reached it on the tree. TALENT TREES Any time a player wishes to select a new talent for his character, he must first make certain that it is currently accessible from one of the character’s available spe­ cialization trees. In order to navigate to a new talent, the character must have already purchased all of the preceding talents listed on the tree, so that he can draw a "line” from the top of the tree, through purchased tal­ ents, to the new talent. All such descents must follow the available lines shown on each tree. Note that for some trees, directly descending a column is not pos­ sible, because there is a break in the listing. In these cases, the character must first descend a neighboring column, and then follow the line over before moving up or down the tree to access a desired talent. TALENT DESCRIPTIONS n description for each of the talents used in Edge of the Empire follows. Every entry includes the infor­ mation required for game play: • Activation explains whether a talent is always in use (Passive) or if a character must take some sort of action in order to activate it (Active). If activation is required, the type of action neces­ sary is indicated. Some talents can be activated on other characters’ turns. If this is the case, the Activation will also include the “out of tu rn ” note. • Ranked indicates if a talent can be purchased multiple times (Yes) or only once (No). • Trees references the specialization trees that provide access to the particular talent. Note that for ranked talents, some of these trees may al­ low the character to purchase the talent more than one time. • The final paragraph details the specific game me­ chanics involved in using the described talent.

The number of compart­ ments is up to the player, but cannot be enough to hold a total encumbrance value of items more than the char­ acter’s ranks in Hidden Storage. The size of the compart­ ments are proportional to the size of the vehicle or droid in question. Most humanoid droids can only hold items equivalent in size to a one-handed weapon, whereas a silhouette 4 starship could conceal humanoids within its compartments. Any checks to detect these compart­ ments have a Formidable ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) difficulty. HOLD TOGETHER Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn) Ranked: No Trees: Mechanic The character may spend one Destiny Point to make a Hold Together incidental immediately after a vehicle or starship he has repaired this encounter takes dam­ age.

Alternatively, he can decrease the encumbrance of the item by two to a minimum of one. The bonus only applies so long as the character is using the item. If the item is ever lost or destroyed, the character may apply Jury Rigged to a new personal weapon or piece or armor. KILL W ITH KINDNESS Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Politico Remove ■ per rank of Kill with Kindness from all Charm and Leadership checks the character attempts.

QUICKDRAW Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: No Trees: Assassin, Force Sensitive Exile, Scoundrel Once per round on the character’s turn, he may draw or holster an easily accessible weapon as an inci­ dental, not a maneuver. This talent also reduces the amount of time to draw or stow a weapon that usually requires more than one maneuver to properly pre­ pare or stow, by one maneuver.

REDUNDANT SYSTEMS Activation: Active (Action) Ranked: No Trees: Mechanic With an Easy (<)>) Mechanics check, the character may harvest components from a functioning device to repair a broken one, without breaking the functioning device. This allows the character to repair a broken de­ vice without having required spare parts, raw materials, or repair kits (the initial check does not suffer penalties for lacking repair kits, either). This only works, however, if the functioning device is at least the same size and technological level as the device being repaired (it is impossible to repair a starship with a blaster pistol, or a lightsaber with parts from a water wheel). RESEARCHER Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Scholar The character removes □ per rank of Researcher from all Knowledge checks. Researching takes 50% less time (this does not increase with multiple ranks of researcher) RESOLVE Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Doctor, Scholar, Slicer When the character suffers strain, he suffers one less strain per rank of Resolve, to a minimum of one.

Sniper Shot increases the maxi­ mum range of his ranged weapon up to one range band per rank. For each rank beyond the normal maximum of the weapon, upgrade the difficulty of the check by one (this is in addition to the increased difficulty of the shot due to longer range). SOFT SPOT Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: No Trees: Scoundrel, Survivalist After making a successful attack with a non-starship/ vehicle weapon, the character may spend one Des­ tiny Point to add damage equal to his Cunning to one hit of the successful attack.

To perform this action, he must have access to drugs, a medpac, or stimpacks. He makes a Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Medicine check If successful, one ally he is engaged with (including himself) increases one characteristic of the character’s choice by one for the remainder of the encounter, and suffers four strain. A single character’s individual characteristics may each only be increased once by Stim Application during an encounter. STIM APPLICATION (IMPROVED) Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: No Trees: Doctor As an incidental, when performing the Stim Applica­ tion action, the character may increase the difficulty of the Medicine check to Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) as an inci­ dental. If he does so, the target of the action suffers one strain instead of four. STIM APPLICATION (SUPREME) Activation: Passive Ranked: No Trees: Doctor When performing the Stim Application action, each (£> may be spent to increase an additional characteristic by one.

TINKERER Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Cadgeteer, Outlaw Tech The character makes one piece of equipment more modifiable. He chooses one piece of equipment and increases its number of hard points by one.

This cannot be a weapon unless the weapon has the Limited Ammo 1 quality. U TIN N I! Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Outlaw Tech The character removes ■ equal to the character's ranks in Utinni! from checks made to find or scavenge items or gear. These checks could include Negotia­ tion, Perception, or other checks, depending on cir­ cumstances and the GM’s discretion. Such skill checks take half their normal time (this does not decrease with multiple ranks of Utinni!). WELL ROUNDED Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Politico, Scholar The character chooses any two skills. They perma­ nently become career skills. WHEEL A ND DEAL Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Trader When he sells legal goods to a reputable merchant or business, the character gains an additional 10% more credits per rank of Wheel and Deal (based on the original sell price of the good or item). GEAR AND EQUIPMENT S kill, intelligence, and sheer luck are all valued assets in Edge of the Empire But only a nerf-herder enters Mos Eisley spaceport unarmed, or wanders the arctic wastelands of Hoth without insulated padded armor. Smart characters prepare themselves for the situa tions they’re most likely to encounter—and a little ex­ tra besides. Every decent smuggler knows he needs to carry a big gun to keep the rabble at bay, and a holdout blaster in case a meeting goes sour. Soldiers know most of the armor they can wear in everyday circumstances won't stop a direct blaster hit, but they also know it's a life-saver when they're caught in the outer blast of a frag grenade. A successful rogue's gear isn't all about arms and armor either. Rebreathers are invaluable for clearing mynocks off ships in deep space, and good luck fixing the.hyperdrive without a hydrospanner. • In the following chapter, players can find information on common personal weapons, armor, and gear cri'ti cal for wandering everywhere from the Core Worlds Co the fringe. They can also find out how credits some­ times come easy, and go even easier. This book cov ers most of the common equipment found throughout the galaxy. The catalog of useful tools presented here should cover most freelancers' needs. " H o k e y r e lig io n s a n d a n c ie n t w e a p o n 's a r e n o m a t c h f o r a g o o d b l a s t e r a t y o u r s id e , k id ." -Han Solo GALACTIC ECONOMICS T he life-blood of every world is its economy—what it exports and what it imports. Some trade is lo­ cal, such as the moisture harvested from the deserts of Tatooine and transported to its major cities. Other trade is planetary. Sturdy greel wood from Pn II and IV is valued throughout the Core Worlds, and Corellian spaceships are manufactured in the Corellia sector and sold and resold all over the galaxy. The trade of these goods across the spacelanes also requires legions of ships, pilots, and crews, which in turn require food, fuel, and explorers to track the fastest routes through hyperspace; they also require weapons to protect cargoes from those interested in "harvesting" that which has already been gathered. Trade federations, guilds, and local governments regulate and tax this commerce where they can. Most use this wealth to provide for the common good. Lo­ cal authorities, such as those that govern Cloud City on Bespin, empower and employ a company of se­ curity guards and escort ships for the freighters who purchase their valuable Tibanna gas. This provides employment for thousands of gas miners, traders, and technicians—and blaster gas for the entire galaxy. Of course, where there are rules, there are those who break them, and where there are tariffs, there are those who avoid them. Smugglers and black marketeers profit greatly by transporting and selling restricted or taxed goods throughout the systems. Some of these goods are of the most despicable variety, such as ad­ dictive narcotics or slaves. Some may be used for good or ill, such as weapons or explosives that might be used for anything from crime and terrorism to fighting off cruel and oppressive local regimes. Some cargoes may actually be of a heroic nature, such as those bringing medicine to a blockaded settlement or smuggling ne­ cessities to some backwater world suffering from a re­ pressive or monopolistic government. Characters in Edce of the Empire may be black­ hearted scoundrels, unscrupulous smugglers, hired guns, or ruthless bounty hunters, but some genuinely see themselves as champions for common citizens op­ pressed by their own authorities. Of course, it doesn’t hurt to have a little operating margin as well. CURRENCY Goods and services are paid for with "credits." This is a universal term for everything from local units of currency with distinctive names and denominations to the galac­ tic standard Imperial credit. All are interchangeable and can be carried as physical bills or coins, or tracked via digital cred sticks (also called "chips"). The former are most often used by criminals who don't want to leave any sort of electronic trail, or by locals on distant worlds who don’t trust institutions based light-years away. For the most part, these fears are unfounded. Cred sticks are encoded with values up to the currency limit of the planet that issued them, and backed by the In- THE ECONOMY AS AN ADVENTURE HOOK T ogether, the galactic economy is a living thing, al­ most like the Force itself. Every resource, and its transportation across planets or systems to those who want to buy it, isn't just some dry fact about a distant world—it’s a seed for an adventure. Coruscant, for example, is a world with few natural resources left for its trillion inhabitants. This means freighters loaded with food and water must travel to the planet daily to provide for its masses. The Imperial officials on Coruscant must manage these resources, providing for their officials and their fami­ lies first, and allowing additional supplies to filter down to the "rabble” living in the undercity. What happens if that supply is diminished? Imag­ ine an ambitious up-and-coming crime lord who wants to rule the Coruscant underworld. With a small fleet of pirate vessels he can secretly target some of the suppliers in the spacelanes above terCalactic Banking Clan (the ICBC). Characters can add value to a cred stick at linked branches located throughout the galaxy; these sticks are generally se­ cure. They are extremely difficult to tamper with even by the savviest slicers. Only the most elite criminal or­ ganizations can alter or manufacture fake chips, and if caught, they are dealt with immediately and severely by IGBC security forces. The bank’s rapid and draco­ nian tactics are almost always backed by the Empire, local government forces, or both. MOTIVATIONS There are two major motivators for the scoundrel-heroes of Edge of the Empire—Obligation and credits. Obliga­ tion is discussed in detail in Chapter II, and often in­ the planet, depriving the citizens below of food and water. Legions of common men and women in the streets begin to grow hungry and thirsty, and then begin to get violent. The crime lord lets the trouble rise to its boiling point. There are riots in the streets, fires in the financial districts, and battles between the mobs and Imperial troops. There are many opportunities for adventure in such an environment. The Player Characters might be hired as pirates by the crime lord, or guards for the incoming shipments. Or they might be able to reduce some Obligation with their own criminal connections by infiltrating the pirates and exposing the rival. They might even use their own smuggling skills to bring food and water to the starving people—and turn a decent profit in the process! volves financial responsibilities such as owing a debt to a Hutt crime lord. But even most scoundrels without financial Obligations are looking for a payout. Some are interested in raw credits and the easy life they think wealth will bring them. Others have their shifty eyes on a faster ship, a hidden base on a fringe world, or perhaps even a dowry for an expensive slave-bride. Most jobs the party takes on should have relatively low cash rewards (see Keeping the Crew Hungry on page I 51). Commodities such as replacement hyper­ drives, new droids, ground transport, or even space­ ships can be awarded instead—or they might be gained by taking on more Obligation (or by starting with it). This grants the party access to the tools they need to take on new adventures but avoids stockpiles of cash that would keep them from taking on new jobs. RARITY S ome items are naturally more difficult to purchase than others based on where a character finds him­ self at the time. After all, the galaxy is a big place and the vagaries and intricacies of galactic trade mean that some items that are easy to find in certain locations are very difficult to find in others. Of course, some items are rare no matter where one goes and, likewise, some items are always common and inexpensive. Rarity in Edge of the Empire is a simple way of measur­ ing how difficult an item can be to find on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the easiest to track down and 10 being the hardest. Of course, whether or not an item is available for purchase should never solely be a matter of rolling dice. Instead, the needs of the plot make it at least partially the Game Master’s decision. However, for simple items, rarity provides an easy way for the CM to determine whether something is available and let the players easily track items down. Finding an item on a world requires a Negotiate check (although the GM may allow the charac­ ter to use an appropriate Knowledge skill check instead). Table 5 -1 : Rarity lists the rarities, the difficulty of the check to find items with those rarities, and ex­ amples of items with those rarities. Table 5 -2 : Rar­ ity Modifiers lists some general modifiers that can be applied to an item’s rarity, based on location and the technological status of the world where the item TABLE 5-1: RARITY Rarity Check Examples 0 Simple ( - ) Glow Rod i Long-range Comlink 2 Easy (4 ) Medpac 3 Scanner Goggles 4 Average ( 4 4 ) Blaster Pistol 5 Blaster Rifle 6 H ard ( 4 4 4 ) Cybernetic Limb 7 Bowcaster 8 Daunting ( 4 4 + + ) Thermal Detonator 9 Personal Stealth Field 10 Form idable ( + + + + + ) Package o f Lesai is being sought. Some worlds may impose individual modifiers as well. Modifiers can bring an item’s rar­ ity above 10. At this point, the difficulty of the check remains at Formidable, but the CM may upgrade the difficulty once for every rarity beyond 10. THE BLACK MARKET Not all goods are available on all planets. A city might outlaw weapons within its limits, and most planetary au­ thorities forbid thermal detonators. Selling illegal goods is dangerous but lucrative for those with nerve. Finding them means dealing with greedy thugs and criminals. Exactly what is illegal on each world is up to the Game Master or may be specified in that world’s de­ scription. Finding an illegal item typically requires a Streetwise check. The difficulty generally depends on the rarity of the item (See Table 5 -1 ) but the difficulty can increase based on the world’s law enforcement capabilities (as determined by the GM). Selling illegal goods also requires a Streetwise check with the same difficulty as above. If three or more <§> or a ^ are rolled, something has gone wrong; the buyer tries to rob the characters or the local police arrive to arrest these brazen criminals, for example. TABLE 5-2: RARITY MODIFIERS Rarity Modifier Circumstances -2 Prim ary Core w orld such as Coruscant, Duro, or Corellia -1 O ther Core world -1 W orld on prim ary trade lane + 0 Colony o r Inner Rim world + 0 Civilized world +1 M id Rim world +1 Recently settled world, o u t o f the way world + 2 O uter Rim world + 2 Frontier world + 3 W ild Space world + 4 Uncivilized world Black market items always require a Streetwise check to find, and may cost far more than the list price de­ pending on their scarcity on a particular world. This varies from place to place, so the Game Master must determine if an item is restricted or not, to what degree, and what the difficulty is to track it down. Some items are marked with an (R) in their price, which means they are restricted and always count as black market items. Most black marketeers have established patterns, cus­ tomers, and habits that allow them to stay in business. The Player Characters might not have these connections, and may even be selling to a criminal who plans on turn­ ing around and reselling the goods again. For that rea­ son, PCs selling illegal items net one-quarter of the listed price with a successful Streetwise check, one-half with ☆ ☆ , and three-quarters with ☆ ☆ ☆ or higher. Truly exotic and illegal items, like rare animals or exotic pets, can be sold for higher values, but these are set based on the story and the difficulty it took to find them. The rules above present the general rules for buying and selling most illegal items. SELLING AND TRADING Selling legal items follows similar guidelines to selling il­ legal ones. Player Characters can generally sell an item for one quarter of its cost on a successful Negotiation check, increasing that to one-half with ☆ ☆ .a n d three- quarters with ☆ ☆ ☆ or more. There are some cases in which the PCs might wish to engage in trade; buying multiple items at one lo­ cation, then selling them at another location where they are rarer. These actions can be handled narra­ tively, but if the CM wishes to use some mechanical TABLE 5-3: INCREASED COSTS WHEN TRADING Rarity Increase Cost Increase + 0-1 XI + 2 X2 + 3 X3 + 4 o r higher X4 KEEPING THE CREW HUNGRY F or the Came Master, managing the economy can be very tricky. It’s important to encourage the crew to save for big things—a new spaceship, a bribe into a high-stakes sabacc game, or an entry fee into an inter-system race—but also keep them poor enough that they're always looking for the next big score. It's hard to motivate a party into tak­ ing a dangerous job if they’re flush with creds. One way to accomplish this is to limit the cash rewards from the missions or jobs they take on. Rather than awarding the group 10,000 credits for taking passengers to Duro or completing the Sisar Run, award them supplies for their ship. Or give them items that are not intrinsically valuable, but could pay off Obligation. A cargo of used blaster rifles might only be worth 1,000 credits, but Borga the Hutt will take it in exchange for 5 Obligation. The Came Master might also grant the party the things they want (or the things the adventure re­ quires them to have) rather than currency. If they want a bigger and better ship, for example, they might spy the vessel they want in a local pirate fleet. If they capture it, they can have it—but they’ll also be pursued by the pirate captain and crew. These tactics won’t always work, of course, and a successful group will quickly acquire a decent stockpile of creds. To keep the party cash-strapped but still allow them to save, earn, swindle, or oth­ erwise win the big prizes they’re really after, the Came Master must occasionally drain their ill-got­ ten gains (or give them chances to do the same). Carousing: When the heroes go to the next spaceport for rest and relaxation, or to gather information for their latest job, they can ca­ rouse-spending their hard-won credits on drinks, gambling, fine food, and information. This requires a Charm check. Both success and fail­ ure cost credits, but might also result in valuable leads on future jobs. The exact amount spent is set by the Came Master based on the venue, but should generally be between 50 and 100 credits. With the character learns something useful for his current situation or job, such as informa­ tion about guards, helpful contacts, or the lo­ cation of a target. With O he learns something unexpected and valuable, such as the number and schedule of his target’s guards, the location of a big score, or the name of a planet’s city or town that holds some rare item he's looking for. Each <§> rolled not only doubles the original credits spent, but likely causes trouble as well—such as a bar fight, or catching the attention of local criminals. Obligation: When the party’s (or a character’s) Obligation triggers, they may spend credits to help throw the interested parties off their tail for a short while if the Game Master allows it. This might be a bribe to a bounty hunter, a payment to a shady operative for planting a false trail, or a payout to someone who might rat them out. The exact price must be set by the Came Master, and is dependent on the nature of the Obligation and its current level. Low levels of Obligation should be relatively cheap to put off, while high levels are nearly priceless. Ship Maintenance: Ships are expensive to main­ tain. Battle damage or flying through asteroid fields can force a captain into bankruptcy if he's not careful. Rules for repairing and maintaining ships can be found on page 243. guidelines for this process, here are some basic rules covering trading. Trade works the same whether with black market (Restricted) items or with legal items. Selling the items follows the rules for selling items listed above; whether the items are black market or legal. However, when de­ termining the sell price based on the success of the Ne­ gotiation check, first multiply the cost of the item based on the difference in the item’s rarity between where the item was bought and where it’s sold, referring to Table 5 - 2 and Table 5 -3 : Increased Costs When Trading Then take the new, increased cost and determine the sell price by the results of the Negotiation check. Of course, these rules do not account for all sorts of details, such as buying in bulk, marketing and advertis­ ing, and myriad other factors that may affect prices and costs. This is why the rules for buying, selling, and trading are all modifiable by the GM, and subject to his judge­ meant. It is also important to note that these rules only apply when engaging in commercial trade. If the PCs sell a cargo load of blasters on a world using these rules, then later one of them buys a blaster on that world, he would pay the listed cost, without any increases. Remember, these rules are for engaging in trade only. Always remember when engaging in intergalactic trade that the CM has final say as to how much an item is worth, which can also be based on narrative factors. For example, if the PCs collect some E-l 1 blaster rifles off dead stormtroopers, they may try to sell them. However, though a blaster rifle is not (R), it’s still ob­ viously an Imperial weapon. Some shopkeepers may refuse to purchase them, others may offer a criminally low price for these goods, no matter how well the PCs roll on their Negotiation check. Finally, some may of­ fer to buy the goods at a reasonable price, then turn around and sell the PCs out to the Empire. ENCUMBRANCE E dce of the Empire emphasizes sweeping stories, epic tales, and fast action. Keeping track of the weight of every stimpack isn’t fun, but knowing that a hero is load­ ed down with the weapons he just stole for the Rebellion is an important story element; so is having some idea of how many days worth of rations a rogue can carry as he marches across the Jundland Wastes. In general, players and the Came Master won’t need to track a character’s encumbrance (how much he’s carrying on his person). Occasionally, however, it may play an important part in the story, and a player needs to know if the weight, mass, and collective bulk of the items his hero is wearing inhibits his actions. ENCUMBRANCE VALUES All of the gear listed in this chapter has an encumbrance value. Most items that can be commonly carried have a value of 0 through 5—from relatively light objects (such as credit chips or light clothing) to heavier items (like blaster rifles or gaffi sticks). The encumbrance value of armor is discussed in more detail later, and is different when it’s worn, where the weight is distributed appropri­ ately, and when it’s carried, when it’s just another item. Encumbrance doesn’t strictly represent weight; it also represents mass, bulk, and how easy items are to carry. A well-fitting suit of armor adds very little en­ cumbrance, while an armful of gimer sticks have a high encumbrance because they’re tricky to carry. Small items such as dataslates, most pistols, or knives have an encumbrance value of 1 or 2. Medium items, such as blaster rifles, a satchel of thermite gre­ nades, or a grappling hook and cord, have an encum­ brance value of 3 to 4. Large or heavy items such as cargo crates, repeating blaster rifles, or a heavy tool­ box, are valued at 5 to 6. If it becomes critical to the story to have more de­ tail, 10 loosely carried incidental items have an en­ cumbrance value of 1. If they are stored in an effec­ tive manner (such as bowcaster quarrels in a quiver or crystals in a pouch), then 20 incidental items have an encumbrance value of 1. If for some reason the character is unable to manage his gear in such a way, the CM may increase his overall encumbrance value by several points to reflect the difficulty in managing and carrying items by less efficient means. Living beings generally have encumbrance values of 5 plus their Brawn if carried. A typical human, like a soldier for the Rebel Alliance, has a Brawn of 2, and therefore a total encumbrance value of 7. A scholar from Caros IV, with a Brawn of 1, has an encumbrance value of 6. This may be modified by specific species’ features, such as the fatty bulk of a Hutt or the hollow bones of an avian. ENCUMBRANCE THRESHOLD Characters have an “encumbrance threshold" of 5 plus their Brawn rating, which limits how much they can carry under normal conditions and without penalty. A total encumbrance value over the threshold means the hero is “encumbered,” and suffers one ■ to all Agility and Brawn rolls for every point of encumbrance over his lim­ it. This is cumulative with any ■ dice suffered for strain or other conditions, should any be in play. Also, if a character is encumbered by an amount equal to or greater than his Brawn rating, he no longer earns a free maneuver each turn. The character can still perform up to two maneuvers, but each maneuver costs two strain. With a Brawn of 2, for example, Luke does not get a free maneuver each turn if he’s carry­ ing 9 or more points of encumbrance. LIFTING AND CARRYING EXCESSIVE ENCUMBRANCE Characters shouldn’t typically carry more than their encumbrance threshold. When necessity demands, however, they can do so for a short time (suffering the effects described above). If a character needs to lift an object greater than his encumbrance threshold, such as an ally who has fallen off a gantry or ledge, he must make an Athletics check. The difficulty is Simple if the object’s Encumbrance val­ ue is less than or equal to the character’s encumbrance threshold. Add 1 to the difficulty for every point over, up to a maximum additional encumbrance of 4 and difficulty of Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) A freelancer with a Brawn of 2 and a threshold of 7, for example, tries to lift a rock with an encumbrance value of 10. That’s 3 over, so the difficulty is Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Additional characters may help, adding their raw Brawn to the total value of the object being lifted. In the example above, a Wookiee with a Brawn of 4 adds +4 to the encumbrance threshold for that specific task. E X AM PLE OF EN C U M B R A N C E Hash and Lowhhrick have been hired to kidnap a crime lord’s assistant—a Rodian named Kappo. Low­ hhrick is trying to run with Kappo over his shoulder and has an encumbrance threshold of 9 (5 plus his Brawn of 4). Kappo’s encumbrance value is 7. Be­ tween the criminal and Lowhhrick’s bowcaster (en­ cumbrance value 5), the Wookiee is carrying 3 over his threshold, and thus makes a Hard Ath­ letics check and suffers ■ ■ ■ to all Agility and Brawn-based checks until he drops the thug. CONCEALING GEAR Characters in Edge of the Empire frequently carry small arsenals on their persons. Sometimes a character wants everyone to see the massive disruptor slung over his shoulder and the heavy blaster at his hip. knowing that intimidation can often stave off a fight. But some­ times a scoundrel needs to slip in somewhere with a little extra help, such as when Leia entered Jabba’s pal­ ace with a hidden thermal detonator. Items with an encumbrance value of I or less can be hidden on a person easily. No roll is required for successful concealment unless a foe inspects the tar­ get up close—usually with a physical patdown. In the latter case, the searcher makes an Opposed Per­ ception check against the target’s Stealth. Add □ to the searcher for every encumbrance point over 1 of the hidden item. If there are multiple items, use the highest. The Game Master should adjust this based on the situation. An unusually large species might be able to easily conceal items with an encumbrance value of 2, for example. The same rules can apply to similar situations—such as hiding a blaster rifle (encumbrance value 4) in a wag­ on of scrapped droid parts. The Game Master should decide what value of object can be hidden without no­ tice, and adds □ for every point over that. ENCUMBRANCE AND VEHICLES Ships cargo holds can house a certain amount of encum­ brance, as well. A standard cargo hold can house a wide variety of encumbrance, listed in the vehicle’s profile. Smuggling panels have varying limits. These small caches are usually secretly placed around the ship to avoid de­ tection. Most smuggling panels have an encumbrance limit of 2 to 30 depending on their size and location. COMBAT SKILLS S kills represent the ability to use, identify, maintain, and care for the weapons in each category. For ex­ ample, the Gunnery skill governs firing large mounted weapons such as a land-to-air laser turret—and is also used to diagnose problems, reset the system if it overheats, identify manufacturers, and so on. This section discusses combat skills as they relate to vari­ ous weapons. BRAWL Brawl weapons are generally light and cover the wearer’s hands. They are easy to wield in close quarters and of­ ten designed with hand-guards or grips to keep them from being dropped easily in a desperate scuffle. Ces- tus, brass knuckles, metal claws, vibrofists, and weighted gloves are all examples of brawling weapons, as are the various disciplines of unarmed combat. Many beasts and several of the more savage races fight with talons or claws, and their attacks are covered by Brawl as well. An attacker must be engaged with his target to at­ tempt a Brawl attack. GUNNERY Larger weaponry that generally requires a mount, tur­ ret, or placement to use effectively is covered by the Gunnery skill. It covers vehicle-mounted guns and most starship weapon systems, as well as stationary platforms for devices such as e-web repeating blasters, assault blasters, ion cannons, missile banks, laser turrets, pro­ ton torpedoes, and other armaments and ordnance. Gunnery weapons cannot be used against targets engaged with the weapon and its user. RANGED (LIGHT) Light ranged weapons are those that can generally be wielded in one hand, such as a blaster pistol or other handgun. Light ranged weapons also include one-hand­ ed thrown items, such as bolas, knives, or grenades. Using a light ranged weapon while engaged with an enemy increases the difficulty of the check by one. MELEE Melee weapons can be either one- or two-handed, and are generally larger than one foot in length. They vary greatly, from gaffi sticks and halberds to cortosis staves and vibroknives. An attacker must be engaged with his target to at­ tempt a melee attack. RANGED (HEAVY) Heavy ranged weapons are those that generally must be wielded in or directed with two hands, such as a bowcaster, heavy blaster, or flame projector. Heavy ranged weapons also include larger thrown items, such as spears or throwing axes. Using a heavy ranged weapon while engaged with an enemy increases the difficulty of the check by two. ITEM QUALITIES Some equipment features special qualities that add variety and depth to the vast array of armaments in the Star Wars universe. Some special qualities are inherent to certain items, while others are general qualities that can be applied by the Game Master to specifically tailor a item to the story. Special qualities are generally either passive or ac­ tive. Passive qualities are always on and require no ac­ tivation on the part of the user. Active qualities must be triggered by the user, often by spending one or more O to activate the effect. Item qualities often have a number associated with them. This is their rating. Ratings affect qualities in dif­ ferent ways, depending on the quality in question. Active qualities require O O to activate unless otherwise stated in their description. ACCURATE (PASSIVE) Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether through design or technology. For each level of this trait, the attacker adds □ to his attack dice pools while using this weapon. A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid succession and potentially spray an area with bolts, flechettes, slugs, or other types of projectiles. The ad­ vantage in using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit multiple targets or hit a single target multiple times. Attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally less accurate and the attacker must increase the dif­ ficulty of the attack check by + The user may choose to not use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case, he cannot trigger the quality but also does not suffer the aforementioned penalty. If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Auto-fire by spending O O Auto-fire can be triggered mul­ tiple times. Each time the attacker triggers auto-fire, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base damage plus the number of un­ canceled & on the check. These additional hits can be allocated to the target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. If the at­ tacker wishes to hit multiple targets, he must decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if he wish­ es to hit multiple targets, his initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is two separate targets, the CM chooses which target is his initial target). The initial hit must always be against the initial target, subsequent hits generated can be allocated to any of the other designated targets. Auto-fire weapons can also activate one Critical Injury for each hit generated on the attack per the normal cost; the Critical must target the target of the specific hit. BREACH (PASSIVE) Weapons with Breach burn through the toughest armor, and are often heavy weapons or starship weapons. Breach weapons ignore one point of Armor for ev­ ery rating of Breach (meaning they also ignore 10 points of soak for every rating of Breach). BURN (ACTIVE) Weapons with Burn inflict damage over time. If the attack is successful, the target continues to suffer the weapon's base damage for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Burn rating. Damage is applied at the start of each of the target’s actions. A victim might be able to stop the damage by rolling around on the ground and making an Agility check as an action. This is an Average Coordination check on hard surfaces such as the hall of a spaceship, or an Easy (^ ) Coordination check on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage imme­ diately. Both situations assume the flame is from actual combustion rather than a chemical reaction. With the latter, there is usually little the victim can do. AUTO-FIRE (ACTIVE) The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or similar area of effect, like the detonation of a grenade or a warhead fired from a missile launcher. If the at­ tack is successful and Blast activates, each character (friend or foe) Engaged with the original target suffers wounds equal to the weapon’s Blast rating (plus an additional wound per Success as usual). In a relatively small and enclosed area, the Came Master might decide that everyone in the room suf­ fers damage. If the Blast quality doesn’t activate, the ordnance still detonates, but bad luck or poor aim on the part of the firer (or quick reactions on the part of the vic­ tims) means the explosion may not catch anyone else in its radius. However, the user may also trigger Blast if the attack misses, by spending O O O In this case, the original target and every target en­ gaged with the original target suffers damage equal to the Blast rating of the weapon. CONCUSSIVE (ACTIVE) The weapon's attack can leave the target shell­ shocked from mighty blows or punishing shockwaves, unable to perform any but the most basic actions. The target is staggered (see page 218) for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Concussive rating. A staggered target cannot perform actions. CORTOSIS (PASSIVE) Cortosis is an ore found prim arily in the Outer Rim. It is extrem ely rare and valuable, and was used prim arily during the Clone Wars against the Jedi knights. There are two varieties of Cortosis ore. The rarest versions can actually short out a lightsaber’s blade, causing it to fail temporarily. The far more common Cortosis ore is still a miracu­ lous substance, because when m olded into armor, it forms an interlocking molecular bond that is ex­ trem ely resistant to energy weapons. Weapons with the Cortosis quality are immune to the Sunder quality. Armor with the Cortosis quality makes the wearer’s soak immune to the Pierce and Breach qualities. CUMBERSOME (PASSIVE) A Cumbersome weapon is large, unwieldy, awkward, or heavy. To wield a Cumbersome weapon properly, the character needs a Brawn characteristic equal to or greater than the weapon’s Cumbersome rating. For each point of Brawn the character is deficient, he must increase the difficulty of all checks made while using the weapon by one. BLAST (ACTIVE) Defensive weapons are particularly good at fending off incoming melee attacks. A character wielding a weapon with the Defensive quality increases his me­ lee defense by the weapon’s Defensive rating. DEFLECTION (PASSIVE) An item with the Deflection quality increases the wearer's ranged defense equal to its Deflection rating. DISORIENT (ACTIVE) A weapon with Disorient can daze an opponent. When Disorient is triggered, the target is disoriented (see page 218) for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Disorient rating. A disoriented target adds ■ to all skill checks he performs. ENSNARE (ACTIVE) A weapon with Ensnare binds a foe and restricts his movements. When Ensnare is triggered, the ta r­ get is immobilized (see page 218) for a number of rounds equal to the weapon’s Ensnare rating. An Ensnared target may a tte m p t a Hard (4 + 4) Athletics check as his action on his turn to break free from the effect. An immobilized target cannot perform maneuvers. GUIDED (ACTIVE) Certain types of projectiles may benefit from course alterations after being fired—such as guid­ ed missiles. If a character misses while firing a Guided weapon and if Guided activates, he may make an attack check at the end of the round. The difficulty of the check is calculated by comparing the weapon’s silhouette of 0 to the silhouette of the target (see page 235), and the check’s A b il­ ity dice equal the weapon’s Guided rating. If the test is successful, the weapon strikes the target and damage is dealt normally. Guided requires O O O to activate, unless other­ wise specified in the weapon’s description. Remem­ ber, the Guided effect can activate on its subsequent attacks, representing the projectile continuing to track the target. “Spoofing” is a countermeasure designed to work against the particular projectile—such as flares de­ signed to draw off an infrared missile. Spoofing direct­ ly increases the defense of the target against attacks with the Guided quality. DEFENSIVE (PASSIVE) When knockdown triggers, the target is knocked prone. Unless specified otherwise, Knockdown requires O O to trigger, plus one additional O per silhouette beyond one. INACCURATE (PASSIVE) Inaccurate weapons are weapons of a shoddy or infe­ rior construction which means they are less likely to be accurate or precise. Alternatively, the weapon’s nature may inhibit accuracy. Inaccurate weapons add ■ to the attacker’s dice pool equal to their Inaccurate rating. INFERIOR (PASSIVE) An Inferior item is a lackluster example of its kind, representing shoddy and poor craftsmanship. An In­ ferior weapon generates automatic <§> on all checks related to its use, and has its base damage decreased by one. Inferior armor has its encumbrance increased by one and its defense decreased by one. If it does not have defense, decrease its soak value by one to a minimum of zero. ION (PASSIVE) Ion weapons are designed to affect electrical systems as opposed to dealing raw damage. They are fitted to ships to knock out opponents’ shields, sensors, and engines. They are shorter range than laser weapons, and deal larger amounts of damage, but their damage is dealt to the target as system strain (usually on vehicles). It is still reduced by armor and soak. Droids are affected by ion weapons, taking damage to their strain threshold. LIMITED AMMO (PASSIVE) Some weapons fire particularly large or complex pro­ jectiles that cost significant amounts of credits, or are themselves a complete weapon that once launched is expended. A weapon with the Limited Ammo quality may be used to make a number of attacks equal to its Limited Ammo rating before it must be reloaded with a maneuver. In addition, each shot expends one of a limited number of rounds of ammo, which must be pur­ chased or otherwise obtained before the weapon can be used. This also applies to grenades and other “one use" weapons which have the Limited Ammo 1 quality (here, the user is not "reloading” the grenade, but drawing an­ other to use—but mechanically they are equivalent). LINKED (ACTIVE) Some weapons, like the laser cannons fitted to the Z-95 Headhunter, are designed to fire together at the same target. This increases the possibility of a hit as well as the damage dealt. When firing a linked weap- KNOCKDOWN (ACTIVE)on, on a successful attack, the weapon deals one hit. The wielder may spend O O to gain an additional hit, and may do so a number of times equal to the weapon’s linked rating. Additional hits from linked weapons may only be applied against the original tar­ get. Each hit deals the weapon’s base damage plus total # scored on the check. PIERCE (PASSIVE) An attack made with this weapon ignores one point of soak for each rank of Pierce. If the weapon has more ranks of Pierce than the target’s total soak, it com­ pletely ignores the target’s soak. For example, Pierce 3 against a soak of 2 ignores 2 points of soak, but the extra "point” of Pierce has no further effect. PREPARE (PASSIVE) Weapons with this quality require time to set up be­ fore being used. The user must perform a number of preparation maneuvers equal to the weapon’s Pre­ pare rating before making attacks with that weapon. SLOW-FIRING (PASSIVE) Slow-Firing weapons tend to be large, heavy, emplace­ ment-mounted weapons like the turbolasers found on capital ships, or planetary defense ion cannons. While they deal incredible damage, they need time to re­ charge or cool down between shots. A weapon’s Slow- Firing rating dictates how quickly the weapon can be fired after an attack. For example, a heavy turbolaser with Slow-Firing 2 must wait two Rounds after being fired before it can be fired again. STUN (ACTIVE) A weapon with Stun causes strain to the target. When the Stun quality is activated, it inflicts strain equal to the w p a n n n ’'; Stun ratinp STUN DAMAGE (PASSIVE) Some weapons deal Stun damage instead of regular damage. In this case, the weapon deals damage as strain instead of wounds. This damage is still reduced by a target’s soak. A variant of this is a Stun setting. As a free action, the wielder can choose to switch the setting of his weapon to “Stun.” In this case, it does stun damage as described above. When weapons with a stun setting are used to deal stun damage, their range changes to short and cannot be increased. SUNDER (ACTIVE) When activated, the attacker chooses one item open­ ly wielded by the target (such as a weapon, shield, or item on a belt). That item is damaged one step: to Minor if undamaged, from Minor to Moderate, or from Moderate to Major. If a weapon already suffer­ ing Major damage is the target of a successful Sunder, it is destroyed. Sunder requires O to activate. If activated multiple times in the same attack, each can be applied against the same weapon, potentially taking a weapon from undamaged to destroyed in a single attack. SUPERIOR (PASSIVE) A Superior item is a sterling example of its kind, rep­ resenting masterful craftsmanship. A Superior weap­ on generates automatic O on all checks related to its use, and has its base damage increased by one. Superior armor has its encumbrance reduced by one and its soak value increased by one. TRACTOR (PASSIVE) Instead of firing searing beams of laser fire or crackling ion discharges, this weapon fires relatively harmless elec­ tromagnetic beams that ensnare ships and hold them fast in space. Tractor beams, like all weapons, are fired at their target using a the appropriate skill check (generally Gunnery) with all suitable modifiers. Once the weapon hits its target, the target may not move unless its pilot makes a successful Piloting check with a dif­ ficulty based on the tractor beam’s rating. The tractor beam’s rating is always noted in parenthe­ ses in the weapon’s stats next to the quality. VICIOUS (PASSIVE) When this weapon scores a critical injury or hit, the character adds ten times the Vicious rating to the crit­ ical roll. With Vicious 3, for example, the victim adds + 30 to his critical hit result. WEAPON CHARACTERISTICS E ach weapon has a variety of characteristics which define its abilities and make it distinct. All weapons share several characteristics, while many feature spe­ cial qualities that add additional rules to its operation. NAME The general name of the weapon. This may be a broad label that applies to several closely related weapons. SKILL USED (SKILL) The combat skill used when attacking with this weapon. BASE DAMAGE (DAM) The base damage the weapon inflicts. This is the mini­ mum damage inflicted if the attack with this weapon hits. Each net & generated during the attack check adds one point of damage to this base damage rating. RANGE The range of the weapon. Range is measured in several broad range bands. Melee weapons require the attacker to be engaged with the target. Ranged weapons have ranges listed as short, medium, long, or extreme. CRITICAL RATING (CRIT) Indicates the number of O required to trigger Criti­ cal Injuries using this weapon. If the weapon's critical rating triggers, the character rolls percentile dice on the corresponding Critical Injury chart to determine the effect on the target. A Critical Injury can only be triggered on a successful hit that deals damage that exceeds the target’s soak value. Some weapons and talents modify this Critical Injury roll, potentially making a Critical Injury more or less ef­ fective. In addition, a character can only generate one Critical roll per hit on a target. However, if the roll gener­ ates enough O to trigger the critical rating of the weap­ on multiple times, the character can choose to add + 10 to the critical injury roll for each subsequent trigger. EXAM PLE: M ULTIPLE CRITICAL INJURIES Hash the smuggler fires his blaster at a Rodian mer­ cenary, generating a total of three Critical Injuries! Hash rolls one Critical, but adds + 20 to the result. ENCUMBRANCE (ENCUM) Encumbrance is, in essence, an abstract measure­ meant of how heavy and awkward something is to carry and transport. The higher the encumbrance, the more difficult the item is to carry. More details on en­ cumbrance can be found on page 152. HARD POINTS (HP) Many items can be customized; the extent deter­ mined by the number of hard points they have. The vast m ajority of weapons have a limited number of hard points that determine what attachments can be mounted on them. This is covered in greater detail on page 1 87. PRICE The price of the weapon on the open market. An (R) next to the price means the weapon is restricted and cannot be bought on the open market, in which case the price listed is the closest average black market price. RARITY The rarity of the item, before modifiers (page 1 49). SPECIAL These are the qualities or other special rules each weap­ on possesses. More in-depth descriptions of these quali­ ties can be found on page 154, while rules specific to a certain type of weapon are described in the weapon’s description, starting on the following page. WEAPON MAINTENANCE I nvariably, weapons start to wear down. Rolling ^ re­ sults may indicate a weapon has malfunctioned, mis­ fired, jammed, broken down, or otherwise been ren­ dered inoperable or impaired until it can be repaired. Low-tech weaponry that generally does not rely on energy cells or sophisticated programming (such as a bowcaster or gaffi stick) can be repaired with the Mechanics skill, or the corresponding skill used to wield the weapon. More sophisticated weapons that AMMO T he weapons in Star Wars are primarily en­ ergy-based. That, coupled with the action- packed and narrative-based gameplay in Edge of the Em pire, means that players do not need to track ammunition for their characters' weap­ owns. They are always assumed to have enough power packs or clips to handle whatever fire- fights they encounter. This carries over to prim­ itive weapons such as slugthrowers. There are a few exceptions to this, of course, the primary one being weapons with the Limited Ammo Quality. This Quality is used to represent weapons with deliberately limited clips such as missile tubes and proton torpedoes, as well as one-use weapons such as grenades or nets. Another exception is when weapons do run out of ammo, such as when a combat check generates a Despair symbol that the GM spends to make the character's ammo run out. In these cases, the weapon is out until the end of the encounter, un­ less the character thought ahead and brought along extra reloads (see page 181). rely on programming, circuitry, or electronics (such as a laser turret or missile launcher) can also be re­ paired with the Computers skill, or the correspond­ ing weapon skill (although Mechanics can always be used to repair a weapon). Weapon repairs are generally classified as Minor, Mod­ erate, or Major. The magnitude of the required repairs in­ dictates two things—the severity of any penalties applied to the user when trying to operate the defective weapon, and the difficulty rating of the necessary repairs. Repair- TABLE 5-4: REPAIRING GEAR Repair Required Difficulty Rating Penalty for Use M ino r ♦ O ne additional Setback die. M oderate ♦ ♦ One ad ditiona l D ifficulty die M a jo r ♦ ♦ ♦ Unusable ing a weapon requires adequate time and tools, gener­ ally one to two hours per difficulty level. If a character attempts repairs in less time, he increases the difficulty by one. Likewise, if the character lacks the proper tools, he increases the difficulty by one. These factors are cumula­ tive, so when repairing a blaster without the proper tools and in less time, the difficulty is increased by two. The cost of the repairs is equal to a percentage of the weapon’s base cost, 25% if it’s a minor repair, 50% if it’s a moderate repair, and 100% if it requires major work. Reduce the total by 10% for each Advan­ tage received on the Repair roll if the character is do­ ing it himself. (A Non-Player Character weaponsmith won’t reduce his price for his skill.) This does mean it’s sometimes easier to buy a new weapon than fix an existing one, but that isn't always possible. It also doesn’t include the price of any modi­ fications that have been made, which aren’t figured into the repair cost. E X A M P L E REPAIRS Pash’s fancy pistol has suffered a major malfunc­ tion. The base cost of the pistol is 1000 credits, so it costs him 250 credits to make a minor repair, 500 to make a moderate repair, and 1000 to make a major repair. Unfortunately, he’s far away from his contacts in the Black Sun criminal organization—where he originally purchased this weapon—so he ventures into the local town for 1000 credits worth of parts. heavy repeaters. All use a gas chamber filled with some sort of combustible vapor (such as Tibanna gas from Bespin) as their propellant. When the weapon is fired, the gas is pushed through a second chamber that “excites” the gas. The next compartment con­ verts the gas into particles, which are then focused through a crystal of some sort. The end result is a particle stream that can tear through everything from flesh to light metal. Blaster technology is ubiquitous and easy for those with even a little skill with devices to manufacture, mod, and repair. WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS T he galaxy is filled with strange and wondrous devices. A large number of them are designed to blast, obliterate, or at the very least intim idate their wielder’s foes. Below are the weapons most common to those who take up life on the fringe and the adversaries they are likely to encounter. BLASTERS The most common type of weapons in the galaxy are blasters. They come in a seemingly infinite array of shapes and sizes, from small “holdout” pieces to TABLE 5-5: RANGED WEAPONS N a m e S k ill □ a m C r it R a n g e Encum H P P r ic e R a r i t y S p e c ia l Energy Weapons Holdout Blaster Ranged (Light) 5 4 Short 1 1 2 0 0 4 Stun setting Light Blaster Pistol Ranged (Light) 5 4 Medium i 2 300 4 Stun setting Blaster Pistol Ranged (Light) _ 6 5 Medium l 3 4 0 0 4 Stun setting Heavy Blaster Pistol Ranged (Light) 7 5 Medium 2 3 700 6 Stun setting Blaster Carbine Ranged (Heavy) 9 5 Medium 3 4 8 5 0 5 Stun setting Blaster Rifle Ranged (Heavy) 9 3 Long 4 4 9 0 0 5 Stun setting Heavy Blaster Rifle Ranged (Heavy) 10 3 Long 6 4 1,500 6 Auto-fire, Cumbersome 3 Light Repeating Blaster Ranged (Heavy) 11 3 Long 7 4 (R) 2,2 50 7 Auto-fire, Cumbersome 4, Pierce 1 Heavy Repeating Blaster Gunnery 15 2 Long 9 4 (R) 6,0 00 8 Auto-fire, Cumbersome 5, Pierce 2, Vicious 1 Bowcaster Ranged(Heavy) 10 3 Medium 5 2 1,250 7 Cumbersome 3, Knockdown Ionization Blaster Ranged (Light) 10 5 Short 3 3 250 3 Disorient 5, Stun Damage (Droid only) Disruptor Pistol Ranged (Light) 10 2 Short 2 2 (R) 3,0 00 6 Vicious 4 Disruptor Rifle Ranged (Heavy) 10 2 Long 5 4 (R) 5,0 00 6 Cumbersome 2, Vicious 5 Slugthrowers Slugthrower Pistol Ranged (Light) 4 5 Short 1 0 100 3 Slugthrower Rifle Ranged (Heavy) 7 5 Medium 5 1 250 3 Cumbersome 2 Thrown Weapons Bola / Net Ranged (Light) 2 - Short 1/3 2 20 2 Ensnare 3, Knockdown, Limited Ammo 1 Explosives and O th er Weapons Flame Projector Ranged (Heavy) 8 2 Short 6 2 1,000 6 Burn 3, Blast 8 Missile Tube Gunnery 20 2 Extreme 7 4 (R) 7,500 8 Blast 10, Cumbersome 3, Guided 3, Breach 1, Prepare 1, Limited Am m o 6 Frag Grenade Ranged (Light) 8 4 Short 1 0 50 5 Blast 6, Limited Am m o 1 Stun Grenade Ranged (Light) 8 NA Short 1 0 75 4 Disorient 3, Stun Damage, Blast 8.

Blasters with this ability have it noted in their special qualities, listed as “Stun Setting." Stun beams may only be used at short range, no matter what the weapon’s normal range is. Switching between "Stun” and “ Kill” on such a weapon is relatively simple, and requires an incidental. A person might also purchase a blaster that can only fire on Stun. These are sometimes called "stingbeams" or simply “stun blasters.” The late Senator Bail Prestor Organa of Alderaan carried such a weapon, as do the rare pacifists or bound­ ty hunters who like to bring their prey back alive with no accidents. Blaster carbines and all pistols (except heavy blasters) can be purchased as stun blasters, with a cost equal to half the usual amount for the regular version.

What they sacrifice most is range, due to their short barrel and lesser charge. Add ■ to a char­ acter’s Perception check when attempting to find a hold­ out pistol on a person's body. Models Include: Imperial Army Scout Trooper Blast­ er Pistol, Merr-Sonn Q2 Holdout. LIGHT BLASTER PISTOL A good compromise between concealment and pow­ er, light blasters are favored by those who often need a firearm—but just as often need to pretend they don't. Smugglers, spies, and rogues who don’t want to advertise their shadier side are all likely to carry light blasters. Smaller-framed species tend to favor light blasters as well, simply for their weight and con­ venience relative to their own body mass. Models Include: Merr-Sonn Model 44 Blaster Pistol, BlasTech DL-18 Blaster Pistol. BLASTER PISTOL Most spacers carry standard blaster pistols. They pack enough punch to penetrate plastoid armor, have decent range, and are light enough to carry around at all times. Most scoundrels also appreciate the gun­ slinger-style look of a well-used blaster on their hip. Spacefarers who often have to fight aboard ship car­ ry these weapons since the blast is effective against many types of armor, but isn't powerful enough to breach the hull of most vessels. Models Include: BlasTech DH-17 Blaster, BlasTech SE-14 and SE-14C Blaster Pistol. Heavy blasters are for those spacers who definitely want everyone to know they're packing. They’re very powerful, sacrificing range, subtlety, and concealment for intimidation and the ability to tear big holes in most anything short of a blast door. Heavy blaster pis­ tols are intended to combine the strength of a blaster rifle with the compactness of a pistol. Though they do not quite succeed at either (being slightly weaker than a blaster rifle and bulkier than a pistol) they still pro­ vide an excellent and deadly compromise weapon. Their only major drawback is that they carry fewer shots than either, a trade-off for the increased power. Came Masters have the option to spend <§> <§> <§> or ^ to force a heavy blaster pistol to run out of ammo (see page 207). Models Include: BlasTech DL-44 Heavy Blaster Pis­ tol, Merr-Sonn Model 434. BLASTER RIFLE / CARBINE The rifle or carbine blaster is the typical firearm of soldiers and heavy security forces around the galaxy. Their longer barrels propel bolts much farther than blaster pistols, and their heavier cartridges typically trigger a more powerful blast of particles. Stormtroopers in service of the Empire carry E-11 blaster rifles with folding stocks. At short range, the rifle can be fired one-handed—just as if it were a heavy pis­ tol. The stock is extended when firing at more distant targets so that the trooper can better stabilize his aim. Models Include: E-11 Blaster Rifle (multiple manu­ facturers), BlasTech A280 Blaster Rifle. HEAVY BLASTER RIFLE Hunters and snipers often carry blaster rifles loaded with particularly powerful accelerant gas, advanced XCiter technology, large focusing crystals, or some combination of all three. They're designed to fire ex­ tremely powerful bolts at large or heavily armored tar­ gets and can fire rapid bursts of shots. Heavy blaster rifles are also excellent for sniping humanoid targets. The massive damage they cause sends a powerful message to the victim's associates. Models Include: BlasTech DLT-19, BlasTech RT-97C Heavy Blaster Rifle. LIGHT REPEATING BLASTER Light repeaters are support weapons for m ilitary and mercenary units. They feature a high rate of fire and are designed to suppress and injure unar­ mored personnel. The hail of "light" produced by these rapid-firing weapons is often enough to force enemies to ground. Models Include: BlasTech T-21 Light Repeating Blaster. HEAVY BLASTER PISTOL These deadly weapons are designed to destroy light machinery, armored targets, or opponents in light cover. Heavy repeating blasters (such as the E-Web blaster favored by Imperial stormtroopers) are truly support weapons. They are set up on tripods and pow­ ered by portable generators. They require a two-man team, with one soldier serving as the gunner and the other handling the generator and power couplings. In military units, the second operator often monitors a communications array attached to the generator for selection of targets. Heavy repeaters are far too unwieldy to fire effec­ tively without a tripod, unless the bearer has truly remarkable strength. Setting up a tripod weapon re­ quires the crew to spend three actions. The cost of the weapon includes a tripod such as the one found on page 1 93. Models Include: BlasTech E-Web Repeating Blaster. BOWCASTER Bowcasters are associated with the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. They are as distinctive to the Wookiees as gaffi sticks are to the Sand People. The various quarrels that can be fired from these weap­ owns allow the wielder a great range of options. Standard ammunition consists of metallic bolts accelerated by po­ larizers astride the barrel tip. This increases the power and velocity of the round so that the heavy projectile reaches ranges equivalent to conventional blasters. The standard quarrel is a micro-explosive capable of blasting through armor, metal, or thick flesh—like that of the giant creatures native to Kashyyyk. Other types of quarrels include sonic detonators, flash quar­ rels that stun and blind, or smoke quarrels designed to create cover for advancing Wookiee warriors. Every bowcaster is hand-built for its user—hence the exorbitant cost. Most require significant strength to cock, but automatic re-cocking mechanisms are one of the most common modifications (Chewbacca’s bowcaster has automatic re-cocking, as well as a low-light scope). The bowcaster presented here fires standard micro­ explosive quarrels, and does not have an automatic re-cocking mechanism. It requires the user to spend a maneuver cocking the weapon before each shot. Models Include: Unique designed weapon. IONIZATION BLASTER These anti-droid weapons work by combining the power pack of a blaster rifle with a typical droid restraining bolt. Somewhat contrary to its name, the bolt doesn't disable a droid mechanically, but instead attaches to its housing and issues a broadcast command to halt that cannot be refused. The ionization blaster amplifies the HEAVY REPEATING BLASTER command via the blaster's power pack to a range of about 1 2 meters in a wide, unfocused arc. Organic life forms feel no more than a brief sting, but droids are blasted with the halt command and simultaneously overloaded with energy that prevents any shielding that might resist it. Most droids are ren­ dered inert for up to half an hour when hit by a suc­ cessful ionization blast (reflected in the stun damage). Ionization blasters work only on droids and cyborgs, and only deal strain damage as per their Stun quality. They have no effect on organic beings beyond a brief and painful sting. Models Include: Jawa scavenged ion blaster, Merr- Sonn DEMP 2 Ion Carbine. DISRUPTOR RIFLE/PISTOL Illegal throughout most of the civilized worlds, disrup­ ters focus such a highly energized beam of particles that they can disintegrate limbs or other large parts of their victim's bodies. The technology is essentially that of a blaster rifle, but with an oversized XCiter and a specialized actuating module that processes a much higher volume of blaster gas than usual. This combines with a galven cylinder that super-focuses the resultant beam. Most disrupter weapons have a very poor range, although some rifle variants have a boosted range through expensive reinforced galven cylinders and are designed specifically for snipers and sharpshooters. The Tenloss Syndicate manufactures one of the few mass-produced disrupters, the DXR-6 rifle and the DX-2 pistol. Their main client is the notorious Black Sun crimi­ nal organization, but they also service a smattering of ruthless rogues and other scoundrels. A few Imperial in­ quisitors and interrogators have been known to brandish these weapons as well, but perhaps more for the intimi­ dation and terror factor than their practicality. Whenever a victim is hit by a disrupter, any Critical Hit results in a "Crippled” effect unless the roll on Table 6 - 1 0 would result in an even more grievous injury. Disrupters may never benefit from upgrades or attach­ ments that improve their range or grant multiple shots. Models Include: Tenloss DXR-6 Disrupter Rifle, Ten- loss DX-2 Disrupter Pistol. SLUGTHROWERS Considered the weapons of “backwater" worlds, slugth- rowers are nonetheless easy to make, manufacture, and repair in places with little infrastructure or technology. The basic premise is simple—some kind of propellant is encapsulated within a sealed cartridge. When the accel­ erant is detonated, it propels a slug of some sort—usu­ ally metal—through the weapon's barrel. The size of the slug and the power with which it’s propelled determines its stopping power, while the length of the barrel and whether or not it’s rifled (which spins the slug) directly impacts the projectile’s range and accuracy. Despite the bias most have against these “antiquat­ ed” weapons, snipers and assassins often use slugth- rowers. While the slugthrower is loud and most emit smoke at the point of origin, they are still far more difficult to trace in darkness than the bright blazing bolts of blaster fire. SLUGTHROWER PISTOL Short, compact, and loud, these small weapons are very rare. Those who wield them frequently do so because they have some sentimental value, perhaps handed down to them from some distant relative from a low-tech world, or because these weapons are all that’s easily available on their world. Models Include: Oriolanis Striker Projectile Pistol. SLUGTHROWER RIFLE A larger version of the slugthrower pistol, the slugth­ rower rifle also uses chemical reactions to fire a solid projectile “slug” at high velocities towards a target. Slugthrower rifles sport much longer and larger bar­ rels than pistols, and can fire larger slugs over longer distances. However, they still suffer from poor accura­ cy and penetration, not to mention requiring uncom­ mon ammunition that may either be hand-made and unreliable or prohibitively expensive. However, many primitive and nomadic cultures use slugthrower rifles, often of some homemade variant. One such example are the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine. The primitive and violent nomads have little access to the kind of gas used by blasters and even less to XCit- er technology. They are able to occasionally capture ammunition in raids on the planet's moisture farms, however, and use the rounds in their crude, long- range sniper rifles. These weapons are quite effective against the lone settlers, diminutive Jawas, and womp rats that share their harsh desert. Models Include: Dresselian Projectile Rifle, Czerka Arms 6-2Aug2 Hunting Rifle. BOLA O R NET Sometimes a bounty hunter has to capture a foe alive rather than dead. Bolas and nets are both used to en­ tangle a victim so that he can be approached and se­ cured—usually for delivery to an authority or criminal organization. Both weapons are designed to be thrown or launched over short distances to ensnare an oppo­ nent. Although a stun weapon is easier to use, bolas and nets do have several advantages. Their low-tech construction means they are unlikely to show up on weapons scanners, and stun weapons have sometimes been known to deal lasting damage to a target. Bolas and nets rely on the Ensnare quality of the weapons to incapacitate the user, meaning they re­ quire more than simply a successful hit. Due to the great deal of skill required, only those who are very talented or extremely desperate tend to use bolas or nets. Most individuals rely on the stun setting of a blaster to bring their target down. The user may spend a to ensure the victim is so entangled that he may not make any maneuvers, and his only action each turn is a Formidable ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Athletics check to free himself. EXPLOSIVES AND FLAME PROJECTORS Although blasters are the most common weapons In the galaxy, many individuals use other, more esoteric weapons as well. Explosive devices, flame projectors, and other weapons may not be as ubiquitous as blast­ ers, but they're no less deadly. FLAME PROJECTOR Flame-producing devices are primarily used to de­ stroy material such as structures or crops, rather than as anti-personnel weapons. Of course, they excel at scorching flesh and bone as well. Flame projectors are popular partially because of their wide and indiscriminate cone of fire, able to catch several individuals in a gout of flame. When triggering the weapon’s Burn quality, the user may choose to apply it to any one target hit by the attack; this quality may be triggered multiple times, affect­ ing a different target each time. However, the CM can spend <§> <§> or & to apply the weapon’s Burn quality to an ally hit by the original attack. Models Include: Merr-Sonn C-22 Flame Carbine, Merr- Sonn CR-24 Flame Rifle. MISSILE TUBE Missile tubes are heavy, portable devices that launch rocket-powered projectiles. Most fire proton-charged warheads designed to destroy small transports, but other types of ammunition can occasionally be found. Missile tubes are elaborate affairs, equipped with micro-repulsorlifts that make them easier for infantry soldiers to carry, as well as advanced tracking screens to detect a target’s speed, range, and energy signature. The latter is particularly important because missile tubes can be fired in one of three modes. The first is infrared, which homes in on a craft’s heat signature. The second is gravity-activated mode, which means it tracks a target’s repulsorlift. Both of these modes can be spoofed, either by dropping burning flares to distract heat sensors or small repulsorlift pods as chaff. See the Guided weapon quality to handle these two modes of attack. The third firing method is direct-fire. This requires more skill but sends the projectile in a straight line that cannot be spoofed by chaff or flares (and loses the Guid­ ed quality). Of course, if another target happens to get in the way, or if the attacker’s aim is off, the missile will hit whatever is in its path without discrimination. Missile tubes require one preparation maneuver before firing. Models Include: Merr-Sonn PLX-2M Missile Tube. FRAG GRENADE A great variety of grenades can be found throughout the galaxy, from hand-made explosives created with organic shells on primitive worlds to mass-produced metallic casings filled with jagged shards of metal. All fulfill the same basic purpose—to cause as much damage and mayhem as possible over a large area. Frag grenades are very effective against unarmored targets, rending exposed flesh and causing massive con- cussive damage to soft tissues. They are significantly dampened by armor, such as that worn by Imperial stormtroopers. Those who wonder why the Empire’s foot soldiers wear armor that cannot stop blaster fire have likely never seen them emerge from the smoke and ruin of a frag grenade unharmed. Frag grenades can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after be­ ing activated at the beginning of the attacker’s action. Some also have a "dead man’s" or pressure switch that, once pressed, detonates immediately upon release. Models Include: Merr-Sonn C-22. STUN GRENADE Stun grenades use sonic waves, concussion shocks, and other methods to stun their targets. Like frag grenades, stun grenades can be set to det­ onate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated. Stun grenades rarely have pressure detonators. Models Include: Merr-Sonn C-10 Stun Grenade. THERMAL DETONATOR These insidious devices are the size of frag grenades, but have a thermite-baradium casing surrounding a baradium core. On detonation, the resulting fusion reaction creates a particle wave that disintegrates everything in the blast. Most authorities ban thermal detonators because of baradium’s instability. One det­ onator can level a building. When using a thermal detonator, any ^ result on the check means the detonator explodes prematurely. The wielder takes full damage from the weapon unless he can perform an additional maneuver to try to get clear; in this case, he only suffers the Blast damage. Thermal detonators can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after be­ ing activated at the beginning of the attacker’s action. Some also have a pressure switch that, once pressed, detonates immediately upon release. Thermal detona­ tors are so potent that their Blast quality affects every­ one within short range of the original target. Models Include: Merr-Sonn Class-A Thermal Detonator. BRAWL WEAPONS Weapons designed to fit directly over the fists fit into this category. Brass knuckles and shock gloves are fairly common among the rough-and-tumble outlaws of the galaxy. When using a Brawl weapon, users add their Brawn characteristic to the damage dealt, unless the weapon description indicates otherwise (the plus symbol next to the listed damage indicates that users add their Brawn to damage dealt). BRASS KNUCKLES Dirty fighters and those looking to protect their fists from the tough hides of certain alien species rely on metallic knuckles, gauntlets, or other hand or limb coverings. Hoodlums on some worlds refer to them as "negotiation enhancers." Another great advantage of brass knuckles is their ability to be concealed in a pocket or other compart­ meant until they're needed. Add one ■ die to a charac­ ter’s Perception check when attempting to find brass knuckles on a person’s body. SHOCK GLOVES Thin, metallic wires turn standard insulated gauntlets into shock gloves. Martial artists can use them to aug­ meant their brutal hand attacks, and more than a few nefarious rogues have been known to “seal a deal” with a handshake that leaves a rival convulsing on the floor. Models Include: Corellian Personal Defence X-21. MELEE WEAPONS In a galaxy full of blasters, bowcasters, and thermal detonators, melee weapons are surprisingly common. Some wielders prefer a blade to a blaster, as they know the blade is far more reliable and just as deadly in the right hands. Others know that a deadly polearm or vicious vibro-ax gives a scoundrel the confidence and intimidation factor he needs to walk into a den of thieves and murderers and come out on top. When using a Melee weapon, users add their Brawn characteristic to the damage dealt, unless the weapon description indicates otherwise (the plus symbol next to the listed damage indicates that users add their Brawn to damage dealt). COMBAT KNIFE Vicious combatants rely on sharp blades to slice and gash their foes. They’re also far easier to conceal than a firearm and just as deadly if the user is skilled in its use. Knives are seen as the weapons of commoners, thieves, and assassins, so carrying one in plain sight may cause social stigma in polite company, or add to a rogue's pres­ ence in more wretched hives of scum and villainy. GAFFI STICK The Tusken Raiders of Tatooine carry brutal staves made from desert tracti hardwood, krayt dragon horn or bone, or scavenged metal. One end of the gaffi stick is flanged with four protruding blades useful for cutting and gashing opponents. The other end curves outward and ends in a spike of some sort, with the opposite side serving as a dull club. While to some the gaffi stick seems crude, its genius is its versatility—be­ ing able to stab, cut, or club depending on how the user wields it. It has practical uses as well, from serv­ ing as a walking stick in the rough terrain of Tatooine to guiding the Tusken Raiders' massive banthas. Gaffi sticks require two hands to wield. FORCE PIKE Force pikes are one-meter long metallic staves topped with power-tips. One setting on the power-tip vibrates powerfully enough to shatter flesh, steel, and stone. The other setting provides an electric shock that can be set relatively low to prod or control, or high to cause excruciating pain or death. Either setting is designed for ease of use—it takes little skill to swing a stick and cause devastating injury with the vibro or electricity setting. In the hands of a skilled user, how­ ever, it's almost as powerful as a lightsaber. When used with its Stun Setting, a Force Pike does not benefit from the Pierce 2 Quality. Force pikes re­ quire two hands to wield. Models Include: SoroSuub Controller FP. LIGHTSABER The weapon of the Jedi is rare in Edge of the Em pir e. The rogues and scoundrels of the galaxy do not trav­ el in the same circles as these revered knights. When such an individual is encountered, tainted souls may want to steer clear, for their weapons are made of pure energy and can slice through anything—from limbs to blast doors. Lightsabers normally require the Lightsaber skill to wield. However, since that skill is not an option for the Player Characters in this book, players must use a light­ saber untrained (selecting either Brawn or Agility as the base characteristic). This is deliberate, because there are few people in the galaxy who properly know how to fight with a lightsaber. However, if the CM feels it is war­ ranted, he can create the Lightsaber skill as a custom skill for his players. Lightsabers cannot be sundered. TRUNCHEON Truncheons may be made of metal, wood, bone or other materials, but all fulfill the same basic func­ tio n-bruising flesh, breaking bones, and cracking skulls. Police forces around the galaxy use truncheons to intimidate and control protestors or petty thieves. Enlightened areas prefer this to lethal force. VIBRO-AX Camorreans, particularly those employed by the notori­ ous Hutts, often carry meter-long axes fitted with vibra­ tion technology. Most are very heavy and suited only for beings of considerable strength, and usually with a low center of gravity (particularly tall or elegant beings have trouble swinging the heavy axes without throwing themselves off-balance). The damage a vibro-ax causes is tremendous and messy. The impact area suffers massive and deep trau­ ma from the blade and the vibration. Because of this, wounds caused by vibro-axes are particularly nasty— hence the high damage and Critical Hit chance. A vibro-ax requires two hands to wield. Models Include: SoroSuub BD-1 Cutter Vibro-Ax. VIBROKNIFE A vibroknife is essentially a modded combat knife, but since they have proven so effective, they have be­ come manufactured as such throughout the galaxy. The basic premise is simple—a small but powerful device within the knife’s handle vibrates the blade at an incredibly high frequency so that it essentially acts as a miniature saw. Vibroknives aren’t as powerful as lightsabers against most substances, but one need not be a Jedi to wield it effectively. Models Include: Merr-Sonn Treppus-2 Vibroblade. VIBROSWORD Many galactic civilizations have long taken to improv­ ing the simple but effective blade with induced ultra­ sonic vibrations. The high frequency vibrations of the cutting edge greatly improve the sharpness of the weapon, allowing it to carve through most materials with ease. There are many variations of vibroblade, but the vi- brosword is fairly common amongst those who fancy themselves duelists. Models Include: Merr-Sonn Damask-4 Duelist Sword. ARMOR F ew heroes and villains of the galaxy wear armor because most weapons can penetrate it. But it’s no guarantee, and having laminated armor or even a thick leather coat offers some protection against glancing blaster bolts or the rusty weapons of some backwater world’s inhabitants. Some, like Imperial stormtroopers, also wear armor as a uniform. Their full-body suits not only protect them from area-effect weapons like frag grenades, but also dehumanize them to some extent, presenting a unit­ ed face to the worlds the Empire attempts to bring under their rule. ARMOR CHARACTERISTICS Whether it’s a blast helmet or a vest, all armor has the following characteristics in common. Armor also shares some characteristics with weapons, notably cost, encumbrance, hard points, and rarity, the de­ scriptions of which can be found on page 1 58. DEFENSE The armor’s defense adds ■ equal to the rating di­ rectly to the attacker’s pool. This reflects the armor’s ability to deflect damage away from the user’s body. SOAK Soak is added to the target’s Brawn and subtracted from any incoming damage suffered. If an attack causes 10 damage, for example, a soak of 2 plus a Brawn of 2 reduces the damage by 4 to a total of 6. ENCUMBRANCE Each armor set has a listed encumbrance. This is the encumbrance value of the item when carried. However, armor is designed to be worn, and when worn, its en­ cumbrance value decreases. Reduce the encumbrance value of all armor by 3 when worn. ARMOR TYPES Below is a list of the most common armor types found throughout the galaxy. HEAVY CLOTHING A good leather jacket, technician’s jumpsuit, or thick woolen cloak won’t stop much damage, but it’s certainly better than nothing. Most characters living on the edge of the Empire favor heavy clothing for everyday wear. ADVERSE ENVIRONMENT GEAR Anyone traveling outside the civilized planets of the galaxy should make a point of packing some form of hostile environment gear. Clothing for hot, des- \ ert environments often includes voluminous robes, goggles, headwraps, self-cooling packs, and water recyclers. Clothing for cold environments often con­ sists of insulated parkas, quilted and layered pants, ice- goggles, and head-gear. Characters with this gear may ignore ■ imposed by the environment they find themselves in. The gear must be appropriate to the environment at hand. Models Include: Pretormin Environmental Froz 350 and ScorSear 200 complete gear sets. PADDED ARMOR Local forces and soldiers of the Rebel Alliance often wear padded armor, woven with tough, energy-resistant fibers. It tends to absorb and resist some of the power of a blaster bolt, although it often proves little use against a solid hit. It does, however, provide reasonable protec­ tion against blows or concussive damage, providing pad­ ding against such shocks. It also has the advantage of being relatively comfortable; many individuals can wear padded armor without generating too much attention from local law enforcement on frontier worlds. Models Include: TaggeCo. "Protector X” Law Enforce­ meant Armor. ARMORED CLOTHING This category of armor covers light vests, jackets, or pants plated with plastoid or ceramic pads, sometimes with mesh energy-dispersion layers. This armor type is very light but covers the most important vital organs. These plates are mostly undetectable as long as the clothing is reasonably bulky. An Average Per­ ception check detects that a person’s clothing is plated. However, the plates woven into the fabric do not just provide absorption against blows, they also serve to deflect some shots away from vital areas entirely. Models Include: Tenloss Syndicate “ShadowStalker” Assassin Gear. LAMINATE (STORMTROOPER ARMOR) Imperial stormtroopers wear fully-enclosed plastoid armor that deflects and negates incoming damage. It won’t stop a direct hit from a blaster, but is rea­ sonably effective against indirect concussive damage and shrapnel. It typically includes vision magnifica­ tion and integrated comlinks to others attuned to the same frequency. As the armor is designed to work TABLE 5-7: ARMOR Type Defense Soak Price Encumbrance Hard Points Rarity Adverse Environment Gear 0 i 500 2 i i Armored Clothing i i 1.000 3 i 6 Heavy Battle Arm or i 2 (R) 5 ,0 0 0 6 4 7 Heavy Clothing 0 1 50 1 0 0 Laminate 0 2 2 ,5 0 0 4 3 5 Personal Deflector Shield 2 0 10,000 3 0 8 Padded Arm or 0 2 500 2 0 1 with powered systems, it can be easily modified with after-market attachments. Laminate armor is worn over a tight-fitting body glove. This system offers significant insulation, making it easier to operate in all environments. For extended service in extreme environments, more specialized versions are made. Models Include: Imperial Department of Military Re­ search Stormtrooper Armor. HEAVY BATTLE ARMOR Certain heavy stormtroopers, bounty hunters, and even droids are fitted with heavy armor. Ostensibly, heavy armor protects against most normal blaster shots, but in the arms race of offense versus defense, the offensive power of a good blaster is still far ahead of most anything a humanoid can wear. Heavy battle armor can be sealed and provide the same benefits as full-body laminate armor as above, or it can take the form of a heavy vest and blast helmet. Models Include: Mandalorian Shock Trooper Armor. PERSONAL DEFLECTOR SHIELD Though rare, bulky, and difficult to use, personal deflector shields are one of the few defenses that can stand up to blaster fire. De­ flector shields use limited ray/ particle shielding that deflects and blocks incoming projectiles. They are difficult to use because the power drain is extraordinary, meaning they only work for a limited length of time. When the wielder is using a personal deflec­ tor shield, the CM can spend any ^ the wielder generates to have the shield run out of power for the remainder of the encounter. The shield has enough power to last about ten minutes. Re­ charging a deflector shield re­ quires three hours and electrical facilities. Modern galactic companies do not generally produce per­ sonal deflector shields. The tech­ nology to make one that does not emit enough radiation to kill an organic user is very rare, and those that exist are almost always custom-built. GEAR I t might not be as exciting as a blaster or snubfighter, but basic equipment is often the foundation for a suc­ cessful attack or business venture, especially when these are one and the same. Reliable communications, survival on inhospitable worlds, repair for recalcitrant droids, even keeping allies alive after things have gone horribly wrong are all impossible if insufficient attention was paid to outfitting personnel beforehand. After all, even a good blaster won't do much if its power pack fails. COMMUNICATIONS Given the scale at which many operations are con­ ducted, solid communications are of vital importance. There is a wide range of devices for such purposes to create reliable and even secure messaging between individuals or groups. Not all are simply a matter of ranges; some requirements can call for quiet and subtle comms for surreptitious actions, or ultra-tight comlinks to evade others attempting to listen in. COMLINK A common device found across the galaxy, comlinks come in a variety of forms depending on their function and user. Each allows for audio messaging between two THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE JOB I n the Edce of the Empire system, each unique piece of gear does not always provide a unique bonus to gameplay mechanics. This is due to the narrative nature of the system. Instead, many pieces of gear aid the user in difficult tasks. A pair of macrobinoculars may make seeing something far away easier, for ex­ ample. Whenever a character uses a piece of gear to aid in a task he could perform anyway, the GM and player can agree to add ■ to the dice pool. Sometimes, gear allows tasks that would be impossible otherwise. For example, two char­ acters can communicate via comlink when over 100 kilometers apart, which would be impossi­ ble normally. In these cases, the gear does not add additional bonuses, as it is simply enabling the task to occur in the first place. Finally, some pieces of gear do offer specific bonuses or benefits in certain situations. In these cases, the benefit and when it applies is listed in the entry. This is in addition to the benefits described in the prior two instances. p a r t i e s , though ad vanced models can transmit to multiple users or net- ______ work groups together. Personal comlinks are often small, hand-held cylinders capable of communicating over distances into low orbit. Some models are built into helmets and armor segments. Longer-range versions are usually carried as large satchels or in backpacks, and can reach across a planet and to ships in high orbit (or even elsewhere in the same star system). Most operate on a standard set of frequencies that can be adjusted as desired to elude detection. HOLO-MESSENGER Usually reserved for formal affairs or the dealings of the wealthy, these small, disk-like devices create holographic recordings or transmissions that may be played back as a small projection. The user can easily hold a holo-messenger in one hand. Though uncom­ mon, they have played an integral part in many re­ venge or entrapment schemes. POISONS Poisons have been used to kill or incapacitate for un­ told centuries, even if they are generally considered devious and unethical. They come in all forms and styles, from skin application to respiratory vector to simple food additives. The average poison simply kills within minutes, leaving clear signs of unnatural death. CONSUMABLES I n the midst of planning for hostile actions or hyperspace jumps, it's also good to plan for the next meal. A hold filled with Kessel spice is extremely valuable, but if the ship has no ra­ tions, the smuggler won't survive to sell it. Not all consumables are used to sustain life, how­ ever. Poisons serve to kill or disable foes, while alcohols like Corellian ale can incapacitate as well—albeit in a much more enjoyable manner. There are possibly more types of alcoholic bev­ erages than any other type of food or drink in the galaxy. Most are created as a byproduct of natural chemical reactions involving plant mat­ ter, though synthetic variants do exist as well. Depending on the world and culture, alcohol can be illegal, religiously taboo, included as ritual custom, commonplace, or even an established part of daily life. The prices vary wildly as well. Likewise, food comes in a wide variety of types. From simple but hearty gorba melts, to foul palp wafers, to synthetic protato wedges, to the crab-stuffed creampuffs of the Mon Cala- mari, there is something in the galaxy for ev­ eryone, no matter the palate. Meals can range in cost from the incredibly inexpensive to the inordinately luxurious and costly. Therefore, listing a single price for food or drink would be impossible. However, purchasing food or drink should seldom come up in a game, unless it adds to the narrative of the story. The cost of a drink in a cantina likely doesn't matter to the overall plot of a game, but raising enough money to go to a fancy dinner (and meet a pro­ spective target for a heist) would. SYNTHETIC STANDARD STRENGTH NEUROTOXIN This is a general poison synthetically produced on hundreds of worlds (often illegally) that affects the biochemical reactions of most creatures, sometimes fatally. This poison may be introduced into the target’s body via aerosol deployment, food ingestion, or injec­ tion (via an applicator or dart). Resisting a single dose has an Average difficulty, while two or more doses combined into a single application have a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) . difficulty The poison inflicts 5 wounds if the target fails the check. Each <§) generated inflicts one strain on the target as the effort of fighting the poi­ son overwhelms him. Finally, the CM can spend ^ to make the target test against the poison again during the next round, as the poison remains in his system. SYNTHETIC STANDARD STRENGTH ANESTHETIC This is a general anesthetic produced on many worlds for medical procedures, designed to render the user unconscious. Unsurprisingly, many crim i­ nals have found it valuable. This poison may be introduced into a target’s body via aerosol deploy­ meant, food ingestion, or injection (via an applica­ to r or dart). A single dose has an Average 4 ) difficulty, while two or more doses combined into a single application have a Hard + 4 ) diffi­ culty The poison inflicts 5 strain if the target fails the check. If the check generates one to two <§>, the target must also give up his free maneuver dur­ ing his next turn (he may still take two maneuvers, however); if it generates <§> <§) <§> or more, he’s staggered during his next turn. Finally, the CM can spend ^ to make the target test against the poison again during the next round, as the poison remains in his system. SYNTHETIC STANDARD STRENGTH NEUROPARALYTIC Poisons that paralyze a target but leave higher cog­ nitive functions intact (and do not kill the target) are difficult to create and administer. However, certain types do exist. This poison may only be introduced into a target via injection, as in an applicator or dart. Any sized dose has a Hard diffi­ culty. The poison Stuns the target for 3 Rounds if the target fails the check. In addition, each <§> gen­ erated inflicts one strain on the target, and the CM can spend ^ to make the target test against the poison again during the next round, as the poison remains in his system. Higher-quality poisons leave no trace and can be tuned so that the victim dies at a specific time, while poorer versions are unreliable and might only cause severe indigestion or illness. Some poisons do not kill their target, but can cripple them in unpleasant ways. There are a wide variety of poisons, far more than can be listed here. However, each poison has several rules- based components. Poisons always have a Difficulty list­ ed; this is the Difficulty of the Resilience check the victim must make to avoid the effects. Poisons also always have an effect listed; this is the consequence for failing the Re­ silience check. Generally this has two parts: the primary effect, and the secondary effects that may be triggered from additional <§> or The following are several broad types of poisons. These may go by many names or many different for­ mulations on different worlds, but their broad effects and applications are the same. CYBERNETIC ENHANCEMENTS/ REPLACEMENTS Technology is an integral part of life on almost every world in the galaxy, and for some it is an integral part of their very bodies. Some cybernetic enhancements are visible, either because the wearer cares little about what others might think of his mechanical prosthesis or because he cannot afford better. Others are near-perfect duplicates of lost limbs or are hidden within the body, and few could tell the difference without scanning devices. Cybernetic enhancements and replacements gen­ erally increase skills or characteristics, providing raw bonuses to characters' abilities. The combination of purchased increases and the increases provided by cybernetics can increase a character’s skill or charac­ teristic one step above the normal maximum (seven for characteristics, six for skills). Each character may only purchase and install a number of cybernetic enhancements and replace­ ments equal to his Brawn rating. The cybernetic enhancements listed here are obvious­ ly mechanical in nature. The exceptions are the BioTech Industries Repli-Limb Prosthetics. These do not enhance the user as the other cybernetic devices do. However, they are designed to function identically to the original limb, and to be covered with synthflesh so that they look virtually indistinguishable to that which they replace. One drawback of cybernetic enhancements and re­ placements is that they can be affected by weaponry de­ signed to disable technology, such as ionization blasters or ion cannons. If hit by weapons that normally would only affect droids, the cybernetic enhancement tempo­ rarily stops working for the remainder of the scene or until repaired. The consequences of this depend on the enhancement in question and are left up to the GM, but should make sense (for example, a character with two malfunctioning cybernetic legs would not only lose any bonuses from the legs, but would also be unable to walk). CYBERNETIC ARMS (MOD V AND MOD VI) BioTech Industries is a leading supplier of cybernetic devices across the galaxy, and its Mod V and Mod VI cyberarms are made to fit hundreds of alien species. These cyberarms are designed for increased strength (in the case of the Mod V) or manual dexterity (in the case of the Mod VI). Although intended to replace limbs lost in accidents, BioTech sees plenty of sales to those who don't mind replacing their arms with mechanical equivalents. The Mod V Cyberarm provides + 1 Brawn, while the Mod VI provides + 1 Agility. If a character replaces both arms with cybernetic enhancements, he must use the same model, as they are designed to work in tandem. However, the modifiers from both arms do not stack. Models Include: BioTech Industries Cyberarm Mod V and Mod VI. CYBERNETIC LEGS (MOD II AND MOD III) BioTech’s expertise with replacing natural limbs into su­ perior cybernetics also extends to legs. For those with the credits, the loss of such limbs does not have to mean any loss of ability and can even lead to greater mobility than before. Advanced models such as the Mod II can offer greater power, while the Mod III uses computer- guided gyroscopic implants for superior quickness. Note that cyberlegs must be purchased as a pair. Mod II Cyberlegs provide + 1 Brawn, while the Mod III provides + 1 Agility. The wearer must have both legs replaced to receive the bonus to his characteristics. Models Include: BioTech In­ dustries Cyberlegs Mod II and Mod III. CYBERNETIC BRAIN IMPLANT One fascinating invention in the field of cybernetics is the cybernetic implant, a computer device designed to augment the user’s brainpower. One example, the AjA6 implant, is a common enhancement for those who must oversee large operations or process vast amounts of data on a regular basis. The implant fits around the user’s ears and back of the head, melding with the user’s brain to achieve superior reasoning speeds as well as to store in­ formation for later analysis. The popular unit also allows for remote computer control as well as comlink capability. A cybernetic brain implant provides + 1 Intelligence and includes a comlink and computer access link. M odels Include: BioTech Borg Construct A jA6 Cy­ bernetic Implant. IMPLANT ARMOR Another product from the ubiquitous Tagge Company and other corporations, implant armor is useful for occasions where obvious armor protection might be impractical or even act as an insult to prospective business partners. These thin plates rest under the skin, where they can absorb enemy fire with little seri­ ous damage to vulnerable tissue. Implant armor provides + 1 soak. Models Include: TaggeCo Implant Armor Mod V, Bio- Tech “Duraskin” Implant. CYBERNETIC EYES Perhaps one of the most difficult cybernetic enhance­ meant is replacement eyes, for most observers can detect even the slightest error. Athakam MedTech’s line of cy­ bernetic eyes passes such inspection, with many agreeing the Mod III is perhaps their finest achievement. Although they are obviously not the user’s natural eyes, they grant the user increased visual acuity and recognition. Users with cybernetic eyes gain + 1 Vigilance and Perception. M odels Include: Athakam MedTech Cybernetic Eyes Mod III. IMMUNE IMPLANT Given the wide variety of life forms and the frequency with which many travel the galaxy, it is little wonder that diseases can become a major concern. Most have to rely on treatment or some form of local resistance meds, but these can vary from world to world. Athakam MedTech’s Immune Implant solves such problems with simplicity and efficiency through use of a subdermal wide-spectrum defense mixture, designed to protect against almost every disease known. The Mod I im­ plant is the most commonly used version, combining broad effectiveness and long-term results in a single package that rests just below the skin. Possessing an Immune Implant grants the wearer + 1 Resilience M odels Include: Athakam MedTech Immune Im­ plant Mod I. CYBERNETIC WEAPON It took six designs before the weaponsmiths at BlasTech achieved success, but the Mod VII, also known as a “ blaster arm," finally combined a realis­ tic limb with a deadly ranged weapon. The company uses outsourced cybernetic limbs as the basis for their designs, modifying them with their own propri­ etary weapon designs to form the final product. Fa­ vored by bounty hunters and assassins, the artificial forearm can split open for a short-ranged blaster to spring out and deliver a hail of shots before most foes are aware they are in danger. The standard cybernetic weapon arm appears to be a regular cybernetic arm but features a retractable light blaster pistol that can be deployed as an inciden­ tal. It is attached to the arm and cannot be removed, dropped, or disarmed. Models Include: BlasTech Industries Arms Cybernetic Weapon Enhancement Mod VII, Athakam MedTech Synthlimb Blaster. CYBERSCANNER LIMB This cybernetic arm does far more than simply replace a limb; it also includes a basic scanner for medium range detection. The CyberScanner displays data on a holo-projector that appears above the user’s open palm and can show nearby motion, life-forms, energy signatures, and other common targets as desired. The Mod IV Scanner Limb incorporates a portable scanner, and unlike most cybernetics, is concealed by a synthflesh covering to disguise the fact that there is anything out of the ordinary about the limb. Models Include: Neuro-Saav Technologies CyberScan­ ner Limb, NeuroFabritech ScanMaster Arm. PROSTHETIC REPLACEMENTS Given the often violent nature of the galaxy and the dangerous weapons used to settle many disagree­ ments, many losers (and winners) of such conflicts of­ ten wind up with fewer fingers, arms, or legs than when they started. Others might have internal organs de­ stroyed or ruined eyes. While cloning technology and flesh regenerators can be used to repair such losses, few use this option, as it is expensive and often highly illegal. Instead, many opt for mechanical replacements. BioTech Industries' Repli-Limb Prosthetic Replace­ ments are some of the more popular options. These cybernetics are designed to provide identical function­ ality to the original limb or organ, and are installed with a synthflesh covering, making them almost indis­ tinguishable from the organic component they replace. Limbs and major organs (including sensory organs such as eyes and ears, as well as heart, lungs, livers, and more) can all be replaced with a Repli-Limb option. They do not provide any bonuses or enhancements to the character, but restore him to normality. There are two general cost entries for Repli-Limb Prosthetics; the first is for limbs, the second for organs. However, the GM should feel free to increase or decrease the costs depending on the specific circumstances. Models Include: BioTech Industries Repli-Limb Pros­ thetic Replacements. DETECTION DEVICES Knowing the foe is only the first step—knowing what he is doing and where he is going is also important. Detection and surveillance gear helps ensure there are no unwanted visitors in the midst of illicit activities or unexpected surprises lurking in deserted areas. ELECTROBINOCULARS Electrobinoculars come in many shapes and sizes, depending on their role and the species to use them. Neuro-Saav’s Model TD2.3s, for example, are electri­ cally powered and allow for high levels of magnification in zoom and panoramic views. They also offer vision in very high or very low levels of light, thermal imag­ ing, and (in more expensive versions) recording and playback modes. Informational overlays also provide distances, elevations, and velocities of sighted targets. Electrobinoculars allow the user to see normally in low light or extremely bright conditions, and can mag­ nify targets up to ten kilometers away. When using electrobinoculars, characters may also remove up to ■ imposed due to long range or poor light. Models Include: Neuro-Saav Model TD2.3 Elec­ trobinoculars, Fabritech "Longsight," TaggeCo. Model 3 Imperial Army. MACROBINOCULARS A far simpler version of the more complicated elec­ trobinoculars, macrobinoculars use rugged imaging systems to magnify far-off objects for their users. They are more reliable than electrobinoculars, because there are few systems that can break down. However, they sacrifice the image enhancement and record­ ing systems, as well as any low light capability. There are countless macrobinocular brands on the market, though most of the differences are purely cosmetic. Models Include: Numerous Variants. SCANNER GOGGLES Simpler than electrobinoculars, scanner goggles en­ hance vision through a blend of light amplification and thermal imaging. They are common in illegal and combat situations, as they do not require extra effort or hands for their operation. Scanner goggles allow the user to see normally in dark conditions. Models Include: Fabritech X-2000 Scanner Goggles, Torjeka B3, TaggeCo. Luminator. GENERAL PURPOSE SCANNER Most scanners are small, hand-held gear, designed to be simple and durable for field use by scouts and explorers. Depending on the model, they indicate the nearby presence of life forms, heat fonts, radiation sources, acoustic emissions, or any com bination thereof. Some operate in all direc­ tions, displaying th eir results on screens or holo- displays, while others are directional and only give indications towards where they are pointing. The Cryoncorp EnhanceScan is a typical example of this. Small enough to be carried by a single scout, the scanner has life-form tracking, motion sensing, metal detection, and the a bility to intercept stan­ dard frequency com link transmissions. The motion sensing operates up to half a kilometer, while the remaining systems can detect targets up to a kilo­ m eter and a half, and the com link interceptor can catch signals from much further. Models Include: Cryoncorp EnhanceScan General Purpose Scanner, Crozo Industrial Mineral Scanner, CUE GenScan. HAND SCANNER "Hand scanner" is a catchall designation for a wide variety of handheld scanning devices designed to run specific-purpose scans. Some of the most common versions of these are medisensors, such as the RFX/K Medisensor made by BioTech Indus­ tries. The device can be used independently or plugged into a medpac or datapad, and displays a variety of useful bio-signs about the subject. Other scanners can check for atmospheric contaminants, poisons, vermin, or in the case of mechanics, m i­ cro-fractures or stress points. Models Include: RFX/K Medisensor. SURVEILLANCE TAGGER These small (less than three centimeters across) bea­ cons are commonly placed on their target via darts or other surreptitious means, where they use adhe­ sion or magnetism to stay affixed. Once in place, they relay information such as location, direction, and rate of movement to their user, making them invaluable for tracking an unwitting foe. The most ex­ pensive models, such as the Rhinsome Tracking Corp SureSnoop, can relay information through obstruc­ tions over dozens of kilometers, while the cheaper Astroserver Industries Rover and Trailmaster and the MechBlaze Observer tend to have much shorter broadcast ranges and can be blocked by large build­ ings or thick masses of rock or metal. Models Include: Rhinsome Tracking Corp SureS­ noop, Astroserver Industries Rover and Trailmaster, MechBlaze Observer. MEDICAL Finishing off a particularly profitable run is worth little if no one lives to enjoy the credits. Having adequate medical gear helps ensure one is always ready for his next deal, no matter how badly the previous one went. Many of these items are designed to augment and en­ hance (or simply permit the use of) the Medicine skill. BACTA Bacta is a liquid used for healing, made of an artificial­ ly grown bacteria developed thousands of years ago. It is nothing short of miraculous, working on a wide variety of species and healing terrible wounds with little or no scarring. It is commonly used in large tanks for total immersion, but can also be administered in pre-treated patches, injection, portable pouches, and even through direct consumption. While full-size bac­ ta tanks are rare outside of major installations, some ships often have portable tanks, and most medpacs and field kits have bacta patches. Bacta provides greatly accelerated healing rates, as described on page 220. Models Include: None. EMERGENCY MEDPAC Medpacs are common even on those ships that do not engage in activities of dubious legality, for even those with little medical training can use the contents to treat injuries and save lives. Most ships carry sev­ eral, and they are a common component in most sur­ vival gear. Standard medpacs contain field dressings, bacta patches, basic drugs, antiseptics, medical tools and knives, blood coagulators, synthflesh applicators, and more, all designed for ease of use and fast pa­ tient stabilization. The GLiS (General Life-Sustaining) also has a limited diagnostic scanner to monitor a pa­ tient’s vital signs, and a computer that can provide treatment options. The intention of this medpac is to allow for basic first aid in the field. Medpacs allow characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty, as detailed on page 219. Models Include: Athakam MedTech Survival Med­ pac, Chiewab GLiS Emergency Medpac. MEDPAC Slightly larger and infinitely more advanced than a stan­ dard emergency medpac, the FastFlesh is a good exam­ ple of a medpac carried by a trained medic. The med­ pac carries instruments for emergency field surgery, a RECREATION/ENTERTAINMENT Life need not be endless work from one run to the next; even those who live for the next pas­ sage desire a game or other diversions to pass the time between stars. Games of chance and skill, and gambling on their outcomes, are all frequently employed to keep the mind sharp (and the credit chip full if done correctly). Dejarik: Dejarik, which uses a holographic dis­ play table to project playing pieces of real and mythical monsters, is a popular game of skill between two players. The holographic display allows the pieces to "do battle” as a part of the game, and many bystanders enjoy the holo­ graphic carnage as much as the actual skill the real players employ. Sabacc: A favorite gambling game across the galaxy, sabacc utilizes a deck of cards. Players attempt to reach some combination of 23 or -23 (or more esoteric combinations, such as a natural ” 2” and “ 3”) to win. Flowever, the cards are electronic, and randomly shift and swap to different cards during play. This means sa­ bacc is a game of bluffing and brinksmanship as much as it is one of skill and logic, and tricks such as counting cards are almost impossible. Chance Cubes: Chance cubes are six-sided dice cubes with red and blue sides. They allow for simple gambling in which players bet on the potential results. Their simplicity makes them popular on frontier worlds or long expeditions, where more complicated entertainment would be more likely to malfunction. better diagnostic computer and mediscanner, advanced synth-nutrient replicators for sustaining a patient's vital nutrients, spray splints, and counter-radiation and bio­ logical poison drugs. This medpac allows the user to perform relatively complicated medical procedures in the field, and can rival the infirmaries on smaller starships. It allows characters to attempt to heal others using Medicine checks without penalty as described on page 219, and additionally grants a □ on all attempts. In ad­ dition, the internal stim storage grants the user the equivalent of one stimpack per scene (although the GM can rule the device has run out of stims if the sup­ plies are used continuously). Models Include: Athakam MedTech First Responder, BioTech FastFlesh Medpac. STIMPACK Stimpacks are auto-injection tubes filled with medi­ cine, bacta, and painkillers. They are field-ready emergency health recovery products, and useful for quick healing in the field. There are countless makers of stimpacks, from Chiewab Amalgamated Pharma­ ceuticals to Athakam MedTech. It takes a maneuver for a character to inject a st­ impack in himself or another. Stimpacks are one-use items, and automatically heal 5 wounds. Characters can use stimpacks more than once, but each use heals one less wound (so the second use heals four, the third use heals three, and so on). The sixth stim­ pack heals no wounds—the character is already over­ saturated with the medicine for it to have any effect. It takes a day for the character’s body to process the stimpacks and for him to be able to use them at full effectiveness. See page 220 for more information. Models Include: Numerous Variants. SYNTHSKIN, SYNTHFLESH These artificial flesh coatings are used both to treat injuries and to coat cybernetic limbs. Synthskin is more commonly used to bond with real tissue, usually to aid in recovery, while synthflesh is more often used to cover mechanical devices to make them appear or­ ganic; these can include entire droids when a realistic appearance is desired. As with stimpacks, synthskin is made by countless companies, although BioTech In­ dustries is a leading manufacturer in the field. Synthskin applications can be used as first aid to treat cuts and bruises. Synthskin applications are one-use items. Models Include: Numerous Variants. SECURITY Security is a two-fold operation. On one side, there is the goal of securing one’s own data, credits, or other value­ ables. On the other is the goal of penetrating vaults, data storage barriers, and other secured physical or electronic bastions. Such a battle between protection and access can flip back and forth; once a security attack goes well, the next step is usually to secure whatever is taken, lest it become the target of someone else’s attack. COMM JAMMER Where there are people wishing to communicate, there are people wishing to prevent it, and thus there are jam­ mers. Smaller versions can shut out local signals, while others are so powerful as to cut entire planets off from the rest of the galaxy. The Miradyne "Hail” is one of the former, a relatively portable device that can blanket standard comlink frequencies over a quarter-kilometer radius. It can also focus on a single target (such as an individual building) from up to three kilometers away. Cutting through the noise created by a comm jammer requires a Computers check, with a difficulty proportional to the distance from the jammer and the power of the de­ vice. The closer and more powerful the jammer, the harder the difficulty. The "Hail" forces an Average check, which becomes more difficult at close ranges (the exact difficulty is up to the GM, but should increase to Hard or Daunting if at medium range or closer to the device). Models Include: Miradyne 1 x-Hail Comm Jammer. DISGUISE KIT Despite what are undoubtedly stunning features (or because of them), there are many times when an in­ dividual needs to look less like himself. Disguise kits contain the means to make this happen, with makeup, false hairpieces, iris chromatics, and even falseprint skins and DNA cloaks in advanced kits. Other kits can contain practical camouflage gear for urban and field settings, for blending into surroundings rather than with other people. There are numerous disguise kits made across the galaxy, especially since many must be made for a specific type of species. However, they all contain similar materials and share similar costs. Models Include: Numerous Variants. ELECTRONIC LOCK BREAKER The galaxy is filled with security devices to keep valuables protected or secured. A good thief knows that the stron­ ger the security, the more valuable the items inside, and the greater the desire to make them his own. Many locks across the galaxy have complex electronic systems that far surpass the simple mechanical locks of old. Electronic lock breakers like those made by the fancifully named OutlawTech (a group of slicers and criminal technicians) are automatic anti-security slicing systems that can hack through most standard electronic locks. There are also much more advanced models that require no skill on the user’s part and can defeat the most complicated locks. Models Include: OutlawTech Electronic Lock Breaker, BINDERS Restraints come in many forms, but all are designed to keep a conscious prisoner subdued and manage­ able. Basic binder cuffs are strong enough to keep a Wookiee under control and are part of any bounty hunter’s standard kit. Binders are made by a variety of different companies, such as Locris Syndicated Se­ curities, although most follow the same basic design. Breaking free of binders is often a matter of either sheer brawn or impressive agility and flexibility. The difficulty of each restraint is different depending on make and model, but the most common restraints re­ quire a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Athletics or Coordina­ tion check to escape. Models Include: Locris Syndicated Securities Bind-1. RESTRAINING BOLTS Restraining bolts serve the same function on droids as restraints do on other sentients. Once affixed to a droid, the bolts can override their programming. The simplest setting shuts the droid down, but restrain­ ing bolts can also force droids to perform any actions they are commanded to do by the person holding the restraining bolt controller. Standard restraining bolts are produced by the billions by companies like Indus­ trial Automation. Most droids cannot resist restraining bolts when one is attached to them (a process that requires a few seconds and a spot-welder). However, any Player Character who happens to be a droid is obviously made of sterner stuff than NPC droids. Player Char­ acter droids may make a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Dis­ cipline check to overcome the effects of a restraining bolt and act normally when the bolt is applied. They may retry the test at the CM’s discretion. Models Include: Numerous Variants. COMM SCRAMBLER Scramblers are devices used to encrypt communica­ tions for privacy or security (or both). They can be af­ fixed onto most comlinks or other similar equipment, and only those with a linked scrambler are able to follow the conversation. Their small size makes them easy to conceal, which is important since they’re il­ legal for civilians to possess on most civilized worlds. Companies like Chedak produce models like the Mark 5 primarily for military or police use, although many end up on the black market. Using scramblers adds ■ ■ to any checks to at­ tempt to decode and understand the transmission. Models Include: Chedak Mark 5 Comm Scrambler. SLICER GEAR Slicers use their formidable talents to gain access and control of computers, and items such as these are their main tools. Their main weapons are highly customized (usually to illegal degrees) computers of their own, filled with the latest decryption software, codebreakers, and data probes. Other items might in­ clude false credit chips for accessing the accounts of others or modifying monetary levels. But like slicers themselves, their tools are unique; often a slicer can identify another slicer simply by inspecting the elec­ tronic fingerprints his tools leave behind. Models Include: Numerous Variants. SURVIVAL Merely being ready to face down an enemy blaster means little when faced with no food or water and no means to easily get either. Survival gear comes into play when making long treks across untamed wastelands or desolate badlands, making the jour­ ney less hazardous. RATION PACKS As bland and flavorless as the life of an Imperial stor- mtrooper, ration packs are a common item on smaller ships used to augment or replace actual galley fare. Each can be easily reconstituted into a full meal through built-in heat infusers and limited hydration. Most ships include emergency ration packs in case of disasters such as hard landings or engine failures, and while not all are actually made for the Imperial Army, most follow the same standard make. Understand­ ably, ration packs are one-use items. Models Include: Imperial Army Ration Packs. BREATH MASKS AND RESPIRATORS Not all planets or environments are hospitable to all spe­ cies, and thus many species require breathing devices to survive on them. The most basic are simple nose plugs which filter out contaminants; there are also higher qual­ ity items such as wearable face masks with gas canisters, filtration masks for poisonous atmospheres, and even aquatic rebreathers for sustained activity underwater. The Candorthral Atmospherics Roamer-6 is a fair­ ly simple variant stored aboard many starships that filters harmful atmospheres and provides additional gases to produce a proper oxygen-nitrogen mix. Oth­ er variants (especially those made for alien species who must spend long periods of time in hostile atmo­ spheres) can be more unobtrusive or comfortable to wear, but essentially do the same thing. Breathing aids can be set to provide nearly any atmosphere, although oxygen-nitrogen atmospheres are the most common. Some variants of Gand, how­ ever, use rebreathers to inhale an ammonia mix that mimics the atmosphere of their home planet. Models Include: Gandorthral Atmospherics Roamer-6. SPACE SUIT Space suits are vital for anyone who plans to travel in space. Space suits also come in handy when exterior repairs are needed between departure and arrival, or when stepping out into a totally unknown atmosphere. The TaggeCo. Standard X (actually made by a dozen secondary manufac­ turing and distribution factories on Kuat, Fondor, Bilbringi, and Corellia) is a popular model for nu­ merous starships or space stations. It does not in­ clude long-term life support, but is useful for short spacewalks. It includes small thrusters to aid in movement, magboots for adhesion in weightless­ ness, a comlink, and m icrotool fittings. Like most suits, it also comes with repair packs to seal suit tears or gasket leaks. Models Include: TaggeCo. Standard X Space Suit. CRASH SURVIVAL KIT While life is usually controlled and comfortable, there are many times when physical survival be­ comes an issue. A forced landing m ight strand a crew deep in Tatooine's deserts, or a speeder fail­ ure could result in extended durations in glacial snow. M ost ships, especially smaller ones such as fighters and escape pods, contain kits to help ensure survival until rescue or repair. Pretormin Environmental (a company specializing in explo­ ration and survival gear) makes a popular model of survival kit small enough to fit into an escape pod or snubfighter. Their contents include a th er­ mal cloak, m ultipurpose knife, distress beacon, two emergency comlinks, wire spool, ration bars, basic medpac (equivalent of the GLiS Emergency Medpac), two respirators, water filte r and jug, glow rod, 50 meters of high strength microfiber, ten ra­ tion packs, and a flare gun. Some pirates would augment their kits with compact blasters or other weapons, knowing that often their enemies will also be eagerly searching for them, although Pre­ torm in Environmental doesn’t equip th eir kits with weapons as standard. M odels Include: Pretormin Environmental Crash Survival Kit. TENT Tents can be found in larger survival kits, and can pro­ vide protection from the elements for one or more people. Almost any large piece of fabric can be made into one if necessary, though most would prefer dur- asilk models with internal memory supports that as­ semble themselves. Models Include: Numerous Variants. THERMAL CLOAK For those not used to extremes of heat or cold, ther­ mal protection is a must. Thermal cloaks can be worn while on the move, or used as a blanket or makeshift tent. Depending on the technical access of the user, these could be simple but effective fabric blends or ultra-thin synthetic meshes than can collapse into a pocket. Most offer support for cold environments, with more clever models having reflective materials to also aid in areas of excessive heat. Thermal blankets and thermal cloaks remove up to ■ ■ from any checks made to handle the effects of extreme heat or cold. Models Include: Numerous Variants. TOOLS Using tools separates sentients from other life forms, and using tools well often separates successful sen­ tients from the rest. Tools are used to perform specific tasks or to make performing them easier; they can be almost anything from a simple hammer to a fusion power pack and everything in between. As with weap­ owns, in desperate times almost anything can be made into a tool, though its efficiency pales in comparison to the correct item. BACKPACK A backpack can serve many important functions; it can be used for carrying survival gear or even smaller allies and droids. Most are simple affairs of fabric and straps, with better styles including internal bracing and back support so that heavier weights can be car­ ried far longer. Backpacks increase the character's encumbrance threshold by 4. Models Include: Numerous Variants. CLIMBING GEAR Though climbing gear is usually used in wilderness ar­ eas away from artificial turbolifts or simple stairs, it also can be useful in gaining entry to higher reaches through clandestine means. Most gear includes a spooled length of syntherope or liquid cable, with a hook or some other attachment to secure the line. The Pretormin Environ­ mental Basic kit also includes four quick-adhesion pitons that can securely attach to almost any surface. Models Include: Pretormin Environmental Basic Climbing Gear. MISCELLANEOUS SUNDRIES T here are plenty of pieces of gear that charac­ ters are likely to carry that are too mundane or inexpensive to track on their sheets. Chro- nos, writing implements, pocket knives, credit chips, street clothing, shoes, fancy hats, inex­ pensive jewelry and decorations, snacks, me­ mentos, holos of friends and family; all of these things and more are details that can embellish a character, but are not important enough to track. Player Characters can assume that they have any number of miscellaneous sundries on them, depending on what they feel their char­ acters would actually carry. DATAPAD Datapads are common on most technologically civi­ lized planets, and are used to record, store, display, and organize almost any kind of data from basic text to holographic recordings. Most come with a small display screen, though some use holoprojectors and are small enough to be easily carried in one or two hands, depending on the model. They are commonly encoded or encrypted so that only the actual owner can operate them; some are even set to wipe all data if unauthorized users attem pt access. Models Include: Numerous Variants. FUSION LANTERN These small, squat devices provide both light and heat for the surrounding area. They are also quite durable and reliable, and are commonly found in larger travel kits and survival packs. Characters can also plug other electronic devices into a fusion lantern to power them, such as datapads, glow rods, and small scanning devices. Models Include: SoroSuub Powermax Fusion Lantern. GLOW ROD A glow rod is a hand-held light source that illuminates an area in a directional beam. A common device with many different styles, each operates with an internal chemical power source or a small rechargeable power cell. Models Include: Numerous Variants. JET PACK A jet pack is ideal for fast maneuverability and surprise attacks. Most use small thrusters to blast into the air for short periods, though some augment this with anti- grav devices. Their only drawbacks are their large size and weight, limited fuel, and the not inconsiderable skill needed to pilot them safely. The Z-6 uses an air-breathing jet turbine to propel the user, maintaining stability via directional exhaust nozzles and a gyro-stabilizer. The pilot uses a verbal control interface and wrist controls to fly the jet pack. A jet pack allows a person to function as a Silhouette 1, Speed 2, Handling 0, System Strain Threshold 3 ve­ hicle that can only operate in atmosphere, and requires Piloting (Planetary) to operate. Models Include: Mitrinomon Z-6 Jet Pack. EXTRA RELOADS/POWER PACKS Technology runs on power, and while most devices have internal power sources, these either run out or need augmentation. Energy cells are small battery disks that can keep most hand-held devices going for a while lon­ ger, while power packs are larger versions suitable for blasters and other high-demand gear. Extra reloads al­ low characters to ignore an “out of ammo" ^ result with a ranged weapon. By spending a maneuver, they may reload their weapons and get back in the fight. Models Include: Numerous Variants. TOOL KIT In a technological galaxy, a tool kit is almost essential. Every vessel, no matter the size or function, has some sort of repair kit to deal with mechanical or electric fail­ ures, as calling for assistance is often not practical (or safe). Kits are also useful for repairing damaged droids or cybernetic parts, especially ones too modified to take to reputable mechanics. Tool kits need to have a wide range of gear, as many users are fond of tinkering and TABLE 5-8: GEAR AND EQUIPMENT upgrading on their own. Basic hammers, hydrospanner wrenches, restraining bolts, power coupling scrubbers, fusion cutters, laser and sonic welders, replacement wir­ ing and components, power calibrators, and of course welding goggles and heavy gloves are all standard components. Many of these also make for effective im­ provised weapons. For those used to doing extensive repairs, some kits include diagnostic probes and other aids to determine the nature of the fault. There is little a skilled mechanic cannot fix with a well-maintained and well-stocked toolkit, given adequate time to conduct the repairs (which is sometimes a problem too). Toolkits allow mechanics to perform most Mechan­ ics checks to repair mechanical devices, and can also be used to "heal" droids. Models Include: Numerous Variants. EMERGENCY REPAIR PATCH Emergency repair patches, like the SoroSuub Pocket Tech, are designed to be both portable and able to be used quickly in an emergency. An emergency re­ pair patch consists of a semi-flexible durasteel disk rimmed with auto-activating thermal welds. Some also contain an electrically inert inner insulation layer to protect against shortouts. The patch can be quickly applied over a damaged portion of a droid’s chassis, then almost instantly spot-welded into place, keeping the vulnerable interior safe from further damage and maintaining the chassis’s structural integrity. Emergency repair patches are one-use items that mechanics can use to patch small holes in items or ve­ hicles, or droids can use to heal wounds. The second use is more common. It takes a maneuver for a char­ acter to use an emergency repair patch on himself or Item Price Encum Rarity C om m unications Comlink (handheld) 25 0 0 Comlink (long range) 200 2 1 Holo-messenger 250 0 4 Poisons Synthetic Standard Neurotoxin (1 dose) (R) 50 0 6 Synthetic Standard Anesthetic (1 dose) 35 0 4 Synthetic Standard Neuroparalytic (1 dose) (R) 75 0 6 D e te ctio n Devices Electrobinoculars 250 1 1 General Purpose Scanner 5 0 0 2 3 Hand Scanner 100 0 2 Macrobinoculars 75 1 2 Scanner Goggles 150 0 3 Surveillance Tagger (R) 175 0 4 M e d ica l Bacta (liter) 20 1 1 Bacta (full tank) 4 ,0 0 0 12 1 Emergency Medpac 100 1 1 Medpac 400 2 2 Stimpack 25 0 1 Synthskin 10 1 C ybernetics Cybernetic Arm Mod V and VI 10,000 - 6 Cybernetic Brain Implant 10,000 - 6 Cybernetic Eyes 7 ,5 0 0 - 6 Cybernetic Leg M od II and III 10,000 - 6 Cybernetic Weapon 4 ,0 0 0 - j 7 CyberScanner Limb 4 ,0 0 0 7 Immune Implant 5 ,0 0 0 - 6 Im plant Arm or 7 ,5 0 0 - 6 Repli-Limb Prosthetic (limb) 2,000 4 Repli-Limb Prosthetic (organ) 1,000 4 R e cre a tio n a l/E n te rta in m e n t Chance Cubes 1 0 0 Dejarik Table 350 10 1 Sabacc Deck 40 0 0 S ecurity Binders 25 0 0 Comm Jam mer 4 0 0 4 3 Comm Scrambler 1,000 0 5 Disguise Kit too 2 4 Electronic Lock Breaker (R) 1,000 1 5 Restraining Bolt 35 0 0 Slicer Gear 5 0 0 2 4 another.

It takes a day for the droid's self repair diagnostics (or some ac­ tual repairs) to restore his body to enough functionality to be able to accept additional emergency patches. See page 220 for more information. Models Include: SoroSuub Pocket Tech. UTILITY BELT A utility belt is a common item for those on active missions where quick access to tools and gear is a ne­ cessity; even Imperial stormtroopers use them. Their contents will vary with their user and their planned ac­ tions; sabotage missions might have belts with explo­ sives and security slicer chips, while a ship mechanic might have his stuffed with his favorite tools. Some belts also have weapon holsters or clips. Utility belts increase the character’s encumbrance threshold by 1 . Models Include: Numerous Variants. BLACK MARKET ITEMS B lack markets exist across the galaxy, from the wretched hives of lawless frontier worlds to the hid­ den corners of Imperial fortresses. A smuggler might visit a black market to avoid Imperial or planetary tariffs on otherwise legal goods or to unload stolen items without the scrutiny of authorities, but he might also visit in search of contraband items unavailable at regulated ports. SPICE AND OTHER DRUGS Smugglers use “spice" as one common term to describe a variety of chemical concoctions as diverse and strange as the planets of the galaxy. Despite their different ori­ gins and specific effects, however, many examples of spice share two major qualities: a pleasurable tempo­ rary effect followed by negative side effects. Even vari­ ants of spice with medicinal or therapeutic qualities have the possibility of addiction. Many varieties of spice provide a simple high followed by a crash, but some drugs, such as the infamous glitterstim produced in the spice mines of Kessel, have more exotic and sometimes unpredictable effects when ingested. For these reasons, although many variants of spice are legal in the galaxy, even those types are heavily regulated on most worlds. Heavy regulation and illegality alike mean that spice is a popular item of contraband for smugglers across the galaxy. The Empire also enforces bans on many types of spice, but some Imperial soldiers, pilots, and scientists have been known to make use of performance enhancing substances (sometimes at the behest of their superiors and sometimes without their permission). Though run­ ning spice may be somewhat safer than trafficking weap­ owns, it is nonetheless a dangerous occupation for a smug­ gler. The criminal enterprises involved in the production and distribution of drugs such as spice are rarely known for their good nature or patience. Han Solo ran seriously afoul of Jabba the Hutt when he was forced to jettison a hold full of precious glitterstim that he was transporting for the crime lord. The fact that Imperial authorities were in the midst of boarding the Millennium Falcon when Han abandoned his cargo did little to soften Jabba’s heart, and Han’s arguably reasonable choice still ended up earning him a death mark. AVABUSH SPICE Avabush spice is a drug that induces relaxation and lethargy, and some use it as an illicit sleep aid. Unlike many varieties of spice, it has no hallucinogenic quali­ ties and does not cause physical addiction in most species. However, it does have one interesting quirk that separates it from countless similar drugs: avabush spice makes users more truthful, and can be used to extract information when combined with targeted and insistent questioning. Though not particularly valuable, avabush can only be found on the planet of Baros and in certain specialized greenhouses that maintain sam­ ples. It is considerably less effective than the various truth serums commonly employed by the Empire, but is also harder to detect and less unpleasant for those consuming it. A character who has consumed avabush spice feels lethargic, and can only upgrade a single <0 to a O on any given check because of this mental torpor. Further, whenever this character intentionally tries to lie or conceal the truth, the GM upgrades any one ^ in the dice pool into a # . Avabush spice’s effects last for one scene or combat encounter. Restrictions: Avabush spice is banned or controlled on most worlds with a strong Imperial presence. BOOSTER BLUE Derived from an industrial dye used in large-scale con­ struction operations such as the creation of starships, booster blue is a performance enhancing drug popular amongst pilots and gunmen. The drug is most often dis­ tributed as a blue liquid stored in metal cans to prevent spillage on skin or surfaces that are easily damaged. Though nobody seems to know the drug’s exact history, apparently some intrepid soul came to the realization that by consuming this chemical concoction meant for painting starships, humans and many other species can temporarily benefit from drastically boosted reaction times. Of course, this power is not without a p ric e - booster blue has a number of deleterious side-effects, and over-doses are common, especially amongst pilots who attempt to overlap applications of the drug during extended combat operations. A character under the effects of booster blue may up­ grade the ability of any Agility, Intellect, or Cunning-re­ lated check he undertakes once, reflecting his improved concentration and mental acuity. However, this artificial focus takes a toll on the mind. A character under the ef­ fects of booster blue may not remove strain at the end of any scenes or encounters for the remainder of the session. Booster blue’s beneficial effects last for one scene or combat encounter. Restrictions: Booster blue is illegal on most worlds. GLITTERSTIM Glitterstim is a vanishingly rare variety of spice, re­ fined from the webs spun by the energy spiders of Kessel and mined by the unfortunate slaves sent into those pitch-black depths. Because of its pho­ toactive qualities, it cannot be exposed to light at any stage before consumption, and so laborers at various stages carefully move it from the darkness of the caverns to special holding containers, and then to the small, opaque packets in which it is sold. Its production is jealously guarded by the Em­ pire, and thus a hold full of glitterstim is a treasure for any smuggler ambitious enough to try to sell it. The value of glitterstim comes as much from the uniqueness of its properties as its rarity. While it cer­ tainly provides a powerful high and is as addictive as many of its equivalents, rumors whisper that it has an­ other, much more interesting effect when consumed. Glitterstim is said to provide those who ingest it with limited telepathic abilities. Of course, there are those who claim that this so-called telepathy is merely a drug-induced delusion, but many swear by the intuitive abilities that each dose imparts. Unfortunately, along with these supposed powers comes another certain effect—glitterstim slowly but surely erodes the mind, burning away certain nerves in the brain connected to sight and coordination, as well as mental balance. Glitterstim is a highly addictive drug with halluci­ nogenic properties. Using it adds three □ to all Per­ ception and Vigilance checks for the remainder of a scene. Additionally, some users report gaining tempo­ rary telepathic abilities, which the GM may choose to grant to any user at his discretion. Restrictions: Glitterstim is illegal on most worlds, and its trade is aggressively monitored and controlled by Im­ perial authorities. LESAI Lesai is a variety of spice that is not mined, but grown in a fungus found only on certain kinds of lizards from the planets Zebitrope IV and VIII. By harvesting the distinctive purple mold and applying it underneath the jaw, members of many sentient species can elimi­ nate their need to sleep.

Most species become psycho­ logically if not physically dependent on the drug very quickly, however, and users who miss a dose frequent­ ly collapse and only awake days later. A character who partakes in lesai at least once every twenty-four hours does not need to sleep, and suffers no penalties or strain for lack of sleep. The character may re­ move strain as if he had slept a full night after any period of eight or more hours in which he did not engage in any stressful activities (such as combat, intense mental effort, or emotionally charged discussion). Lesai’s only notice­ able side-effect is that it leaves odd purple stains where applied. If a character under the effects of lesai ever goes twenty-four full hours without a dose of the drug, he finds it increasingly difficult to stay awake until he receives more lesai or sleeps. Some Imperial officials claim that lesai turns users into amoral monsters without feelings or com­ passion. Whether this is true or not is entirely up to the GM, and he should feel free to keep his decision secret from any players whose characters use lesai. Restrictions: Lesai is illegal on most worlds with a strong Imperial presence. YARROCK For untold ages, the spice called yarrock has been pro­ duced on Iridonia, created by their shamans to grant their warriors a greater clarity of mind and violent purpose. Though there are other drugs that fit this de­ scription scattered across the galaxy, many seasoned warriors respond with respect, adulation, or even fear to the mere sight of the signature black pellets that contain yarrock. A soldier under the effects of yarrock is ruthless, and able to shrug off tremendous physical hardship. Unfortunately, for every high there is a crash, and this drug is no exception—as a dose runs its course, its effect seems to reverse, and every step becomes an endless journey until the warrior can metabolize the chemicals or simply collapses from exhaustion. Some also say that the drug has a further effect on the user’s very soul, drawing it deeper and deeper into the shad­ ows as time goes on, but validated scientific data on this particular concern is understandably scarce. Yarrock lasts for one scene. A character under the effects of yarrock is not required to make any Fear checks; he counts as succeeding automatically. How­ ever, once he has used yarrock, he must also add ■ to any Willpower or Presence-related checks for the remainder of the session. Restrictions: Yarrock is quite rare, and thus few plan­ ets explicitly regulate its use, as the only shipments go through black market traders. DEATH STICKS Death sticks are an unpleasant creation derived from the balo mushroom of the planet of Balosar and dis­ tributed in a liquid form in distinctive small red and yellow rods. Though the drug is only mildly hallucino­ genic, death sticks are well-named; the active ingredi­ ent, Ixetal Cilona, is highly addictive and deleterious to one’s health. Each dose tears away an ever-greater portion of one’s life while simultaneously tightening the grip of addiction. Death sticks are illegal for obvi­ ous reasons, and more than a few smug­ glers who hap­ pily deal in spice or illicit arms avoid running shipments of this particular drug on what they term “moral grounds.” Use of death sticks also weakens a person’s connec­ tion to the Force temporarily, though few users or even dealers are aware of this fact. Death sticks have a nasty result in the long run, but unless one’s campaign runs over the course of decades or a character has had a death stick ad­ diction for some years already, characters are un­ likely to experience the truly miserable death these drugs bring about. A life-long addiction to death sticks typically halves the lifespan of most species, though various species are more or less susceptible to the effects of Ixetal Cilona. The short-term ef­ fects of a single dose last for one scene or combat encounter and adds ■ to any task the character a t­ tempts, and may reduce the character’s connection to the Force in certain ways at the CM’s discretion. Restrictions: Death sticks are controlled substances on most worlds, and at the very least those under the age of majority cannot purchase them. Death sticks are completely illegal on many other worlds, especially those with high health standards. UNIQUE ILLEGAL EQUIPMENT Certain pieces of technology are too powerful, too dangerous, or too subversive for the ruling authorities to allow civilians to use them. For instance, high-pow­ ered military-grade weapons are contraband on most worlds where public firefights are seen as a crime and not a form of entertainment. On most planets, one would need to search a black market to find most of the items listed below. OUTLAW TECH DATA BREAKER Data breakers are basic tools of the trade for many slicers. While droid slicers are programmed to crack complex sequences, organics usually lack this innate option, and therefore rely on a data breaker to do the grunt work of opening systems to them so that their true skills can shine once they are inside. Most data breakers are also recording devices, and can pull vast amounts of information from ill-guarded systems in sec­ onds. Droid slicers can choose to have a data breaker (or equivalent systems) installed internally at the same cost. Data breakers add □ □ to any Computers check made to slice computers (as opposed to the usual one for having the right tools for the job). Restrictions: The Empire and many planetary govern­ ments restrict possession of data-breaking technology. Military and law-enforcement organizations make legal use of these devices, but typically civilian use of such technology is prohibited.

The disguise is good enough that any checks made to ascertain the user’s true identity have their difficulty set at Formidable ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ > Restrictions: Many elements within the kit are perfect­ ly legal on their own, but most planetary and Imperial authorities take a dim view of anyone actually carrying a set of items that allows the user to mask himself down to a genetic level. OUTLAW TECH PERSONAL STEALTH FIELD Personal stealth fields, as the name suggests, are min­ iaturized stealth fields that allow their user to vanish from the sight of organic creatures and droids without sufficiently acute optics. Most of them are relics of an age long-past, though several contemporary efforts have been made by various military organizations to recreate this technology. While they are undeniably effective for those who wish to pass unnoticed, the major flaw of most per­ sonalized stealth fields is that they are prone to col­ lapsing. Scientists have theorized that this may be an unavoidable result of miniaturizing technology meant for starships, a design flaw, or a result of many of the active devices being antiques. In any case, few are lucky enough to possess one of these devices, and their infamous unreliability makes many prospective users wary. When using this device, it is impossible to see the user visually. In addition, any checks to ascer­ tain the user’s location by other means (such as hear­ ing, smell, or observing the surrounding environment) have their difficulty set at Formidable ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Restrictions: Personalized stealth fields are vanish­ ingly rare, and so few governments bother to place re­ strictions on their use. Some are legitimate artifacts of ages past, while others are stolen military technology, and the particulars of their creation dictate their legal­ ity. Of course, law enforcement officers tend not to see these fine distinctions when apprehending people using them to commit crimes. CUSTOMIZATION AND MODIFICATIONS E quipment and weapons in the Star Wars galaxy are made in every conceivable way. Some are hand­ crafted, like the custom bowcasters of the Wookiee homeworld, Kashyyyk. Others might be stamped out of an assembly line on an industrial world like Corus- cant. Even the latter may have a drastically different look from similar products made on other worlds. The holdout blaster carried by Han Solo looks nothing like the one carried by Lando Calrissian. The statistics and rules for gear in E dge of the Em pir e are framed in fa irly general categories to present clear, simple, and unified rules for their use, but the look of your character’s gear can be tailored both cosm etically (meaning it has no game effect) and m echanically (which changes its basic rules or statistics). In general, players can purchase attachments to customize their gear. Attachments are physical items that attach to or are installed in items, vehicles, and weapons to add capabilities or improve performance. Attachments have a set of base modifiers that they automatically grant when installed. Installing an at­ tachment is a fairly simple process (as they are de­ signed for easy installation) and simply requires a few minutes of uninterrupted work. Attachments slot into the hard points listed in a piece of equipment's stat block. Each attachment gives the ship, vehicle, or weapon some sort of bonus or edge (an extra point or two of speed for a hot-rod ship engine, or more soak for a suit of armor, for in­ stance). In most cases, that’s as far as it goes. The player spends his money for his new attachment and he is left with an improved and unique piece of equip­ meant specifically tailored to his needs. However, if the player wishes to further customize and personalize a piece of equipment, he uses the mod system. MODDING ATTACHMENTS Most attachments have a listed series of mods These are additional modifications that a skilled mechanic can make to the attachment to further improve the weapon or item’s performance. These are listed under each attachment’s modification options All of these modification options are potential mods for gear. Some of the modification options have a number listed before them, indicating that the op­ tion can be installed multiple times. Otherwise, each option can only be installed once. Modifications represent dedicated mechanics’ and gearheads’ ability to tweak and customize their gear. They are potential customizations available to those skilled with devices and gear. Of course, even the most talented mechanic can only do so much with a particular piece of tech, which is why each attach­ meant has a discrete list of modification options. INSTALLING MODS To install a mod, the user selects one uninstalled mod­ ification option. He then spends 100 credits on com­ ponents and supplies, makes sure he has a toolkit, spends a couple hours at a work bench, and makes a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Mechanics check If he succeeds, he successfully installs the mod on his gear, and the item now benefits from the bonus provided by the mod. If he fails, however, the mod is not installed, and he may not attempt to install that mod again. If he failed and his check generated at least one the attachment is also rendered useless by his tinkering. Each additional mod installed in an attachment be­ yond the first increases the difficulty of the Mechan­ ics check by one, and costs an additional 100 credits beyond the base cost. TYPES OF MODS There are several types of mods, each falling into one of the following broad categories. • Damage mods: This mod increases the damage dealt by the weapon. • Weapon quality mods: This mod adds a listed quality to the weapon. Some qualities have values that can increase; if this is the case, then the mod lists it as “Quality (+1)” indicating that it can in­ crease an existing quality if it is already present or adds the quality at rating 1 if it’s not there. • Innate talent mods: This mod grants the user the listed talent only when wielding this gear and only affecting this gear. For example, if a blast­ er had the Innate Talent (Quick Draw), the user would be able to use Quick Draw to draw or stow his blaster, but none of his other gear. • Skill and characteristic bonuses: This mod grants the user a bonus in the listed skill or char­ acteristic as if he had + 1 rank in that skill or char­ acteristic when using the modded item. • Additional mod: Some mods may not fall into any of the listed categories. If a mod does something specific and unique, it is described in the entry. WEAPON ATTACHMENTS T he longer the average fringer lives with a weapon, the more likely it is that he will modify it in some way to increase its performance or otherwise better suit his tastes and needs. The following is a selection of common attachments and modifications that can be installed on personal weapons. Due to the very personal nature of customization, it is nearly impos­ sible to catalog every possible modification a fringer could make to his equipment, and the following list, while detailed, is far from comprehensive. It should be noted that, even with taking a weap­ on's customization hard points into account, there is limited space on even the largest weapon, and only a few spots where attachments can be mounted. For ex­ ample, under-barrel attachments such as bipods and auxiliary weapons can only be mounted to long arms like blaster rifles or slugthrower rifles. In addition, us­ ing under-barrel attachments as an example, rifle-sized weapons can only mount one under-barrel attachment due to space limitations. Players and Game Masters should use common sense when choosing attachments, and are advised to pay close attention to the attach­ meant descriptions that note where attachments can be mounted and what weapons they can be mounted to. AUGMENTED SPIN BARREL Using an updated and streamlined galven pattern and heavy-duty static pulse adaptors, this custom barrel in­ creases both the damage output and armor penetration of blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles. The trade-off for all this extra stopping power is increased wear and tear on both the frame of the blaster and the barrel, leading to an increase in maintenance and down-time. This attachment can only be used with blaster rifles and heavy blaster rifles. Models Include: Dolmax 243X "Penetrator" Aug­ mented Spin Barrel, Arakyd HH780 HotShot Barrel, BlasTech Model 213 Perforator Barrel. Base Modifiers: Increase weapon damage by one point. Adds ■ to all Mechanics checks when perform­ ing maintenance on this weapon. Modification Options: 2 Damage +1 Mods, 1 Weapon Quality (Accurate + I) Mod, 1 Weapon Qual­ ity (Pierce +1) Mod. Hard Points Required: 2 Price: 1,750 credits. BALANCED HILT Balance is key in a well-constructed melee weapon. Pro­ fessional weaponsmiths can use modern ultra-light mate­ rials to create a sword or axe that is not only lighter, but also more accurate in the hands of a skilled warrior. This attachment can be used with any melee weapon. Models Include: None Base Modifiers: Grants the weapon the Accurate (+1) Quality. Modification Options: I Weapon Quality (Accurate + 1) Mod, 1 Decrease encumbrance of weapon by one to a minimum of one Mod. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 1,500 credits. BLASTER ACTUATING MODULE A Blaster Actuating Module is a blaster modification pop­ ular with mercenaries, bounty hunters, and anyone need­ ing to make the first strike count. Adaptable to nearly any blaster pistol, this attachment is a simple upgraded blast­ er actuating module with custom firmware and a stronger electromagnetic accelerator that provides more powerful and more penetrating blaster shots. Unfortunately, this excess power takes its toll on the weapon, and blasters so modified tend to develop reliability problems the longer they are used with this attachment. This attachment is only for use on Ranged (Light) blaster pistols. Models Include: SoroSuub X440 ‘‘Hammer” Blaster Actuating Module, Dolmax Heavy Blaster Actuator, Arakyd 97R Enhanced Blaster Actuating Module. Base Modifiers: Increase weapon damage by one point. Adds ■ to all Ranged (Light) checks when using this weapon. Modification Options: 2 Damage +1 Mods, 2 Weapon Quality (Pierce + 1) Mods. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 500 credits. BIPOD MOUNT Little more than a pair of folding or collapsible legs m ounted beneath the barrel of a long arm, bipods are used to stabilize awkward or heavy weapons to improve their firing characteristics. Especially useful when firing from behind low cover or from a prone position, bipods are typically used on squad support weapons, or by sharpshooters and snipers to b etter steady their weapons. This attachment can only be applied to rifles, carbines, and light repeating blasters, and takes one preparation ma­ neuver to set up. Models Include: Galactic Arms XA Classic Bipod, Czerka AA20 Marksman Bipod. Base Modifiers: Decrease weapon’s Cumbersome rating by 2 when firing from a prone or crouched posi­ tion (or can otherwise brace the bipod on something). Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: 100 credits.

Bowcasters require an incredible level of raw physical strength to wield, espe­ cially when loading and cocking the weapon to fire. A time-consuming and labor-intensive process, reload­ ing a bowcaster is made much simpler and easier by use of the automatic re-cocker. This attachment entails upgrading the basic weapon with a number of power- assist systems as well as a magazine feed system that allows the weapon to fire, re-cock, and reload all in one smooth, quick movement. These attachments are only for use on Wookiee bowcasters, and they cannot be pur­ chased; they must be built either by the owner of the bowcaster with an Average Mechanics check or the weaponsmith who built the weapon for him. Models Include: None. Base Modifiers: Removes reloading maneuver re­ quirement from bowcaster. Modification Options: 1 Weapon Quality (Auto­ fire) Mod. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: Not available for sale, parts cost 500 credits. BOWCASTER ACCELERATOR ENHANCEMENT Built from scavenged blaster parts and the occa­ sional piece from a repulsorlift generator, the bow­ caster accelerator enhancement is the second-most common modification to Wookiee bowcasters after the automatic re-cocker. Essentially an upgrade of the weapon’s bolt accelerators, this attachment al­ checks with this weapon while engaged to an addi­ tional t (rather than Modification Options: 1 Innate Talent (Point Blank Rank + 1) Mod, 1 Weapon Quality (Accurate + 1) Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 250 credits. MARKSMAN BARREL Merr-Sonn's KX765 Marksman Barrel was designed to meet the needs of the fringer for whom long-range ac­ curacy is a necessity. Popular among bounty hunters and assassins, this barrel is nearly two meters long and made of lightweight materials. It features upgraded static pulse adaptors as well as a denser galven circuitry pattern that not only increases the weapon’s range, but also its accu­ racy. The trade-off for this increased range and accuracy is a weapon that’s slightly awkward to use and nearly im­ possible to conceal due to the length of the barrel. This modification may only be applied to blaster rifles. Models Include: Merr-Sonn KX756 Marksman Barrel, SoroSuub WQ80 ’’Long-shot’’ Barrel, Arakyd 5300 Hawkeye Sharpshooter’s Barrel. Base Modifiers: Increases weapon’s Range by one Range Band, the weapon gains the Cumbersome 2 Quality. Modification Options: 2 Weapon Quality (Accurate + 1) Mods, i Innate Talent (Sniper Shot) Mod. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 1,200 credits. MONO-MOLECULAR EDGE Even vibroweapons can benefit from an edge sharp­ need to molecular thickness and toughened through laser-forging techniques. This modification may be applied to melee weapons that use a cutting edge. lows the bowcaster to fire its highly destructive quar­ rels with more force than typical in a stock weapon. These attachments are only for use on Wookiee bow- casters, and they cannot be purchased; they must be built either by the owner of the bowcaster with an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Mechanics check or the weapon- smith who built the weapon for him. Models Include: None. Base Modifiers: Increase weapon damage by one point. M odification Options: 2 Damage + 1 Mods, 2 Weapon Q u ality (Pierce + 1) Mods. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: Not available for sale, parts cost 250 credits. FILED FRONT SIGHT An old assassin’s trick, this is the simple act of remov­ ing the front sight of a blaster pistol by filing it off. A common modification to holdout blasters (along with removing their serial numbers), filing down the weap­ on’s front sight allows it to be drawn more quickly from its holster, and reduces the possibility of it be­ coming snared on clothing. Unfortunately, while this modification makes for easy concealment and draw­ ing, it also reduces the weapon’s accuracy, as it ef­ fectively makes it impossible to aim with any amount of precision. This modification may only be applied to pistol-sized weapons. Applying it oneself requires an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Mechanics check; the cost is paying others to perform the modification. Other Models Include: None. Base Modifiers: Innate Talent (Quick Draw), Increase­ es difficulty of combat checks to hit targets at ranges beyond short range by one. Modification Options: 1 Decreases the difficulty of checks to conceal the weapon by one Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 25 credits. FOREARM GRIP Little more than a vertical handgrip affixed below the bar­ rel of a rifle-sized weapon, forearm grips are a popular modification among mercenaries, designed to give the user better control over the weapon. This Attachment can only be used on rifles (but not heavy rifles) and carbines. Other Models Include: Galactic Arms Model 9 Forearm Grip, Dolmax 1 4A Detachable Pistol Grip, Merr-Sonn AG44S Ergonomic Tactical Foregrip. Base Modifiers: Decreases the additional difficulty of making Ranged (Heavy) Models Include: None listed. Base Modifiers: Decrease the weapon’s Crit Rating by 1 to a minimum of 1. M odification Options: 2 Weapon Q uality (Pierce + 1) Mods. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: 1,000 credits. MULTI-OPTIC SIGHT A complex and sophisticated piece of equipment, the multi-optic sight is a wonder of modern sensor technol­ ogy. Marketed to the discriminating professional soldier, each consists of a bulky on-weapon optic equipped with numerous sensors including low-light, thermal, ul­ trasound, millimeter wave emitters, video capture, and common optical enhancements. The optic is connected to a pair of goggles worn by the user by a reinforced fiber optic cable that transmits the vision enhancements directly to the user in real time. This allows the user to see around corners and over obstacles. This attachment can be fit to any ranged weapon. Models Include: Galactic Arms Model 44 Combat Optical Enhancer, SoroSuub XAD Omnisight, Merr- Sonn 480.zl "Beholder” Multi-Optic Sight. Base Modifiers: Removes up to ■ ■ on any checks to use this weapon due to smoke, darkness, or other environmental conditions that obstruct vision. Modification Options: 2 Skill (Perception) Mods. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 2,000 credits. SPREAD BARREL Commonly applied to blaster rifles and carbines, BlasTech's "Scattergun" Spread Barrel is a common modification among spacers and fringers. Designed with close-quarters combat in mind, this attachment replaces a blaster's stock barrel with one shorter, bulkier, broader, and equipped with a built-in flash hider. Using a stepped array of prismatic crystals lo­ cated at the end of the barrel as well as a reconfigured galven pattern, this barrel splits the blaster’s beam into a number of smaller beams that exit the barrel in a spray pattern. Used in a tightly packed space, these beams can strike multiple targets with one pull of the trigger. The trade-off for this, however, is a reduction in the weapon’s range. This attachment can only be applied to blaster rifles and blaster carbines. Models Include: BlasTech 8405 "Scattergun” Spread Barrel, SoroSuub 800 "Blunderbuss” barrel, Arakyd Model 70 "Chain Lightning” Spread Barrel. Base Modifiers: Grants Weapon Quality Blast (4), Reduces weapon’s range by one range band to a mini­ mum of engaged. Modification Options: 2 Blast + 1 Mods. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 1,725 credits. SERRATED EDGE The simplicity of this modification belies its vicious­ ness. Adding a serrated edge to a weapon is some­ thing almost anyone can do, and giving a bladed weapon tearing edges ensures it does terrible dam­ age to flesh and bone. This modification may be ap­ plied to melee weapons that use a cutting edge. Models Include: None. Base Modifiers: Grants the weapon the Vicious ( + 1) Quality. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 50 credits. SUPERIOR WEAPON CUSTOMIZATION Even the simplest weapon can benefit from a crafts­ man’s touch. A skilled weaponsmith can tweak a weap­ on to its owner’s exacting specifications, turning a blunt instrument into a honed and deadly weapon of war. Models Include: None. Base Modifiers: Grants the weapon the Superior Quality. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 5,000 credits. SHORTENED BARREL Shortened barrels are a handy modification used by spies, plain-clothes law enforcement officers, and any­ one needing to conceal the fact that they are carry­ ing a weapon. Little more than a replacement barrel shorter than the standard one, this attachment makes concealing a pistol easier, and can improve the speed of a quick draw. This attachment can only be applied to Ranged (Light) pistol weapons. Models Include: Arakyd SB4 “Stubber”, SoroSuub SBSS Reduced Length Barrel. Base Modifiers: Reduces the difficulty of checks made to conceal this weapon by one. Reduces range by one range band to a minimum of short. If already short, add ■ to attack checks. Modification Options: 1 Innate Talent (Quick Draw) Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 250 credits. UNDER-BARREL GRENADE LAUNCHER Under-barrel grenade launchers are designed to give soldiers or squads heavy anti-infantry or light anti-ve­ hicle capabilities in a small package. This attachment consists of a basic, smooth-bore barrel attached to a magazine with an automatic feed system. It carries up to six grenades and is fired by a simple press of a but­ ton. It adds extra weight to the weapon it’s mounted to, however, which makes the entire assembly quite barrel heavy. This attachment can only be applied to rifle-sized weapons (Ranged (Heavy) weapons). Models Include: Czerka "Thumper" Under-barrel Grenade Launcher, SoroSuub XA203 Auxiliary Gre­ nade Launcher, Zone Control “Viper" Under-Barrel Grenade Launcher. Base Modifiers: Enables weapon to fire grenades. This uses the grenade’s profile, but uses the Ranged (Heavy) skill to fire and has Medium range. Adds Cum­ bersome ( + 1) to weapon, and increase encumbrance by 2. Remember, grenades are Limited Ammo 1 weap­ owns and the launcher is thus Limited Ammo 1. M odification Options: 5 Q uality (Limited Ammo + 1) Mods. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: (R) 2,000 credits. UNDER-BARREL FLAME PROJECTOR Uncommon but highly effective, the Firestorm by Czerka is a small, under-barrel flame projector de­ signed to give an infantryman extra punch at short range. Illegal on many worlds and classified as a ter­ ror weapon, these weapons are typically used by only the most desperate or callous individuals. This attach­ meant can only be applied to rifle-sized weapons. Models Include: Czerka “ Firestorm" Under-barrel Flame Projector, Merr-Sonn XR1 4 Sunsear Flame Pro­ jector, SoroSuub “Inferno" Auxiliary Flamer. Base Modifiers: Enables weapon to fire using the following profile at the user’s choice: (Heavy Ranged; Dam 10; Crit 2; Range [Short]; Burn 5, Blast 2). Adds Cumbersome ( + 1) to weapon. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: (R) 3,000 credits. TELESCOPIC OPTICAL SIGHT Popular with marksmen and snipers, this attachment con­ sists of a long tube attached to the top of a weapon with a number of precisely ground lens elements protected by an impact-resistant housing. The resulting scope magnifies distant images for long-range shooting. This attachment can be used on any ranged weapon (with the exception of one-use weapons like grenades, or weapons like flame projectors that would not realistically benefit from a sight). Models Include: Merr-Sonn 80Z Telescopic Optical Sight, Zikon Optics Model 40 Marksman Scope. Base Modifiers: Reduce the difficulty of ranged combat checks at long and extreme range by one. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: 250 Credits. TRIPOD MOUNT Designed for use with the heaviest man-portable weap­ owns, tripods are a common sight among heavy weapon squads. Used in static weapon emplacements to sup­ port heavy squad support weapons such as the Impe­ rial Army's E-Web heavy repeating blaster, tripods use a number of different technologies—from self-extending hydraulics to tiny, low-output repulsorlift generators—to stabilize heavy weapons for firing. This attachment is only for use on light repeating blasters and heavy repeating blasters, as well as any portable Gunnery weapons. Set­ ting up a tripod takes two preparation maneuvers. M odels Include: BlasTech 5R Heavy Weapon Tri­ pod M ount. Base Modifiers: Decrease weapon’s Cumbersome rating by 3 when set up. May not move the weapon (except to pivot) once tripod is set up. M odification Options: 2 Weapon Q uality (Cum­ bersome -1 ) Mods. Hard Points Required: 2 Price: 250 credits. WEAPON SLING Slings are lengths of hide or synthetic fabric designed to allow easy handling of long arms like blaster rifles and slugthrower rifles. They come in a dizzying array of styles, from the simple adjustable single-strap sling for carrying a weapon off the shoulder to multi-strap slings made of specialized materials that allow for any num­ ber of custom sling configurations. These attachments can only be used with Ranged (Heavy) weapons. Models Include: Custom-tooled Bantha hide sling, Tactical three-point sling, Quick-release one-point drop sling. Base Modifiers: Decrease Cumbersome rating by 1. Modification Options: I Innate Talent (Quick Draw) Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 100 credits. WEAPON HARNESS Designed to allow a single sentient to field even the heaviest man-portable weapons with no support, weapon harnesses are rare among the Outer Rim ter­ ritories. Worn over the shoulders and belted around the midsection or torso, weapon harnesses consist of a series of load-bearing straps and harnesses con­ nected to a gyro-stabilized, power-assisted boom arm attached to a heavy weapon. Powered by a tiny rechargeable power pack, the harness offers its user enhanced stability and strength when using heavy weapons. This attachment can only be used with Ranged (Heavy) and Gunnery weapons. Models Include: Arakyd WW480 “Goliath" Weapon Harness, Galactic Arms HR 12 Power Harness, Soro- Suub “Little Giant” Heavy Weapon Power Assist. Base Modifiers: Decrease Cumbersome rating by 2. Modification Options: 1 Innate Talent (Brace) Mod. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 500 credits. WEIGHTED HEAD Weapons designed to bludgeon foes to unconscious­ ness or death often benefit from extra weight added to the striking surface. This can be accomplished through using heavier materials in the construction, or just by adding metal bands or studs to the business end. Re­ enforced “knuckles" can be added to some brawling weapons for similar effect. This attachment can only be added to bludgeoning Melee or Brawl weapons. Models Include: None. Base Modifiers: Damage + 1 Modification Options: 1 Damage+1 Mod, 1 Weapon quality (Concussive + 1) Mod. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 250 credits. ARMOR ATTACHMENTS Armor, like personal weapons, has a number of custom­ ization hard points and can be just as easily modified as a blaster or slugthrower. By design, armor attachments are more defensive in nature, leaning towards special coat­ ings or environmental sealants, as well as enhanced op­ tics and built-in communications. As with weapons, a fair amount of common sense on the part of the players and Game Master is required when modifying armor. Most suits of armor can only hold one environmental system, such as cold or heat resistance, or one type of optical en­ hancement in the helmet. CORTOSIS WEAVE Although uncommon and even considered archaic in this day and age, some armorers specially equip pro­ tective gear with an underlying weave of rare cortosis. This does tend to make the armor more resistant to being penetrated (especially by energy weapons), but the cost is seldom worth the result. Models Include: Numerous variants. Base Modifiers: The armor gains the Cortosis quality. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 10,000 credits. THERMAL SHIELDING SYSTEM Utilizing both active and passive cooling systems, along with an insulated body glove and special coatings on the armor plates, this attachment allows a wearer to withstand dangerously high temperatures. This ther­ mal shielding is proof against open flames, molten rock and steel, intense heat, and even some forms of radia­ tion. This attachment can be installed on any armor that covers the entire body and can be sealed. Models Include: Atlas Corp Model 451 Heat Exchanger, Min-Dal 5100 Firebrand Suit, Kaminoan Armorsmiths Thermal Shielding System. Base Modifiers: Reduces the difficulty of Resilience checks made to resist the effects of fire and extreme heat by one. Removes up to ■ ■ added to checks due to extreme heat or fire. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: 1,000 credits. HEATING SYSTEM Like thermal shielding, cold shielding is installed in armor to protect the wearer against dangerously low temperatures and frigid environments. Equipped with small, efficient heating elements and double- insulated against the cold, this attachment allows a wearer to survive in places where the ambient tem ­ perature can be dozens of degrees below freezing. Perhaps the most famous type of cold shielding is that built into the custom laminate armor worn by the Imperial Arm y’s snowtroopers. This attachment can be installed on any armor that covers the entire body and can be sealed. Models Include: Atlas Corp DL87 “ Frostback" Armor Enhancement, Min-Dal Model 00 Heating System. Base Modifiers: Reduces the difficulty of Resilience checks made to resist the effects of extreme cold by one. Removes up to ■ ■ added to checks due to extreme cold. Modification Options: None Hard Points Required: 1, Price: 1,000 credits. ENHANCED OPTICS SUITE Built into a helmet, this system provides an individual with a host of specialized optical and audio sensors. Each system is equipped with passive light amplifica­ tion, thermal signature readers, ultrasound pickups, mil­ limeter wave emitters, video capture, and common opti­ cal enhancements. This may be installed on any armor. Other Models Include: BioTech MULTI Enhanced Vision System, Atlas Corp Full-Spectrum Optical En­ hancer, Neuro-Saav Anq-Y Enhanced Optics Suite Base Modifiers: Removes up to ■ ■ added to all Perception, Surveillance, Vigilance, and combat skill checks due to darkness, smoke, or other environmen­ tal effects that obscure vision. Modification Options: 1 Skill (Vigilance) Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 1,750 credits. STRENGTH ENHANCING SYSTEM Strength enhancing systems easily converts a suit of full armor into a power-assisted suit. Composed of a matrix of electrically controlled myomer synthetic muscle fibers backed up with nano-hydraulics, the MSES increases a wearer’s raw physical strength, al­ lowing him to lift more and carry more for longer pe­ riods of time. This attachment can only be used with laminate armor or similar full-body hard armor suits. Models Include: Industrial Automaton Xr5 Power As­ sist, BioTech “ Brute” Strength Enhancer, Atlas Corp Myomer Strength Enhancing System. Base Modifiers: Increases wearer’s Brawn by one point while wearing this armor. This does not increase soak or wound threshold. Modification Options: 2 Skill (Athletics) Mods, 2 In­ nate Talent (Brace) Mods. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 5,500 credits. VACUUM SEALED Full body armor can be designed to be sealed against a vacuum, allowing the user to operate in space. This modi­ fication provides the armor with enough air and insula­ tion to survive for up to 10 minutes, and obviously also protects against adverse atmospheric environments. This can only be applied to laminate or battle armor. Models Include: Numerous Variants. Base Modifiers: Allows the user to ignore the effects of vacuum or poisonous atmospheric environments for up to 10 minutes. Modification Options: None Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 1,000 credits. OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE SYSTEM Popular with both military scouts and assassins, optical camouflage systems are a wonder of modern stealth technology. Using a series of phased array optical pro­ jectors combined with sound baffling equipment and thermal and radiation shielding, Merr-Sonn's “Ghost” OCS can render a wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye. The PAO projectors allow the wearer to blend in with his surroundings by mimicking them, similar to an animal with active camouflage abilities, and the different radia­ tion shields hide the wearer’s body heat as well as any electromagnetic radiation from other sensors or commu­ nications gear. For all of its utility, however, this system is incredibly fragile and is not recommended for combat. This attachment can be equipped on any type of armor, but is nearly useless on laminate and plastoid heavy ar­ more, which is often too bulky and loud to mask properly. Models Include: BioTech “ Flicker" Displacement Field, Atlas Corp "Smokescreen” Stealth System, Merr-Sonn “Ghost” Optical Camouflage System. Base Modifiers: Upgrades the ability of all Stealth checks twice while wearing this armor. Modification Options: Innate Talent (Master of Shadows) Mod, 1 Skill (Stealth) Mod. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 5,500 credits. SUPERIOR ARMOR CUSTOMIZATION Any piece of armor can benefit from retooling at the hands of a superior craftsman. A skilled armorsmith can add improved plastoid or even durasteel plat­ ing to increase the protection a piece of armor offers even as he decreases its weight and bulk. Of course, such delicate and exacting work can make the armor less customizable in other respects. Models Include: Numerous Variants. Base Modifiers: Gives the armor the Superior Quality. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: 5,000 credits. CONFLICT AND COMBAT “ O h h h , g r e a t w a r r io r . W a rs n o t m a k e o n e g r e a t . " -M aster Yoda T he galaxy is a dangerous place. War between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance overwhelms many portions of the galaxy. Crime lords, pirates, mer­ cenaries, and brigands thrive in the dark and lawless reaches, preying on the weak and each other alike. Shady deals, clandestine meetings, and struggles for power, however small, are just day-to-day business in the fringes of society. In other words, the galaxy is ripe for adventure. NARRATIVE AND STRUCTURED GAMEPLAY M ost of the gameplay in Edge of the Empire is done on a narrative basis, with the GM describing events and the players describing their characters’ ac­ tions and reactions to these events. Combat, however, requires more structured gameplay. Narrative gameplay does not require the GM or play­ ers to keep track of the exact passage of time, and for the most part, this is perfectly acceptable It's usually enough to know that actions may Lake a few minutes, hours, days, or weeks (or any other amount of time). Narrative gameplay is most often used in any situation where the precise order of actions is unimportant. Structured gameplay is, at its heart, a rules sys tern that breaks up a character’s actions into what he could reasonably perform in a predetermined amount of time. If also gives each character in a scene the op portunity to perform actions in turn. It is most often used for players to play through combat situations, although the CM may decide to employ structured gameplay in certain non-combat scenes he feels would benefit from requiring the players to clearly de­ fine their characters' actions within a rule set. STRUCTURED GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW When using structured gameplay, the game is broken down into a series of rounds, each of which is further broken down into a series of turns During a single round, each Player Character and Non-Player Charac­ ter gets one turn, during which they have the opportu­ nity to accomplish tasks and perform various actions. Rounds can last for roughly a minute or so in time, although the elapsed time is deliberately not specified. Players should keep in mind that a round lasts long enough for their character to move to a new location and perform an important action. They should also re­ member that although each round is broken up into turns that happen sequentially in gameplay, narratively the turns are occurring at roughly the same time. Structured gameplay events (also called encounters) such as combat follow these steps: STEP 1: DETERMINE INITIATIVE At the beginning of the first round of combat, all play­ ers and NPCs need to determine in what order the characters will take their turns. This is referred to as the Initiative order To determine the Initiative order, each Player Character and NPC makes a Simple (-) Cool or Vigilance check (for more information on which to use, see the Cool or Vigilance? sidebar). Once all Initiative checks have been made, the CM notes down the results of each check and ranks them in order, from highest number of successes to lowest number of successes. If two checks are tied, the check with more O is ranked higher. If a Player Char­ acter and an NPC are still tied, the Player Character is ranked higher This is the Initiative order. STEP 2: ASSIGN INITIATIVE SLOTS Once the CM has determined the Initiative order, he notes which results were generated by Player Char­ acters, and which results were generated by NPCs. The results generated by Player Characters become Player Character Initiative slots. The results generated by NPCs become NPC Initiative slots. STEP 3: PARTICIPANTS TAKE TURNS Beginning at the top of the Initiative order, the play­ ers and CM fill each Initiative slot one at a time with a character turn. If the Initiative slot is a Player Charac­ ter Initiative slot, then the players agree on one Play­ er Character to fill the slot from amongst the Player Characters who have not acted that round. That Play­ er Character then takes this turn. If the Initiative slot is an NPC Initiative slot, then the GM chooses one NPC to fill the slot from amongst the NPCs who have not acted that round. That NPC then takes this turn. T H E TURNCDDL OR VIGILANCE? T wo different skills in Edge of the Empire can be used to determine Initiative: Cool and Vigi­ lance. Which skill should be used in a particular situation is determined by the situation at hand. Characters should determine their Initiative us­ ing the Cool skill when they are aware and ready for combat (or whatever situation results in us­ ing structured gameplay). For example, rolling to see who goes first in a quick draw gunfight, or springing an ambush on an unsuspecting enemy would require Cool, as Cool is a skill represent­ ing a character's ability to remain calm, collect­ ed, and focused on the task in front of them. Characters should determine their Initiative us­ ing the Vigilance skill when combat (or another situation resulting in structured gameplay) be­ gins unexpectedly. Two enemies walking around a corner and running into each other would both use Vigilance to determine Initiative, for example. Likewise, someone being ambushed would also use Vigilance to determine Initiative (and if they ended up going earlier in the Initiative order than their ambusher, clearly they were vigilant enough to spot the ambush at the last second!). It is important to note that different characters may use different skills to determine Initiative during the same combat, depending on their differing circumstances. Also, if the CM and players are unsure as to which of the two skills best applies to a given situation, they should default to using Vigilance. STEP 4: ROUND ENDS Once all NPCs and Player Characters have taken a turn, the round ends. At this point, certain effects that last until the “end of the round’’ may end. The GM also determines if the ongoing action warrants additional rounds, or if it has been resolved. If the ongoing action continues, repeat step three using the same Initiative order generated in step 1. If the action has been re­ solved and the encounter is over, proceed to step 5. STEP 5: ENCOUNTER ENDS Once the action has been resolved, the CM ends the encounter. At this point, any character abilities that may only be used “once per encounter" reset and any abilities that last “until the end of the encounter" ex­ pire. Each Player Character also has a chance to catch their breath and recover strain, and may take steps to help heal any incapacitated characters. Each character (whether a Player Character or a Non- Player Character) gets one turn to act during each round. During this turn, the character has the chance to undertake certain activities, such as moving from place to place, using his skills, and even attacking oth­ ers. The activities the character can perform during his turn are split into three categories: Incidentals, Maneuvers, and Actions. INCIDENTALS Incidentals are minor activities that characters can undertake that require extremely little time or ef­ fort, such as dropping something they’re holding or speaking to another character. There is no hard limit to the number of incidentals a character may perform during his turn, although the CM may veto excessive numbers of them or decide they are complex enough to warrant counting as a maneuver. The following are examples of incidentals: • Speaking to another character. • Dropping an item held in one’s hands. • Releasing someone the character is holding. • Minor movements such as shifting position, peek­ ing around a corner, or looking behind a person. CINEMATIC COMBAT E dge of the Empire strives to capture the pure cinematic thrill found in the Star Wars universe. Combat is frequent, fast-moving, and meant to showcase the talents and abilities of the Player Characters. The unique dice system of Edge of the Empire helps push the story-driven nature of the game forward. Even a single attack roll generates enough options (some good, some bad) to give the Came Master sufficient information to make combat far more than just a matter of rolling to hit and rolling to wound. In turn, the players are highly encouraged to provide interesting detail before rolling on an attack, in order to give the CM hooks in describing the results. Combat is similarly streamlined so the players do not bog down gameplay with too many tactical decisions; descriptions of their actions and the roll of the dice is sufficient to help visualize the violence. MANEUVERS Maneuvers are activities that are not complex enough to warrant a skill check, but do involve time and effort on the part of a character. Characters are allowed one maneuver during their turn, and certain circumstances may allow them a second maneuver as well (see be­ low). The following are some examples of maneuvers: • Aiming a weapon. • Moving one range band closer or farther away from an enemy (for more on range bands, see page 208). • Opening a door. • Diving behind cover. • Standing up. ACTIONS Actions are important activities that are vital to a character accomplishing goals. Each character may normally onlv oerform one action durine his turn, and MANEUVERS B ecause Edge of the Empire utilizes an abstract method of describing combat, movement is simi­ larly described in broad strokes. Characters often do far more than shoot their blasters in combat, include­ ing pulling out stimpacks to heal a wounded comrade, slicing through a computer to open a blast door, or scaling a wall to get an advantage on their opponents. Not all undertakings require a check. These mi­ nor activities are known as maneuvers and cover a wide range of activities that any character can per­ form. They require an investment of time and effort on the character’s part, but are simple enough that there is no chance of failure when doing them. Techni­ cally, characters perform maneuvers during narrative gameplay as well as encounters. However, maneuvers are tracked and defined during encounters because characters are more limited in their time and efforts by the frantic pace of conflict. MANEUVER LIMITATIONS A character may perform one free maneuver on his turn. He may also perform a second maneuver by vol­ untarily suffering two points of strain. (Characters may also perform a second maneuver through a particularly successful skill check, or by other means listed else­ where.) However, regardless of the source, a single character may not perform more than two maneu­ vers during his turn it will likely be the most important activity he under­ takes during his turn. Actions almost always involve performing a skill check, although certain character abilities may require using an action to activate them. The following are some examples of actions: • Slicing a computer. • Opening a locked door. • Firing a weapon. • Punching or grappling an opponent. • Instructing allies with a series of orders. • Performing first aid on an ally. • Sneaking up on a vigilant foe. • Climbing a cliff. Out of all of these options, the most common dur­ ing combat is likely attacking an opponent. Attacking an opponent requires a combat skill check, some­ times referred to in shorthand as a combat check or simply an attack MANEUVERS OUTSIDE A CHARACTER'S TURN In some cases, a character may even be able to per­ form a maneuver when it is not his turn. A storm- trooper rolling horribly on a Stealth check to ambush a character may generate a number of failures on his check. The CM may decide that the blunder allows his would-be victim the opportunity to perform a maneu­ ver, even though it is the stormtrooper’s turn. Any bonus maneuvers gained outside of a charac- PERSONAL MANEUVERS VERSUS STARSHIP MANEUVERS T his section deals primarily with maneuvers performed on the personal level—individual characters moving about and performing tasks. Starships also perform maneuvers to represent their mobility, evasion, and special moves. To distinguish the two types of maneuvers, the default use of the term applies to personal level maneuvers. Starship maneuvers are spe­ cifically prefaced with the word "starship” for easy reference. More information about star- ship maneuvers can be found in Chapter VII: Starships and Vehicles ter’s turn do not count towards the aforementioned limit of two maneuvers a character may perform dur­ ing his turn—specifically because it happens outside of the character's turn. These additional maneuvers are generally awarded at the providence of the CM, and thus there is no hard and fast limit to the num­ ber of maneuvers that can be awarded in this manner. However, the CM would be wise to limit the number of out-of-turn maneuvers each character performs each round to one or two at most. TYPES OF MANEUVERS The following is a list of the maneuvers a character can perform during combat. Please note that this list is not exhaustive. The entire point of maneuvers is that they can cover any activity relatively easy to perform that still requires some amount of time and effort. While these maneuvers are deliberately gen­ eral to cover as many options as possible, if a player comes up with something he wants his character to do that is not covered by this list, he should not dismiss the idea out of hand. Instead, he should explain what he’d like to accomplish to his CM, who can decide if it can realistically be performed in a single maneuver. Some activities may also require multiple maneu­ vers to perform. Generally, these maneuvers must be performed sequentially, without being interrupted by the character performing other maneuvers or actions, for the task to be successful. AIM During combat, a character can use the Aim maneuver to steady a weapon or line up a hit before attacking, granting a bonus to his next combat check. A charac­ ter only gains the benefit of aiming if he remains in his current position and does not perform any additional maneuvers or actions before his next combat check. Any damage that exceeds the character’s soak also negates the benefit of aiming. Aiming provides the character with one of the two following bonuses: • Cain □ on the next combat check. If the character spends two consecutive ma­ neuvers aiming, he gains □ □ on the next combat check. • Target a specific item carried by the target, or a specific part of the target. This could allow the character to attempt to strike or shoot a weapon from his opponent’s hand, for ex­ ample, or target an op­ ponent’s limb to cripple him. If the character spends one maneuver aiming to do this, his next combat check suffers ■ ■ If he spends two con­ secutive maneuvers aiming, the combat check suffers ■ instead. ASSIST Performing the assist maneuver allows an engaged ally to add □ to his next check. Several characters can use the assist maneuver to add more bonus □ to the engaged ally’s next check. All awarded bonus dice must be used on the assisted character’s next turn, otherwise they are discarded. The Came Master should use his own discretion when allowing Players to assist one another. Some actions simply do not benefit from assistance. GUARDED STANCE A character can take a maneuver to assume a guard­ ed stance, helping him defend against melee attacks. A character who performs this maneuver adds ■ to any combat checks he makes until the end of his next turn. However, he also gains melee defense 1 until the end of his next turn. INTERACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT Often a single maneuver is enough to interact with the environment around a character. This is a broad category of possible interactions, such as opening a blast door, ducking behind a wall, pressing a specific button on a control panel, or grabbing a blaster off of the ground. The following are some more specifi­ cally designed examples of interacting with the environment: • Moving a large item. Flipping over a table, shoving a barrel into a pursu­ er’s path, hefting a crate; all of these would take a maneuver to perform. ' • Opening or closing a door. Whether an elec­ tronic blast door or a primitive door with latches and hinges, opening or closing it takes a maneuver. • Taking cover. Ducking behind a door jam, crouch­ ing behind a crate, or peeking around a tree trunk; all of these allow the character to gain ranged de­ fense 1 (and some cover can grant a ranged de­ fense higher than 1 if particularly sturdy). It takes a maneuver to take cover, but once in cover, the character keeps the bonus unless the circumstanc­ es around him change so that he would no longer benefit from cover, or he moves out of cover. MANAGE GEAR Managing items and equipment is accomplished by this maneuver, which can cover the following options. • Draw, holster, ready, or load a weapon. This maneuver covers the basic manipulations of most weapons, such as drawing a vibroknife from its sheath, recharging a blaster rifle’s energy cells (provided the character has additional ammo at hand—see page 181), or drawing and prepping a thermal detonator for use. • Draw something from storage, or put it away. A character can perform a maneuver to retrieve an item from a pouch, backpack, satchel, bando­ lier, or some other accessible container. This can also be used to stow items in a similar fashion. MOUNT OR DISMOUNT Mounting and dismounting a domesticated animal such as a trained dewback or a tauntaun requires a maneu­ ver. (Successfully mounting an untrained animal, how­ ever, requires a Medium Survival check, which may be harder depending on how ornery the CM feels the animal is.) Similarly, mounting a vehicle, sliding into a cockpit, or otherwise engaging a vehicle for piloting or a gunnery station for use requires a maneuver as well. MOVE This maneuver allows the character to move within his environment. The game defines several different broad types of movement. When characters move, they do one of the following: • Change range increment. Performing this maneu­ ver allows a character to move between short and medium range relative to another person or object. This also allows characters to move between me­ dium and long range by performing two maneuvers, or between long and extreme range by performing two maneuvers. When covering long distances, mul­ tiple maneuvers do not have to be performed on the same turn, but the character is not considered to be in the new range increment until all required ma­ neuvers have been performed. For more detail on determining range, see Range Bands, page 208. • Engage or Disengage from an opponent. If a tar­ get is already within short range of a character, the character can perform a maneuver to engage that FLYING F light in Edge of the Empire is handled in two dif­ ferent ways. Vehicles and starships that fly use the rules found in Chapter VII to handle their flight. Some pieces of equipment allow individuals to mimic their flight and use these rules as well. However, some creatures or individuals can fly, but not at the same speeds as vehicles or mechanical devices such as jump packs. In these cases, these creatures or individuals simply move from one place to the other by flying, but still use the rules presented in this chapter for situations such as combat. Their flight is handled mostly narratively, with a common-sense approach. For example, a flying creature could easily fly over difficult or im­ passable terrain, or fly over water without having to swim through it. It could cover vertical distances in the same way that individuals in this game cover horizontal ones. However, there are some points to keep in mind concerning flying creatures. Creatures that can hover (such as insects orToy- darians, for example) rely on swiftly moving wings, bags of lighter-than-air gas, or other systems to move while staying above the ground. These sim­ ply move in the same manner as other creatures, with the following exceptions. Hovering creatures ignore difficult or impassable terrain as long as they can reasonably stay above it, and ignore the penalties for moving through water. They gener­ ally have to stay relatively close to the ground (within Medium range), unless noted otherwise. Creatures that can fly (such as most birds or mynocks) use aerodynamic principles such as lift to stay aloft. These follow all the same rules about terrain as creatures that hover. However, they have to maintain at least some speed to stay aloft, and thus while flying must spend one maneuver every turn to move (they can actually change position, or just circle or wheel in place and effectively remain where they are). Most flying creatures can move faster than hovering or ground creatures, and could move from long range to short range using a single maneuver. target. If the character is engaged with an opponent or adversary, he must perform a maneuver to dis­ engage with that opponent before moving to any other location. This only changes his range relative to his opponent from "engaged" to “short” ai represents the effort of backing away and avoiding his opponent’s attacks. Charac­ ters do not need to perform this maneu­ ver to leave an engagement consisting only of friendly characters or allies. Moving within short range. Performing this maneuver allows an unengaged char­ acter to move to another position that is currently within short range of him. DROP PRONE OR STAND FROM PRONE Dropping prone and standing from a prone posi­ tion each require a maneuver. Drop­ ping prone allows the character to add ■ to all ranged attacks made against him, although he also must add □ to all melee attacks made against him. PREPARATION Some actions require additional preparation to perform safely. The preparation maneuver is generally performed in conjunction with an­ other ability to confer a bonus, offset a penalty, or fulfill a re­ quirement. The individual tal­ ents or abilities that utilize the preparation maneuver define its specific effect. It is some­ times abbreviated under the requirements as “prepare.” ACTIONS D uring a character's turn, he generally has the chance to perform one primary activity. This is the character's action. Actions in­ clude any activity complex enough to warrant involving a skill check, and can range from slicing open a computer system to shoot­ ing a blaster. ACTION LIMITATIONS A character may only perform one action in a turn. Some characters may have abilities allowing them to perform an action as a maneuver. This does not vio­ late the limit of one action per turn, however, as the action now counts as a maneuver. TYPES OF ACTIONS There are five major types of actions a character can perform during his turn: exchanging an action for a maneuver, spending the action to activate an abil­ ity or talent, activating a Force power, performing a skill check, and performing a combat check. The last, performing a combat check, is actually a variation on performing a skill check. However, enough unique cir­ cumstances surround it that it requires its own entry. EXCHANGE AN ACTION FORA MANEUVER A character may exchange his action for an additional maneuver during his turn. He may then perform any maneuver he would be able to perform normally, fol­ lowing all the rules that govern maneuvers. However, he still may not perform more than two maneuvers during his turn, no matter how he gained access to them. SPEND AN ACTION TO ACTIVATE AN ABILITY Certain abilities or talents can require an action to ac­ tivate. When a character spends an action to activate an ability or talent (even if spending the action does not require a check or any other activity on the char­ acter's part), he has used his action for his turn. He may not take a second action, unless he specifically has an ability that would grant him a second action. ACTIVATE A FORCE POWER Most Force powers require an action to use. These are covered in more detail in Chapter VIII: The Force. PERFORM A SKILL CHECK The most common actions that most characters take during their turn are actions that require a skill check to resolve. In other words, these are activities for which suc­ cess is not guaranteed or for which the failure of the task may be important to the ongoing story. For example, walking from one place to another does not bring with it any inherent risk of failure (the characters are assumed to be competent enough to handle walking from one location to another), and even if they could fail, failing would not significantly change the ongoing story. How­ ever, trying to cross a chasm on a tightrope to escape pursuit both brings an inherent risk of failure (falling and dying) and failing can advance the story (whether or not the character escapes pursuit). Therefore, a Coordina­ tion check would be called for, and if it occurred during an encounter, it would require an action to perform. Most skill checks and what they can accomplish are covered in Chapter III: Skills. What a character can do with a skill outside of an encounter is the same as what he can do with it inside of an encounter. The only difference is that inside an encounter, he has certain time limits imposed. In fact, the GM can de­ determine that certain activities may require more than one action to perform, if they would normally take a great deal of time (or are time-consuming enough that they cannot be performed while the encounter continues; the character must wait for the encounter to end before attempting the activity). Combat checks, however, are unique enough that they re­ quire a separate de­ scription. PERFORM A COMBAT CHECK A player makes a com­ bat check when he uses a combat skill to attack a target. This is also referred to as an attack. The combat skills in Edge of the Empire consist of the following: Brawl, Gunnery, Melee, Ranged (Light), and Ranged (Heavy). All of these skills are covered in Chapter III: Skills. However, in brief, Brawl pertains to hand-to-hand combat without weap­ owns, Melee governs fighting with close com­ bat weapons such as knives and vibro-axes, Gunnery handles using heavy, crew-served weap­ owns, Ranged (Light) covers fighting with pistols, and Ranged (Heavy) covers fighting with rifles and other larger ranged weapons. The first and foremost point to keep in mind is that a combat check is a skill check. It follows all the rules and procedures for making a skill check, including the steps for assembling the dice pool. However, there are additional steps included in a combat check. All the steps a combat check follows are detailed here. 1. DECLARE AN ATTACK A ND SELECT TARGETS The character chooses to make an attack. He selects what skill he will use to make the attack, and if the skill requires a weapon to use, which weapon he will be using. He then declares the target of his attack. 2. ASSEMBLE THE DICE POOL The character then assembles his dice pool based on the skill, its characteristic, and any applicable talents and other abilities. Certain conditions, such as the effect of a Critical Injury or an environmental effect, may also contribute dice to the dice pool. See page 18 for more information on building a dice pool. The difficulty of a combat check depends on wheth­ er the attack is a ranged attack (using Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), or Gunnery) or a melee attack (using Melee or Brawn). Melee attack difficulties are always Average ( ^ ^ ) . Ranged attack difficulties depend on the distance the target is from the active character, or in other words, the range band the target occupies. Table 6 -1 : Ranged Attack Difficulties lists difficul­ ties as they relate to different range bands. See page 208 for more information about range bands. TABLE 6-1: RANGED ATTACK DIFFICULTIES Range Band Difficulty Engaged Easy ( ^ ) plus modifiers depending on weapon used, see page 210. Short Easy (+ } j Medium Average ( 4 + ) Long Hard (+ + +) Extreme Daunting (+ + + +) 3. POOL RESULTS A ND DEAL DAMAGE Once the player rolls the dice pool for his character, he evaluates the results. As with any skill check, the check must generate more & than Y to be successful. When making a combat check, if the check is suc­ cessful each uncanceled # adds + 1 damage to a successful attack. If the attack affects multiple tar­ gets, the additional damage is added to each target. 4. RESOLVE O AND ^ As with every skill check, O and ($) can be spent to gain incidental beneficial effects on a combat check. However, just as the rules governing encounters are somewhat more regimented than the rules governing narrative gameplay, some of the options governing the spending of O and (£ are more clearly defined. In encounters, the player controlling the activated char­ acter determines how his character spends O and (£, unless the CM has a specific reason to decide for him instead. The first and foremost way to spend O and in an attack is to activate a Critical Injury or active weapon qualities. As described on page 158 and 216, each weapon has a Critical Rating that consists of a numer­ ic value. The user can spend that many O to inflict one Critical Injury on the target, in addition to regular effects and damage. Remember, a Critical Injury can only be triggered on a successful hit that deals dam­ age that exceeds the target’s soak value. For more in­ formation on Critical Injuries, see page 21 6. Weapon qualities are special effects and abilities that apply only when using that particular weapon. They come in two forms, active and passive. Active abilities require the user to spend a certain number of O to trigger them. Generally this is O O although some qualities may require more or less. Passive qualities always grant their effect. Qualities may inflict effects on a target, which unless specified otherwise, are always in addition to other effects, Critical Injuries, and damage. In addition to always counting as an additional (J) can be spent to activate these abilities as well. A may be spent to inflict one Critical Injury (no matter what the Critical Rating of the weapon is). In addition, a may be spent to activate one weapon quality, no matter how many O it would normally take to do so. R anged attacks or a melee attacks are two different types of attacks, meaning they are also two different types of combat checks A ranged attack is an attack made with a ranged weapon of some sort, most likely an attack made using the Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy) or Gun­ nery skill. A melee attack is an attack made in close combat with an opponent with a weapon designed for use in close combat, most likely an attack made with the Melee or Brawl skill. However, there are other options for spending O and as well. A list of the most common can be found on Table 6 -2 : Spending O and (|) in Com­ bat on page 206. Keep in mind, these are not in­ tended to be the only options available. As always, players and CMs may invent other ways to spend O and (£) depending on the specific circumstances of the encounter, and any option that the players and GM agree upon can be viable. 5. RESOLVE <§} AND ^ In the same fashion that the controlling player de­ termines how his character spends O and in his combat check, the GM then determ ines how to spend any <§> and ^ generated in the check. By default, the GM determines how <§> and ^ are spent, although in some cases (such as checks made by NPCs) he may give the players the option to spend these instead. Unlike O and (£, most weapons do not have spe­ cific options for spending <§> and ^ —although this is not always the case. Some particularly volatile or dangerous weapons do have these options, and if they do, the options are detailed in the weapon’s description. There are specific options for spend­ ing <§) and ^ in encounters, however, and the most common of these can be found on Table 6 -3 : Spending <§> and ^ in Combat on page 207. As with O and ($), keep in mind that these are not intended to be the only options available. As al­ ways, CMs may invent other ways to spend <g> and ^ depending on the specific circumstances of the encounter, and any option that the players and CM agree on can be viable. 6. REDUCE DAMAGE, APPLY TO W O UND THRESHOLD, AND APPLY CRITICAL INJURIES When a character suffers damage, he reduces the damage received by his soak value. If any damage re­ mains after this reduction, he suffers that many wounds. If the net result is zero or negative, the char­ acter suffers no wounds. If the character suffers dam­ age from multiple hits in an attack, he applies his soak value to each hit individually. For more information on damage and wounds, see Wounds, Strain, and States of Health on page 215. EXAMPLE: APPLYING SOAK Lowhhrick is wearing padded armor, and with his natural Brawn, he has a total soak value of six. A successful hit with a blaster pistol deals nine points of damage to him. His soak value absorbs six points of damage, resulting in three wounds. Later, Lowhhrick is attacked with a knife. The attack succeeds, but only inflicts five points of damage. His soak of six absorbs the entire blow and Lowhhrick takes no wounds. An attack may also generate a Critical Injury. This may occur because the weapon's Critical Rating triggered, or because the target suffered wounds greater than its wound threshold. More about Critical Ratings was ex­ plained in Step 4. Resolving O and $D. When a Critical Injury is inflicted, the attacker rolls percentile dice on Table 6 -1 0 : Critical Injury Re­ sult on page 217. The result of the dice roll indi­ cates which Critical Injury is applied. Some weapons and talents modify this critical hit roll, potentially making a critical hit more or less effective. If an attack generates enough O to trigger more than one critical, the character makes a single critical roll, adding +10 to the result for each additional time the critical rating is triggered. DEFENSE D efense, or more specifically, defense rating, is one of the factors determining how difficult it is to land a successful attack during combat. Defense rating represents the abilities of shields, armor, or other de­ fensive systems to deflect attacks entirely, or absorb or lessen incoming blows. Defense rating is most commonly provided by shields, and as such is usually limited to vehicles and starships.

A character adds a number of ■ equal to his defense rating to all combat checks directed against him. MELEE AND RANGED DEFENSE A characters’ defense rating can be characterized as one of three types: general defense rating, melee de­ SOAK « character’s soak value helps protect him from in­ coming wounds. Most creatures and characters have a default soak value equal to their Brawn rat­ ing. Most types of arm or or other forms of protec­ tion provide additional soak (see Chapter V: Gear and Equipment). When taking damage from attacks (any action involving a combat skill check) or other sources of physical damage (such as being struck by a falling rock or being hit by a landspeeder), the character may reduce the damage taken by his soak value. Af­ ter calculating the total amount of damage inflicted, subtract the total soak value from that damage total. The result is the number of wounds the character suffers. If the soak reduces the damage to zero or less than zero, then the character takes no damage. fense rating, and ranged defense rating. General de­ fense rating works against all combat checks direct­ ed against the character. Melee defense rating only works against close combat checks directed against the character (Brawl and Melee checks). Ranged defense rating only works against ranged combat checks directed against the character (Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), and Gunnery checks). Multiple sources of defense do not stack However, the character always uses the best defense rating available to him. If he possesses a defense rating of 1 against all attacks, but a defense rating of 2 against melee attacks, he applies the defense 2 against all close combat attacks. If the character suffers multiple hits from a single at­ tack (such as from a weapon with auto-fire), he may apply his soak to each hit separately. Different sources of soak stack, such as heavy as­ sault armor and subdermal plating. Multiple applica­ tions of the same source do not stack—a character cannot wear three suits of heavy assault armor and stack the soak bonuses from each. Soak does not reduce strain inflicted on a target, except in specific instances (such as with weapons with the Stun Damage quality). RANGE BANDS E dge of the Empire relies on broad terms used to describe ranges and distances. Rather than have a player’s attention focused on a grid, counting squares, Edce of the Empire uses more abstract means to rep­ resent position, distances, and ranges, thus allowing the players to focus on the action and the adventure. The distance between two points—people, objects, or adversaries—is defined by general range catego­ ries. These range categories are used to determine how far a ranged attack can reach, how far apart two people are from each other, how much effort is needed to move between two places, and so on. The most common ranges are short, medium, long, and extreme range. Another relative position exists—en­ gaged—to represent characters that are in extremely close proximity to each other. THE FIVE RANGE BANDS For ease of play, distance in Edge of the Empire is divided up into five different bands, from engaged to extreme. As always, the GM has final say in determin­ ing the range between the attacker and the target. With the engaged status and the range bands, the GM is free to describe things dynamically and set scenes without having to worry about exact distances. Exact distances in meters do not matter. The details and adventure come first, creating a vivid picture for the players, while allowing the GM to quickly provide the mechanical information players need to use their actions and build strategies. ENGAGED To reflect two or more targets close enough to inter­ act directly with each other, there is a special range status called engaged. Two characters engaged with each other are in very close proximity. A soldier needs to be engaged with a target to hit him with his vibro- sword. Two or more characters engaged with each other is called an engagement. Engaged is also used to indicate that a person is close enough to an item to use it. A slicer needs to be en­ gaged with a security terminal to attempt to hack it. A pilot needs to be engaged with his starship to board it. A bounty hunter needs to be engaged with a tree if he wants to hide behind it for cover while stalking his prey. The engaged status simply indicates that two things are close enough to each other to directly interact. The best way to consider engaged is as a sub­ category of short range. Obviously, someone can be slightly further away if they're at short range, rather than if they’re engaged with someone. However, the distance is relatively minor. Thus, spending a maneu­ ver to move to engage someone or something is as much a matter of moving into combat (or out of com­ bat) cautiously enough to avoid a return blow—or flip­ ping open and focusing one’s attention on a device— as much as it is moving a physical distance. SHORT RANGE Short range indicates up to several meters between targets. Many thrown weapons and small firearms are most accurate at short range. Two people in short RELATIVE POSITIONING B ecause of the narrative, abstract way in which distance is measured, both the players and Came Master must be aware of how positioning relative to two or more targets is measured. Once combat begins, the Came Master will tell each play­ er where he is relative to the opponents—it is then up to the player to track his range relative to those opponents as the battle progresses. For example, during a battle within a huge hangar bay, the characters are ambushed by four storm- troopers—two approach from one side and two on the other—considered at the medium range band to the characters. During their turns, the characters split up to attack. Two of the players move towards one group of stormtroopers, getting within short range can talk comfortably without raising their voices. Moving to another spot within short range is usually easy to do and generally only requires one maneuver. MEDIUM RANGE Medium range can be up to several dozen meters away. More reliable pistols can reach to medium range. Few thrown weapons can reach this far. Two people in medi­ um range of each other need to talk loudly to hear each other. Moving from short range to medium range takes little exertion, and generally requires one maneuver. LONG RANGE Long range is further than a few dozen meters. Blaster rifles, mounted weapons, and weapons that use the Gunnery skill can reliably reach this far without too much trouble. Two people in long range of each other need to yell loudly to hear each other. Moving from medium range to long range requires two maneuvers, as it is more time consuming than moving between medium range and short range. This means that in most cases, a char­ acter cannot close the distance between short and long range in a single round, as it would take three maneuvers (one for short to medium, two for medium to long). EXTREME RANGE Extreme range is the farthest range at which two targets can interact. High-tech sniper weaponry and some ve­ hicle-mounted armaments may reach out to this range. Two people at extreme range may not be able to hear each other even if they shout. Moving between long range and extreme range can be time-consuming and exerting, and requires two maneuvers. This means that in most cases, a character can move the entire distance between long and extreme range in a single round, but will suffer strain or give up his action to do so. range, and the other group moves to the opposite set of stormtroopers. Both groups of characters are now within short range to their specific targets, but medium range to the other group of targets. The difference between personal and planetary ranges of scale should be considered separately. At a planetary scale, two starships attacking each oth­ er at short range does not translate to being short at a personal range—the distance is considered far past extreme for a personal range, even with Ranged (Heavy) weapons. Similarly, two docked ships are considered engaged at a planetary scale, but a gun battle on the surface of either ship utilizes the personal range bands where characters may be at long or even extreme range from each other. PLANETARY SCALE RANGES The distances and range bands presented here are based on the personal scale for characters. Starships and vehicles may use these range bands, or much larger range bands, based on the needs of the story. On a plan­ et’s surface, these range bands may suffice, while in the depths of outer space in the midst of a heated starship battle, the range bands represent much larger distances and positions. See the starship section for more details on planetary and starship-based ranges and distances. A good guideline is that the close range on planetary scale picks up where the extreme range of personal scale ends—it’s the next step in ranged bands. However, the scale is so much bigger that a single person could never use maneuvers to move next to a target that’s ‘'close" to him on a planetary scale—the distance may be up to several kilometers and take hours of walking. Further range bands on a planetary scale would be even more extreme. Planetary scale ranges are explained further on page 238 in Chapter VII: Starships and Vehicles CUSTOM SKILLS IN COMBAT S ome players may have characters that use cus­ tom combat skills. This is acceptable within the game (as long as the GM is fine with it). However, many of the rules in this chapter are written with the five basic combat skills in mind, and do not mention custom combat skills specifically. Thus, players need to determine beforehand whether these skills are used to make ranged attacks or close combat attacks. Ideally, they should deter­ mine what existing skill their new, custom skill is most similar to, and apply the same modifiers to their new skill that apply to the original skill. ADDITIONAL COMBAT MODIFIERS T he prior sections cover the fundamentals of making a basic combat check. However, combat rarely oc­ curs in a vacuum. Any number of things can modify a combat check, from environmental factors to actions the character chooses. This section discusses those modifiers. The first part of this section covers conditional and situational modifiers. The second part of this section covers out­ side factors such as environmental effects. CONDITIONAL AND SITUATIONAL MODIFIERS Character choices can modify combat checks in many ways, some good and some bad. These choices can often provide additional benefits, as well. MAKING RANGED ATTACKS AT ENGAGED TARGETS Sometimes, characters may want to attack a target that's engaged with another character. If the two char­ acters are both enemies, the attacker may not worry about whom he might hit. However, if one of the char­ acters is an ally, then things become more dangerous. When attacking a target engaged with an ally, the attacker upgrades the difficulty of the check by one (for more on upgrading difficulty, see page 21). In addition, if the attacker’s check succeeds but he gener­ ates at least that ^ is automatically spent to make the attacker hit one of the individuals engaged with the target (of the CM's choice), instead of the target. MAKING RANGED ATTACKS WHILE ENGAGED Sometimes, characters may want to make a ranged attack while they’re engaged with an opponent. Such an action can be risky; a character may find it hard to take the time to line up a shot while an opponent is swinging a vibro-ax at him! Any opponent engaged with the character when he makes a ranged attack (no matter who the target is), TABLE 6-4: RANGED MODIFIERS Condition Modifier Engaged w/Ranged (Light) +1 difficulty Engaged w/Ranged (Heavy) + 2 difficulty Engaged w/Gunnery May not make Gunnery checks when engaged with an opponent. may add □ to his next Brawl or Melee check against that character. He automatically loses this bonus if ei­ ther he or the character are no longer engaged with the other. In addition, the difficulty of some ranged attacks increases while engaged, and other ranged attacks become impossible. See Table 6 -4 : Ranged M odi­ fiers for more information. ATTACKING PRONE TARGETS AND ATTACKING WHILE PRONE A character who is knocked down, unconscious, or willingly drops prone is considered prone. Prone characters are easier to hit with certain com­ bat checks and find it harder to use certain combat skills. A character gains □ when attacking a prone target with a Melee or Brawl check. A prone character suffers ■ when making a Melee or Brawl check from a prone position. Prone characters are harder to hit with ranged at­ tacks but suffer no penalties when making ranged at­ tacks. When a character attacks a prone target with a Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), or Gunnery check, he suffers ■ Some attacks or weapons may cause a character to become prone—this is indicated in individual weap­ on, talent, or creature attack entries. Getting knocked prone may be the result of a failed Coordination check or the activation of a weapon’s special quality. TWO-WEAPON COMBAT A character may opt to carry a Ranged (Light) weapon or a one-handed melee weapon in each hand, increas­ ing his volume of attacks at the expense of accuracy. When attacking with two weapons, the charac­ ter must be wielding two weapons that can each be reasonably held and wielded in one hand. Generally, these weapons are Ranged (Light) weapons—gener­ ally pistols and grenades—and one-handed melee or brawl weapons. If it’s unclear whether or not a weap­ on can be wielded one-handed, the GM makes the final determination as to if it can be used. To make the attack, he performs a combined check First, the character denotes one weapon as the primary weapon. When making the combined check, he will be attacking with this weapon. He then determines what skills and characteristics he would use when making attacks with his primary weapon, and his secondary weapon (the other weapon he wields). Finally, he determines his target. GRAPPLING E dge of the Empire, being a more narrative game, does not possess specific rules for grappling. Instead, the unarmed combat rules have been designed to narratively cover mul­ tiple unarmed fighting techniques, including grappling. For this reason, the basic Brawl attack allows characters to deal damage to the target’s strain threshold, and can knock them prone and disorient them. This allows for the narrative of a grapple (which is often intended to incapacitate without killing) without additional rules. To assemble the dice pool for this check, the player compares the skills that would be used to make an at­ tack with each weapon, and compares the characteris­ tics that would be used to make an attack with each weapon. He then takes the skill that he has lower ranks in, and the characteristic that he has lower ranks in, and uses this skill and characteristic to assemble his dice pool. It’s very possible that the ranks in either the skills or characteristics are equal, in which case he can use either. If both checks would use the same skill or characteristic, he simply uses that skill or characteristic. He then compares the difficul­ ty of the two combat checks he would make with each of his two weapons to hit his target, and selects the check with the higher basic difficulty (more ^ ). He then increases the difficulty by one if the two skills in the combined check were the same, and by two if they were different. He then makes the check. If he succeeds, he hits with his primary weapon as normal. He may also spend O O or ^ to hit with his secondary weapon as well. If both weapons hit, he may spend additional O or to activate qualities from either weapon. Each hit deals its base damage, + 1 damage per uncanceled success. UNARMED COMBAT Although most characters probably feel more com­ fortable going into a fight with a good blaster in their hand, there are times they must rely on their fists, feet, or other appendages. Of course, some species, such as Wookiees, positively relish a good brawl. Characters fighting unarmed generally use the Brawl combat skill. Unlike other combat skills, the Brawl skill is designed to be used independently of any weapons (although there are some weapons that can be used in conjunction with the Brawl skill). When making an unarmed combat check using Brawl, the character’s attack has a base damage of his Brawn rating, a range of engaged, a Critical Rating of 5, and the Disorient 1 and Knockdown qualities. Finally, when making a Brawl attack, the attacker can choose to deal damage to the target’s strain thresh­ old instead of its wound threshold, still reducing the damage by the target’s soak. Unlike other weapons, Brawl weapons augment this basic attack. Brawl weapons can add damage to this attack (as indicated in the Brawl profile on page 166), and may have an improved Critical Rating and additional weapon qualities. When using a Brawl weapon, the user can choose to use its Critical Rating instead of the standard Brawl Critical Rating. He also adds the additional weapon qualities to the qualities already provided by the Brawl attack. If the weapon provides an improved version of an existing quality, the character uses the improved version.

This includes broken bottles, rocks, sticks, and the like. Improvised weapons use the Melee skill, and like all Melee weapons, the attacker adds his Brawn to the damage dealt. Just like weapons with the Inferior quality, improvised weapons generate one automatic <§> on any check. Improvised weapons deal damage based on their size and general weight, as described in Table 6 -5 : Improvised Weapons Any attack roll that results in a ^ or <§> <§> indicates that the impro­ vised weapon breaks and is useless in further rounds of combat. Large improvised weapons also require two hands to use as long as the user is silhouette 1. SIZE DIFFERENCES (SILHOUETTES) Generally, it is a character’s skill that governs his chances of hitting a target. However, some targets are easier to hit than others, usually because of their size. Size, or silhouette, is usually used to determine the difficulty of attacks made from vehicles or star- ships (as described in Chapter VII: Starships and Vehicles), as vehicle weapons are powerful and long- ranged enough that relative sizes matter more than distance. However, silhouettes can affect attack dif­ ficulties in standard combat as well. When a character makes an attack against a target with a silhouette two points or more larger than he is, he decreases the difficulty of the check by one. When a character makes an attack against a target with a silhouette two or more points smaller than he is, he increases the difficulty of the check by one. (Ve­ hicles and starships can have an even more difficult time shooting at targets with greater differences in silhouettes, but when it comes to characters, checks are only modified somewhat due to size). Table 6 -6 : Silhouettes and Characters has a list of example silhouettes that covers the size of most creatures the PCs may encounter. The most impor­ tant thing to remember is that most characters are silhouette I .

Rodians, Trandoshans, Twi’leks, humanoid droids, Bothans, and most humanoid species. 2 Dewbacks, wampas, tauntauns, banthas, most riding animals. 3 Rancors, krayt dragons, other large and dangerous creatures. 4 + There are some creatures in the galaxy even larger than those listed. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS T he galaxy is made up of countless environments, from the frozen wastes of Hoth to the steamy jun­ gles of Yavin 4 and the kilometer-high skyscrapers of Coruscant. Characters can often find themselves fighting in hazardous or exotic circumstances, from the cold hard vacuum of space to the infernal heat of a volcanic planet. Canny combat­ ants know that taking advantage of their en­ vironment can often make all the difference between triumph and defeat in an engagement. The following sections cover rules imposed by those environments. CONCEALMENT (DARKNESS, SMOKE, AND INTERVENING TERRAIN). Concealment is a situation that occurs when a character is harder to spot because of environmental effects such as darkness, smoke, tall grass, or mist. Concealment im­ poses penalties on ranged attacks and sight-based skill checks such as Perception. Conversely, it can provide bonuses for other skill checks, such as Stealth. The exact bonuses and penalties can be modified by the CM if needed. However, in general, conceal­ ment can be divided into levels based on how obscur­ ing the concealment is. See Table 6 -7 : Concealment for examples of different types of concealment. In each case, the type of concealment adds a number of ■ equal to the “dice added” entry to any Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy), Gunnery, and Perception checks against targets with concealment. Alternative­ ly, it adds a number of □ equal to the "dice added” entry to any Stealth checks made by a character with concealment. These bonuses or setbacks may also be added to other skills if the CM feels it’s appropriate. TABLE 6-7: CONCEALMENT □ice Added Examples + 1 Mist, shadow, waist-high grass. + 2 Fog, the darkness of early morning or late evening, thick, shoulder-high grass. + 3 Heavy fog, thick and choking smoke, the darkness of night, dense, head-high underbrush and thick grass. COVER When the blasters start firing, most characters dive for cover. To keep things simple, being behind some sort of cover—a rock, crate, wall, or vehicle, for example—in­ creases the character's ranged defense by 1 and can add ■ to certain skill checks, such as Perception. A sin­ gle ■ is sufficient for most situations, although the CM may add additional ■ if the target is particularly well covered, such as a target firing from within a trench, in­ side a blockhouse, or any other prepared position. The same holds true for the increase in ranged defense. DIFFICULT AND IMPASSABLE TERRAIN Difficult terrain is a catch-all description of terrain that is hard to move through or over. It can include tight pas­ sageways, slippery ice, thick undergrowth, loose rubble, shifting sand, or waist-deep water (or any number of other circumstances). Essentially, it's terrain that char­ acters move through with difficulty. Characters entering or moving through difficult terrain must perform twice as many maneuvers to move the same distance they would in normal terrain. Impassable terrain is a description of terrain that is simply impossible to move through via maneuvers. This includes sheer cliffs, walls higher than a character can reach through jumping, or deep pits. Impassable terrain is not always an insurmountable obstacle, but it is an obstacle that requires special skills to circumvent. De­ pending on the impassable terrain in question and the resources at the character’s disposal, the CM may allow the character to overcome impassable terrain by using a skill, probably the Athletics or Coordination skill (see Chapter III: Skills). During an encounter, this means the character must spend at least one action (and pos­ sibly give up one or more maneuvers) to accomplish this. GRAVITY Although antigravity has existed in the galaxy for thousands of years, characters might still find them­ selves in a situation where they are away from an anti- grav device, floating in open space, or walking in the crushing gravity of a supergiant planet. Normal gravity is the default and does not affect any skill checks, attacks, and the like. Most habitable planets possess gravity close enough to normal as to be unnoticeable. Starships and space stations also possess devices that provide normal gravity. However, sometimes the characters end up in an environment without normal gravity. Heavier than normal gravity adds up to ■ ■ ■ to any Brawn-based skill checks (except Resilience) and the Coordination skill, depending on how heavy the gravity is. Lighter than normal gravity adds up to □ □ □ t o any Brawn-based skill checks (except Resil­ ience) and the Coordination skill, depending on how light the gravity is. Zero gravity, on the other hand, does not grant any □ o r H to Brawn or Agility-based checks, because moving in zero gravity is completely different than moving in a gravity field. Characters can move in three dimensions in zero gravity, but they count all movement as through dif­ ficult terrain, due to having to constantly grab handholds, evaluate angles, and so-forth. A character’s encumbrance threshold does not change due to different gravity, and items still main­ tain their usual encumbrance. This is because an item’s weight may change, but its size and mass (and therefore its inertia) do not. Those pesky details can prove an unpleasant surprise to inexperienced spac­ ers who attempt to shift something large and heavy while in zero gravity. WATER AND SWIMMING Bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, oceans, or swamps are types of terrain encountered on most planets in the galaxy, and sometimes characters must cross them. Most species have some ability to swim through liquid water, although some spe­ cies are more adapted to it than others. Unless o th ­ erwise noted, characters treat any body of water as difficult terrain. The CM may also decide that some bodies of water, such as a river with a swift current or an ocean in a storm, are so difficult to move through that they require a successful A thlet­ ics check to swim. In this case, swimming through the water requires at least one action as well as any number of maneuvers to traverse. If completely submerged in water, a character can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to his Brawn characteristic. Once this number is reached, the character starts to drown and is treated as suf­ focating on each successive round (until he surfaces or finds some other source of air). VACUUM For spacers, vacuum is an all-too-familiar and ex­ tremely dangerous environment, lurking just outside the protective hull of their starship. Vacuum is not just the lack of breathable air; the lack of pressure and ex­ treme heat or cold can cause veins to rupture, blood to boil, and delicate membranes to freeze or tear. When exposed to vacuum without protective gear, a character may hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to his Brawn characteristic. Once this number is reached, the character begins suffocating. However, each round a character is exposed to vacuum, he also suffers three wounds. When the character exceeds his wound threshold, he is incapacitated and suffers one Critical Injury as normal, plus one additional Critical Injury each additional round he is exposed to vacuum (which likely will quickly result in death). This is in addi­ tion to the Critical Injuries he suffers from suffocating. FIRE, ACID, AND CORROSIVE ATMOSPHERES Fundamentally, the effects of fire, acids, and corrosive atmospheres are treated with the same rules. When exposed to a fire, acid, or corrosive atmospheres, the CM determines how dangerous the situation is by ap­ plying a rating. This rating is generally between 1 and 10, although higher ratings may also apply. A lower rat­ ing typically indicates minor, low-heat fire or mildly cor­ rosive liquid or atmosphere. The higher the rating, the hotter the fire or the more corrosive the atmosphere. See Table 6 -8 : Fire, Acid, and Corrosive Atmo­ spheres for some examples of different ratings. Each round, a character subjected to one of these hazards suffers wounds equal to its rating at the be­ ginning of his turn. This damage persists until he is no longer exposed to the hazard. In the case of some cor­ rosive atmospheres, the GM may decide they do not cause damage unless inhaled. In this case, the character can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to his Brawn before having to breathe and suffer the damage. It is primarily up to the GM as to how long the dam­ age from one of these sources lasts. Acids usually ne­ gate themselves after a certain period of time (as few as several rounds, or as long as several minutes or hours). Fires burn for as long as they have a fuel source, which again could be very briefly, or for a very long time. A corrosive atmosphere, on the other hand, usually deals damage as long as the character is exposed to it. Putting out fire/neutralizing acid: A victim might be able to stop the damage by rolling around on the ground by making a Coordination check. This is an Average check on hard surfaces such as the deck of a spaceship, or an Easy (^ ) check on grass or soft ground. Jumping into a body of water stops the damage immediately. In the case of acid, it is up to the GM to determine if the same procedures negate the damage, or if he must apply some neutralizing substance instead. The only way to prevent damage from a corrosive atmosphere is to leave it. SUFFOCATION A suffocating character suffers three strain at the beginning of each of his turns, until he is no longer suffocating (how to stop suffocating depends entirely on the circumstances that led to the character suf­ focating in the first place, but usually involves reach­ ing a breathable atmosphere, or removing something preventing the character from breathing). Once he exceeds his strain threshold, the character is inca­ pacitated. In addition, at the beginning of each of his subsequent turns, if the character is still suffocating, he suffers one Critical Injury. This continues until he stops suffocating or he dies. TABLE 6-8: FIRE, ACID, AND CORROSIVE ATMOSPHERES Rating Example 1-2 Campfires, mildly caustic substances such as concentrated industrial cleansers, air filled with ash and fumes from a heavy fire. 3-5 Flammable liquids and flame projectors, dangerous substances such as industrial acids, air contaminated by chemical leaks. 6-9 Welding torches, weaponized acids, atmospheres with substantial parts dangerous gases such as ammonia. 10 + Lava, blast furnaces, atmospheres completely made of unbreathable and hazardous gases such as ammonia methane mixes with acid vapors. TABLE 6-9: FALLING DAMAGEFALLING Gravity kills. If a character falls from a height, the GM should determine the distance between where the character falls from and his point of impact below, then apply the closest comparable range band. Then, consult Table 6 -9 : Falling Damage to determine the damage suffered. Damage is reduced by soak; however, the strain suffered is not. A character can reduce the damage taken from fall­ ing by making an Average Athletics or Co­ ordination check. Each & reduces the damage suf­ fered by one, while each Advantage reduces the strain suffered by one. A could, at the GM’s discretion, reduce the overall distance fallen by one range band Range Damage Strain Short 10 10 Medium 30 20 Long Incapacitated, C ritical Injury a t + 5 0 30 Extreme Incapacitated, Critical Injury at + 7 5 (or death at GM’s discretion) 40 as the character grabs onto a handhold or does some­ thing else to slow his fall. WOUNDS, STRAIN, AND STATES OF HEALTH I n the fast-paced, high-action setting of Edge of the Em ­ pire, characters are sure to find themselves in the thick of things, and are likely going to pick up a few cuts and bruises along the way. A character’s health is tracked us­ ing two separate yet similar systems: strain and wounds. W OUNDS AND W O UND THRESHOLD A wide variety of effects can inflict physical dam age- blaster shots, an angry wampa’s claws, frag grenades, and falling. Damage to a character's physical body is tracked using wounds. Each point of damage inflicts one wound on a character. A character can only with­ stand so many wounds before he is incapacitated. This is represented by the character's wound threshold. EXCEEDING WOUND THRESHOLD When a PC suffers wounds greater than his wound threshold, he is knocked out and incapacitated un­ til his wounds are reduced so that they no longer exceed his wound threshold (likely through healing). He also immediately suffers one Critical Injury. In some rare and dire circumstances, this could re­ sult in the PC’s death. STATES OF HEALTH P layer Characters may pass through several states of health over the course of their adven­ tures. The state of health is a general representa­ tion on their overall fitness or well being. A character is unwounded and operating at peak performance if he is currently suffering from no wounds and has no injuries. A character is wounded if he has any number of wounds less than his wound threshold. At this point, he’s suffered a few cuts, bruises, and scrapes. However, he has not taken any perma­ nent or incapacitating damage. He’s a bit bat­ tered, but he’s still hale and hearty overall. A character is critically injured if he is currently suffering from any number of Critical Injuries, regardless of how many wounds he may have. Critical Injuries are actual injuries that have some sort of detrimental effect. A character may be critically injured and wounded. A character is incapacitated once he has suf­ fered more wounds than his wound threshold or more strain than his strain threshold. Incapaci­ tation means that a character is unconscious and no longer able to act until the number of wounds he is suffering is decreased below his wound threshold. Since exceeding a character's wound thresh­ old triggers a Critical Injury check, it is pos­ sible for an incapacitated character to also be C ritically Injured. When non-Player Characters and creatures suf­ fer wounds greater than their wound threshold, they are defeated (unless they are a high-level opponent such as a nemesis). Being defeated by exceeding their wound threshold usually entails death, but the overall interpretation is up to the CM. The CM can decide that they pass out due to shock, are so crippled that they can no longer fight, are knocked unconscious, or any other option that fits his plans for the ongo­ ing narra­ tive. Since non-nem ­ esis char­ acters do not track strain sepa­ rately, but apply strain damage as wounds to their wound thresh­ old, what hap­ pens once they are defeated may also de­ pend on whether they were defeated due to strain damage or wound damage. When wounds exceed a charac­ ter’s wound threshold, the charac­ ter should track how many wounds he’s exceeded the threshold by, to a maximum of twice the wound threshold. He must heal wounds until his wounds are below his wound threshold before he is no longer incapacitated. STRAIN AND STRAIN THRESHOLD While wounds and injury represent potentially life- threatening damage, a number of other stressors and effects can impair a character. Collectively, this is referred to as strain. Any effect that impairs the character, but does not inflict physical harm or wounds, is considered strain. Spending hours wan­ dering through Tatooine’s blistering deserts, a mi­ nor shock from an electric console, being battered around the inside of a trash com pactor—all of these could represent types of strain. Weapons with a stun setting or other effects that impair or hinder a character generate strain. Additionally, effects that would cause stress, fear, anxiety, or emotional turmoil also generate strain. Losing one’s cool in combat during a bombardment, being berated by a superior officer, waking up to re­ alize one has been imprisoned by the Hutts, or be­ ing boarded by an Imperial search team while smug­ gling goods could all represent incidents that result in strain on a character. Strain can accumulate slowly as environmen­ tal effects, or be gained in chunks when a PC is rattled by an effect that doesn’t cause dam­ age, but does impair him. Characters can also voluntarily suffer strain to trigger certain effects. The most common use is to voluntarily suffer two points of strain to gain one additional ma­ neuver during a character’s turn. Some special talents may require the char­ acter to suffer one or more points of strain to activate. EXCEEDING STRAIN THRESHOLD When a character has suffered strain greater than his strain thresh­ old, he becomes inca­ pacitated until his strain is reduced so that it no longer exceeds his strain threshold. He is likely unconscious, or may just be so dazed and stag­ gered that he's completely un­ aware of his surroundings and unable to interact with them. When Non-Player Characters and creatures suf­ fer strain, they generally apply them directly to their wound threshold (unless they are a nemesis and track strain separately). CRITICAL INJURIES A particularly dangerous type of wound is a Critical Injury. A Critical Injury is often the result of a critical hit from an attack during combat, but characters can also suffer them from exceeding their wound thresh­ old, or through other means. Each time a character suffers a Critical Injury, the player rolls d 100 on Ta­ ble 6 -1 0 : Critical Injury Result to determine the extent of the injury. The short-term effects of some injuries are tempo­ rary, and may only disorient or afflict the character for a brief amount of time.

These injuries continue to affect the character until he receives the proper medical treatment to recover from the injury. Regardless, a Critical Injury remains with the character until it is properly healed; even if the short-term effect of the Critical Injury has passed, the status of having a Critical Injury remains. Each Critical Injury a character suffers from adds + 10 to any subsequent Critical Injury check. Essentially. Critical Injury is cumulative, and left untreated, even a number of relatively minor Critical In­ juries can lead to devastating results. OTHER ONGOING STATUS EFFECTS Characters in Edge of the Empire can suffer status ef­ fects beyond being wounded or incapacitated. These status effects can change what a character can do during an encounter, and can be very dangerous. Al­ ternatively, inflicting them on others can be a very po­ tent ability indeed. STAGGERED A staggered character cannot perform actions (in­ cluding downgrading actions to maneuvers). Most effects that stagger a character last for a set du­ ration. If a set duration is not specified, the stag­ gered effect lasts until the end of the character’s next turn. If a character is staggered m ultiple times, each instance increases the total duration of the ef­ fect by the instance's specified duration, but may not increase the total duration beyond the scope of the present encounter. IMMOBILIZED An immobilized character cannot perform maneuvers (including maneuvers purchased via strain or spend­ ing O ) Most effects that immobilize a character last for a set duration. If a set duration is not specified, immobilization lasts until the end of the character’s next turn. If a character is immobilized multiple times, each instance increases the total duration of the ef­ fect by the instance’s specified duration, but may not increase the total duration beyond the scope of the present encounter. STRAIN DAMAGE AND CRITICAL HITS n lthough not always likely, some attacks that deal strain damage (notably stun weapons) can also trigger critical hits. Although this may seem odd, it actually makes sense. When a Play­ er Character inflicts a critical hit on an adversary that can be incapacitated by a single critical hit (such as a minion), then they are simply inca­ pacitated by being rendered unconscious. If PCs or nemesis NPCs suffer a critical hit from a stun weapon, this may be anything from ad­ verse long term effects from the stun weapon to tangential injuries from being stunned (the stun shot could knock them off balance, and they take a nasty crack on the skull when they hit the ground, for example). Of course, since these critical hits would have to be triggered by the players or CM, both parties can always decide that a critical hit would not make sense in that narrative, and choose not to trigger them. DISORIENTED A disoriented character adds ■ to all checks he makes. Most effects that disorient a character last for a set duration. If a set duration is not specified, disorientation lasts until the end of the character's next turn. If a character is disoriented multiple times, each instance increases the total duration of the ef­ fect by the instance’s specified duration, but may not increase the total duration beyond the scope of the present encounter. DEATH The dangerous galaxy of Edge of the Empire puts the Player Characters in treacherous situations, and even the most stalwart character cannot survive every­ thing. A time may come when a PC faces his ultimate fate and perishes. If a character ever rolls (or. through multiple or un­ treated Critical Injuries, otherwise suffers) a result of 1 41 or higher on Table 6 -1 0 : Critical Injury Result, he dies. A dead character cannot be brought back to life. Similarly, a destroyed droid character may not be restored—it is assumed that his central processing unit was irrevocably damaged. Either way. the player should move on and create a new character to con­ tinue the adventure. For more on the death of a Player Character, see Chapter IX: The Game Master RECOVERY AND HEALING W hile characters can be afflicted with various ail- ments and types of damage, there are thankfully several options for recovery. Recovery can vary in time and effectiveness, based on the resources and expertise available to the characters. With the proper resources and sufficient time, characters can recover from virtually any encounter. RECOVERING FROM WOUNDS There are several ways that characters can recover from wounds. Some allow for natural, if slow, healing and oth­ ers require access to high-tech medical facilities. NATURAL REST For each full night’s rest, the character recovers one wound, regardless of the character’s cur­ rent state of health. At the end of each full | week of rest, the character may attempt a Resilience check to recover from one Critical Injury. The difficulty is equal to the Critical Injury’s severity rating. On a successful check, the character recov­ ers from the Critical Injury and is no longer affected. On a failed check, the character retains the Critical Injury ef­ fect, but still recovers one wound. A (& result means the character can heal one additional Critical Injury. Droids benefit from natural rest like any other character, as their subroutines and automated systems attempt self-repairs. MEDICAL CARE A character may attem pt a Medicine check to help a character heal wounds. Each character may only receive one Medicine check each encounter, as there is only so much good first aid can do to help a character. The difficulty of the check is based on the target’s current state of health. On a successful check, the target recovers a number of wounds equal to the number of successes generated by the Medicine roll, and an amount of strain equal to the number of O generated. A character may also attempt to help someone re­ cover from a Critical Injury by making a Medicine check with a difficulty equal to the severity rating of the Critical Injury (see Table 6-11 on page 220). A character may attempt one Medicine check per week per Critical Injury. A character may attem pt to heal his own normal wounds or recover from his own Critical Injuries with Medicine, but increases the difficulty of the Medi­ cine check by two. In addition, attem pting a Medi­ cine check without the proper equipment (see page 176) increases the difficulty of the check by one. TABLE 6-11: MEDICAL CHECK DIFFICULTY State of Health Medicine Check Current wounds equal half or less of wound threshold Easy (4) Current wounds equal more than half of wound threshold Average ( + + ) Current wounds exceed wound threshold Hard ( + + + ) Recover Critical Injury Critical Injury Severity Rating Droids cannot benefit from medical care. However, they do receive the same benefits from Mechanics checks based on the same guidelines and difficulty ratings as their Medicine-based equivalents. All of the guidelines and rules governing Medicine checks also govern Mechanics checks to heal droids, with the ex­ ception that a droid using Mechanics to heal himself only increases the difficulty by one, rather than two. Simply put, most droids can avoid feeling "pain" and have the self-diagnostic routines and programming to better understand how to repair themselves. BACTA TANKS Characters can also recover using a bacta tank. The rate of recovery depends on the character’s state of health. A wounded character recovers at a rate of one wound per two hours. An incapacitated character re­ covers at a rate of one wound per six hours. At the end of each 24-hour period, the character may attempt one Resilience check to remove one Critical Injury. The difficulty is equal to the Critical In­ jury’s severity rating. On a successful check, the char­ acter recovers from the Critical Injury and is no longer affected. On a failed check, the character retains the Critical Injury effect, but still recovers one wound. OIL BATHS (DROIDS ONLY) Droids cannot benefit from a bacta tank. However, droids can benefit from an oil bath. An oil bath is spe­ cifically designed to help droids recover from damage and ill-effects. Every hour spent in an oil bath reduces one wound as the lubricant helps facilitate the droid’s self-diagnostic systems. Oil baths do not restore Critical Injuries, which are instead done with Mechanics checks. STIM PACKS Stimpacks are auto-injection tubes filled with medi­ cine, bacta, and painkillers. They are field-ready emergency health recovery products. Stimpacks heal a fixed amount with no roll necessary. However, the drawback is that stimpacks offer diminishing returns over the course of a day. Characters must spend a full night’s rest or wait at least 24 hours before stimpacks can be used at their full effectiveness aeain. The first stimpack used on a character automati­ cally recovers five wounds. The second stimpack only recovers four wounds, the third stimpack recovers three wounds, and so on. This means that a sixth st­ impack will have no effect, as the target’s body is too over-saturated with the medicine to be effective. It requires one maneuver to inject a stimpack. The character administering the stimpack must be en­ gaged with the target to treat them. A character with a free appendage may apply a stimpack to himself with one maneuver as well. For Critical Injuries, a successful Medicine check is required, based on the injury’s severity. Stimpacks have no effect on Critical Injuries. EMERGENCY REPAIR PATCHES (DROIDS ONLY) Droids cannot use stimpacks. However, they benefit from repair patches in a similar fashion as stimpacks, including the limit of five per day. However, emergen­ cy repair patches only heal three wounds per use (al­ though their viability does not reduce over time). Fixing a droid’s Critical Injuries requires Mechanics checks with a difficulty set by the Critical Injury’s severity rating. RECOVERING FROM STRAIN Fortunately, recovering from strain is fairly easy. Tak­ ing a moment to catch his breath, eating a good meal, or spending time relaxing with friends are all ways a Player Character might recover from strain. At the end of an encoun­ ter, each player can make a Simple (-) Discipline or Cool check Each Success recovers one strain. Fur­ thermore, a good night’s rest generally removes all strain a character has suffered. It is also ru­ mored that some Jedi have mastered a tech- nique that allows them to ignore the effects of strain, or ease the minds of others to help them recover more quickly. RECOVERING FROM CRITICAL INJURIES Since lingering Critical Injuries make subsequent inju­ ry more and more dangerous, they should be treated as quickly and efficiently as possible. Critical Injuries vary in magnitude, which represents the difficulty of any corresponding Medicine check to treat and re­ move the injury. It is important to note that even if the effect of a Critical Injury has expired, the Critical Injury still per­ sists until treated. For example, with a Critical result of “23," which indicates the Off-Balance Critical Injury, the character adds ■ to his next skill check. Even after this effect has been applied, the Off- Balance Critical Injury still exists, and will linger un­ til treated, making subsequent Critical Injury rolls against the character that much more dangerous. STARSHIPS AND VEHICLES I n Star Wars, agile landspeeders choke the streets of massive planet-sized cities, suspended a meter from the surface by antigravity repulsorlift generators. Grace­ ful airspeeders patrol the skies of a thousand worlds, their powerful ion engines propelling them to breath­ taking velocities. Starships great and small-rocket into space from backwater starports and hurtle through hy­ perspace, making a trip of thousands of light years with little more effort, or fanfare, than traveling to market. The universe presented in Edge of the Empire is one so reliant on such transportation technologies as to be in­ separable from them. Vehicles take on almost talismanic importance to their captains and crews, treated as living things by those who love them. Some are the only home that spacers have. Presented in this chapter are a num­ ber of the more common types of starships and vehicles found in the galaxy, and the rules governing them. VEHICLE CHARACTERISTICS From the tiniest, fastest swoop bike to a massive and lumbering Imperial-class Star Destroyer, all ships and ve­ hicles share a number of characteristics. These charac­ teristics define such attributes as the strength of a ship's shields or how quickly a speeder accelerates off the line. These characteristics cover the bulk of important' me­ chanical information about starships and vehicles. Handling: The measure of a ship or vehicle’s agility and how well it responds to its pilot. Speed: A ship or vehicle’s raw speed and how quickly it accelerates. Silhouette: An abstract of the general size of a vehicle. Defense: A ship’s first line Of defense against attack and accident. Typically representative of a ship’s ray and particle shields, defense also represents any fac­ tors, technological or otherwise, that prevent damage from reaching a vehicle’s armor. Armor: The measure of a ship or vehicle’s armor, similar to soak on the personal scale. Hull Trauma Threshold: A reflection of the sturdi­ ness of a ship or vehicle’s construction, and its ability to sustain damage and keep operating. "She may not look like much, but she’s got it where it counts." -Han Solo System Strain Threshold: The limit to which a ship or vehicle can be pushed or knocked about before important systems overload or shut down. Customization Hard Points: The number of spots avail­ able on a ship or vehicle for customization and upgrade. HANDLING Generally speaking, handling reflects a ship or vehicle’s inherent agility and the ways in which it responds to its pilot and crew. Handling is dictated by a number of factors. While size is certainly the most obvious—a Z-95 Headhunter or Firespray Patrol Boat is, by nature, more maneuverable than a Victory-class Star Destroyer —other factors such as shape, control systems, mass, or just general awkwardness all contribute to handling. In game terms, a ship or vehicle’s handling char­ acteristic dictates the number of □ or H it adds to a player’s dice pool. Baseline handling is 0, with ex­ tremely agile ships adding □ and slow or plodding ships adding ■ to all Piloting checks. Pilots add ■ equal to a ship’s negative handling value or □ equal to a ship or vehicle’s positive handling value. SPEED An abstraction of both speed and acceleration, a ship or vehicle’s speed characteristic dictates how fast an object moves relative to its environment and what ma­ neuvers are available to the pilot. The listed speed is a '‘maximum” value the ship or vehicle can travel. A pilot can always choose to go slower than his maximum speed. Speed 0 indicates a stationary ship or vehicle, with higher values indicating an increased speed ac­ cordingly (speed 1 , for example, might be a slow mov­ ing AT-AT walker or ponderous transport ship, while speed 5 might be a nimble TIE fighter or cloud car). SILHOUETTE Much like the speed characteristic, silhouette is an abstract number used to describe a ship or vehicle’s size and mass relative to other ships and vehicles. Silhouette factors heavily into scale, and is used to calculate the difficulty of attacking targets of different sizes. Generally, large ships are easy to hit, and small ships are hard to hit. Some specialized ships, such as the Lancer-class Anti-Starfighter Frigate, are excep­ tions to this rule as they are large ships fitted with smaller, lighter guns than their size and class would suggest, thereby filling specific roles within fleets. Silhouettes range from 0 to 10. Silhouette 0 is some­ thing smaller than a human (such as a specific starship component, a Jawa, or an astromech droid) and silhou­ ette 1 is something the size of an adult human. Most starfighters and light freighters range from silhouette 3 to 4. Silhouette 10 is reserved for the very largest of space stations or starships, such as the Death Star. HULL TRAUMA THRESHOLD Hull trauma threshold is a reflection of a ship or vehicle’s sturdiness and resistance to damage. The strength of a capital ship’s keel, the sturdiness of a speeder truck’s STARSHIPS, VEHICLES, AND SCALE S tarships and vehicles follow the same basic rules for interaction and operation as outlined in Chapter I: Playing the Game and Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat. However, due to their increased size and mass, starships and vehicles necessarily operate on a different scale, referred to as the planetary scale. When dealing with a vessel’s weapons, armor, and hull trauma threshold, every point is equal to ten points of the equivalent characteristic in the per­ sonal scale. For example, a laser cannon mounted to a starfighter with a base damage of three deals three points of damage when fired at another spacecraft, but thirty points of damage when fired at a human. Conversely, a man-sized blaster rifle would need to deal ten points of damage to a star- ship to inflict even one point of damage to it. Note that planetary scale weapons deal massive amounts of damage to individuals. Most hits au­ tomatically deal enough wounds to far exceed a character’s wound threshold, meaning the target will automatically be incapacitated for the remain­ der of the encounter. However, some GMs may feel this is insufficient to represent the fearsome power of a starship weapon when turned on an in­ dividual. In these cases, the GM should feel free to add + 5 0 to the resulting Critical Injury roll. (Also, those ''hit" by a planetary scale weapon might be on the periphery of the blast zone, explaining why they survived somewhat unscathed.) Also note that to avoid weapons such as blaster pistols dealing Critical Hits to heavily armored starships, the damage must exceed a starship’s armor before the shot can inflict a Critical Hit. Planetary scale weapons that have the Blast qual­ ity are particularly effective at decimating ground targets, even if their explosive radius does not al­ low them to hit multiple targets in space. Starship blast weapons hit their primary target and every additional target within short range, instead of just every target engaged with the original target. STARSHIPS AND PERSONAL SCALE J ust because starships and vehicles generally operate in planetary scale, this does not mean the GM cannot have them operate in personal scale. Two vehicles that are at close range to each other can also be at medium range in perj sonal scale, or even engaged with each other (two speeders pulled up next to each other is a perfect example). The important thing to re­ member is that all of the personal range bands exist within the close range band for planetary scale. This can also be one of the rare cases where it makes narrative sense that a starship weapon with Blast such as proton torpedo would hit multiple vehicles at once. chassis, or the general spaceworthiness of a starfighter’s spaceframe are all measured by hull trauma thresh­ old. Like the wound threshold of a Player Character, hull trauma threshold represents the amount of physi­ cal damage that a ship or vehicle can suffer before it is either crippled or destroyed. Hull trauma threshold is measured in planetary scale, meaning that one point of hull trauma equals ten wounds on an individual. SYSTEM STRAIN THRESHOLD System strain threshold represents how well a ship or vehicle’s internal systems handle the workaday abuse heaped on them by their owners and the galaxy at large. It is an aggregate of the efficiency and status of com­ puter and navigation systems, engines and hyperspace drives, power generators, and a host of other delicate systems necessary to ensure peak performance. Once a ship or vehicle suffers strain exceeding its system strain characteristic, its systems begin overloading and shutting down until they can be repaired or rebooted. This negatively affects a vehicle’s performance and can even temporarily cripple it on occasion, causing larger complications for its crew and passengers. The factors that can cause a ship or vehicle to suffer strain are numerous and varied. Most commonly, a vehicle suffers strain due to the actions of its crew as they push it to (or beyond) its breaking point. Pushing sublight engines past their safe operating limits while outrunning a pursuer or firing weapons until their bar­ rels glow are prime examples of this kind of strain. Ve­ hicles also suffer strain due to freak accidents caused by excess <§>, environmental hazards like rogue aster­ oids or ionized nebulae, or the effects of special weap­ ons such as ion cannons. One difference between system strain and regular strain is that system strain cannot be recovered by spending O - It can only be restored through actions taken by the crew, or it recovers one system strain for ev­ ery full day spent without suffering more system strain. CUSTOMIZATION HARD POINTS Every starship and vehicle produced in the galaxy is customizable to some degree. While many, like starfighters and most military vessels, are built for specific purposes and have very little room for modi­ fication, other civilian and commercial ships and ve­ hicles are designed to be modular for ease of person­ alization and customization. The majority of freighters and transports fall squarely into this latter group, with highly modular hulls that can be configured in myriad ways to carry any kind of cargo imaginable. To this end, all ships and vehicles have a number of customization hard points that can be used to tweak a vehicle’s performance, characteristics, or armament to suit the needs of its owners. The number of customization hard points a ship or vehicle possesses is determined more by its make and model than by its size. A Firespray-class patrol boat is relatively small yet easy to customize due to its construction, while a massive, kilometer-long Im­ perial ILclass Star Destroyer has little to no custom­ ization potential despite its size, due to the special­ ized nature of its mission and design. PROTECTION To protect their passengers, crews, and precious car­ gos, ships and vehicles in the Star Wars galaxy use a number of methods to avoid or deflect damage. In general terms, a ship or vehicle’s protection is an ATMOSPHERIC AND SUBLIGHT SPEED N ot all speeds are created equal in Edge of the Empire. Speeds in atmosphere or on a plan­ et’s surface are necessarily slower than equiva­ lent speeds in space, where there is no friction or gravity working against a vessel’s drives and limiting its speed. For example, an airspeeder with a speed of 4 traveling in atmosphere is slower than a starship with a speed of 4 traveling through space. In addition, starships with transat- mospheric capabilities (typically anything of sil­ houette 5 or smaller) move at drastically lower speeds in atmosphere, even though their speed ratings stay the same. For example, a starfighter moving at speed 5 in atmosphere is moving slow­ er than if it were traveling at speed 5 in space. This is due to the fact that, while they can oper­ ate in atmosphere, most starships are not opti­ mized for it. Instead of having aerodynamic hulls and wings with variable control surfaces, they have to force their way through atmosphere us­ ing their ion drives and repulsorlift generators. amalgam of its maneuverability, the durability of its hull or chassis, the strength of its shields, and the thickness of its armor. Some ships have obscure types of protection such as focused gravity waves, clusters of point defense laser cannons, or launchers full of micro-missiles used to intercept incoming starfighters, shuttles, and ordnance. Whatever form these protec­ tions take, Edge of the Empire divides them into two discrete statistics: defense and armor. DEFENSE Defense reflects a ship or vehicle’s ability to completely deflect or reduce the damage of incoming attacks or col­ lisions through use of deflector shields, point defense systems, raw speed, or other, more esoteric, technolo­ gies. This is a crucial protective system, and is the first line of defense for the majority of space-going vessels and even some ground vehicles. Defense works the same as described on page 206; each point adds ■ to any incoming attack roll made against a ship or vehicle. The amount of Y generated by the ■ added to the attack­ er’s dice pool has the potential to greatly reduce or even negate any damage from the attack or collision, and the <§> generated also lessens the chance of critical hits. SILHOUETTE A N D DEFENSE ZONES Ships (and those rare vehicles with defense) have a number of defense zones dictated by their silhouette. Anything with silhouette 4 or lower has two defense zones: forward and aft. Ships with silhouette 5 or high­ er have four defense zones: forward, aft, port, and star­ board. Every ship comes with a pre-set defense rating for each of its defense zones dictated by its computer system and the factory settings of its shield generators. The maximum amount of defense a ship or vehicle can have in any of its defense zones is four points, regard­ less of its size. For example, the sturdy BTL-A4 Y-wing attack starfighter has a silhouette of three and two de­ fense zones, forward and aft. The default setting of the Y-wing’s defense rating is one point of defense to the forward zone, and one point aft. Most types of defense, especially the common ray and particle deflector shields found on the ships of the majority of spacefaring species, can be assigned or "angled” to different zones to shore up defense where it’s needed the most. This is done by re-routing power from one zone to another, reducing the de­ fense at one part of the ship to bolster it somewhere else. In the case of the Y-wing above, if it were being pursued by a TIE fighter, the pilot could re-route pow­ er from the forward defense zone to the aft defense zone, giving the Y-wing two points of defense aft and none forward until the power is reset. The Y-wing adds ■ ■ dice to the TIE fighter’s attacks, but any attacks made against the forward defense zone suffer no ■ . Each ship and vehicle has a chart displaying its de­ fault shield settings by defense zone. For ships with silhouette 4 and lower, this is represented by two numbers, one for the forward zone and one for the aft zone. For ships of silhouette 5 or higher with multiple defense zones, this is represented by four numbers indicating the forward zone, the port zone, the star­ board zone, and the aft zone. ARMOR Armor is a starship’s second line of defense, and the only protection available to the majority of ground vehicles. It soaks up damage from attacks and impacts that are able to penetrate a ship’s defense. The more passive of the two types of protection, starship and vehicle armor is made of a number of materials from common durasteel to rare carbon composites and advanced polycarbonites. Much like personal body armor worn by Player Charac­ ters, a ship or vehicle’s armor soaks a number of damage points equal to its rating. As it is based on planetary scale, one point of a ship’s armor is equivalent to ten points of soak on a personal scale. STARSHIP AND VEHICLE WEAPONS S tarship and vehicle weapons range from the light repeating blasters found on speeder bikes to the massive turbolaser batteries on the flanks of an Imperial Star Destroyer. However, in Edge of the Em pire, every ship or vehicle-class weapon shares a number of common characteristics. These weapons are very similar to the weapons found in Chapter V, with some noted differences. • Range: This is the maximum range of the weapon. Starships and vehicles use a larger scale to measure ranges than personal scale. SHIPYARD STANDARD SYSTEMS * The number and variety of starships at large in the gal­ axy is staggering. Despite this, nearly every starship in the galaxy shares a number of common components required to travel safely among the stars. Ground ve­ hicles also share some of these systems, primarily comms and sensors. Sublight Engines: Sublight engines drive star- ships through realspace at speeds approaching that of light. They provide both transatmospheric and intra- system capabilities to ships of all sizes, from the tini­ est starfighter to the massive, kilometer-long Imperial Star Destroyers. The most common sublight engine is the ion drive, a tried-and-tested technology that uses fusion reactors with hypermatter cores to produce highly charged ions for thrust. Hyperdrive: Hyperdrives were the key technology that allowed the foundation of galactic society as it exists today. These delicate drives allow a ship to enter hyperspace, an alternate state of reality that allows travel at speeds many times that of light. Hyperdrives are rated by a class that reflects the relative superluminal speed of a drive on a descending scale, with lower numbers denoting faster drives. Givilian hyperdrives are typically between class 3 and 4, although faster drives can be obtained. Most ships are equipped with a backup hyperdrive for use should the primary hyperdrive fail. These are typically exceedingly slow and are only really useful for short-range trips. N avicomputer: Ranging from the sophisticated and powerful computer arrays used aboard military capital ships to the astrogation buffer in an R2 as- tromech droid, navicomputers are primarily used to generate the incredibly complex calculations needed to make a safe jump through hyperspace. Escape Pods/Ejection Systems: All ships, and many airspeeders, are equipped with emergency escape systems that allow a ship’s crew to evacuate the ship in case of catastrophic damage. Most airspeeders and starships up to silhouette 3 are equipped with ejection seats that blast the pilot and any crew free of the dis­ integrating ship Ejection seats are equipped with tiny maneuvering thrusters and a small repulsorlift engine designed to bring a pilot safely back to land in the case of ejection. Use of ejection seats is common in atmosphere, and many flight suits are designed to offer limited vacuum protection. Ships of silhouette 4 or larger are equipped with enough escape pods to evacuate the ship’s crew and any passengers. These escape pods are pressurized and have enough consumables to keep their occupants— typi­ cally four to six sentients— alive for five standard days. Sensors: Sensors grant a vehicle’s crew a constantly updated, 360-degree view of their immediate surround­ ings. Sensors operate at different range bands depending on their ship and relative strength, and although powerful, can be fooled or jammed altogether by numerous technol­ ogies. Sensors operate in two modes: passive and active. Sensors operating in passive mode operate at low power, and see everything around the ship up to their maximum range band. Using sensors in passive mode requires no skill check, as they are largely automatic and are relay­ ing the minimum amount of data their programming pro­ vides. Sensors operating in active mode are more power­ ful and focused, however. When operating in active mode, sensors can see one range band farther than their listed maximum range, but can only see in one of the ship's fire arcs (forward, aft, port, or starboard). Using sensors in active mode requires an Easy (<)) Surveillance check modified by any ambient radiation, atmospheric disturbances, terrain such as forests or mountains (or asteroids or nebula in space), or active jamming on the part of whatever is being scanned. Comms: Comms are shorthand for a ship or vehicle’s means of communication. Standard comms are sub­ space transceivers with a range equal to that of the vehicle’s sensors. If a ship has short-range sensors, for example, it also has short-range comms. Comms are typically unencrypted, easily intercepted, and easily jammed, although numerous modifications can be made to a ship’s comm systems to make any signals transmit­ ted or received more secure. Transponder: Every space-going vessel possesses a subspace transponder. The subspace transponder broadcasts the vessel’s registry, hull number, owner­ ship, and other pertinent information on a special fre­ quency that can be picked up by any vessel or subspace comm array at close range. The transponder also oper­ ates as a distress beacon in the event that a ship suf­ fers some kind of critical emergency. It is considered a serious crime in the Empire to tamper with a transpon­ der in any way, and evidence of an altered transponder is probable cause enough for a ship to be stopped and boarded by Imperial officers. This doesn't stop those who value their anonymity from doing so, however. • Damage: This number is the base damage the weapon inflicts with a successful attack. For every & generated during the attack, the attacker adds + I damage to the base damage. • Critical Hit Rating: This number is the amount of O required to trigger Critical Hits with the weapon. If enough O is generated and a Critical Hit is trig­ gered, the character firing the weapon rolls IdlOO on Table 7 -9 : Critical Hit Result on page 244 to determine the Critical Hit’s effect on the target. Some weapons and talents modify this Critical Hit roll, potentially making it more or less effective. In addition, a character can only generate one Critical Hit per hit on a target. However, if the roll generates enough O to result in multiple Critical Hits, the char­ acter can choose to add an additional + 10 per ad­ ditional Critical Hit to the roll result. • Fire Arc: The direction or directions a weapon can be fired, based on its mounting. Fire arcs are discussed in further detail below. • Special Qualities: Many weapons, such as ion cannons, tractor beams, and repeating blast­ ers, have additional special qualities that affect their performance. Descriptions of these special effects are found on page 1 54 of Chapter V: Gear and Equipment BLASTER CANNONS Known colloquially as "flash cannons," blaster cannons are heavy, crew-served versions of the common personal blaster. Although they are less powerful than laser can­ nons, blaster cannons are highly effective against infan­ try and light vehicles and are typically found mounted to atmospheric vehicles or smaller spaceships. Blaster cannons come in several versions of varying power. AUTO BLASTER Auto blasters are rapid-fire variants of common blast­ er cannons. Advanced XCiter technology and highly specialized actuating modules means these weapons achieve high cyclical rates of fire, spraying hails of shots with a single pull of a trigger or push of a button. ION WEAPONS Ion weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets. They use ion turbine generators to create masses of negatively charged particles which are fused with plasma and released as blasts or pulses. The nega­ tively charged particles interfere with a target’s elec­ trical systems, shorting circuits, corrupting computers, and forcing system shutdowns in an effort to subdue a target or make it easier to destroy via more traditional means. Although designed to do little-to-no physical damage to targets, collateral damage such as fried cir­ cuits, fused joints, and even fires may occur due to the intense energy surges. LASER WEAPONS These weapons use focused light beams combined with charged particles to produce long-range, accu­ rate, and incredibly damaging blasts of energy. The number one choice for anti-vehicle and anti-personnel work, laser weapons make a fine complement to the lower yield blaster. LASER CANNON The standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship. Preferred over blaster cannons for their damage and accuracy, laser cannons can be paired in batteries or mounted separately. Light and medium laser can­ nons are often found on starfighters and freighters. Heavy laser cannons are mounted to capital ships as secondary weapons to deal with smaller ships. Lasers are also often mounted to military ground vehicles. FIRE ARCS E very ship and vehicle has four fire arcs: forward, aft, port, and starboard. Each fire arc covers an area of the ship in a ninety degree arc extending from the center point of the ship. Depending on where on a ship's hull a weapon is located, and the manner in which it is mounted, a weapon can cov­ er one or multiple fire arcs. Fixed weapons cover only one fire arc. For example, the laser cannons mounted in the nose of the BTL Y-Wing are fixed forward and can only hit enemies in the forward fire arc. Turret-mounted weapons, such as the tur­ bolasers mounted to the CR90 corvette, can tra­ verse to cover any fire arc required, which is listed as “Fire Arc All" in the weapon’s description. Some ships also have Dorsal (top) and Ventral (bottom) fire arcs. Weapons mounted on a ship’s dorsal surface cannot hit ventral targets, and ventral-mounted weapons cannot engage threats approaching from the ship’s dorsal side. For ex­ ample, the ventral-mounted laser cannon on a YT- 1300 medium freighter has a ventral fire arc of All, which means it can engage any threat approach­ ing from below the ship, but must reposition itself to engage enemies coming in from above. QUAD LASER CANNON Quad lasers are dedicated anti-starfighter weapons consisting of four small-caliber laser cannons linked to a single firing mechanism and slaved to a sophisticated fire-control system. They fire four laser blasts with ev­ ery pull of the trigger, and can quite easily fill the space around a ship with enough kilojoules of energy to de­ stroy even the toughest starfighter or patrol boat. TURBOLASER Massive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible en­ ergy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weap­ ons mounted to starships. Turbolasers can punch clean through an opponent’s shields, armor, and hull with a single blast; the lightest easily hulling small ships and the heaviest battering down the defenses of the largest cruiser. The trade-offs are their heavy power require­ ments, their slow recharge time, and their difficulty in tracking and hitting small, fast targets like starfighters. TRACTOR BEAMS Tractor beams are modified shield generators that proj­ ect a beam of energy that can ensnare starships. Used on orbital shipyards, planetary starports, space stations, and many starships, tractor beams are commonly used to guide vessels safely into slips and docking bays, as well as to handle cargo. When mounted to warships, they can be used offensively to capture enemy vessels and draw them into docking bays for ease of boarding. ORDNANCE Ordnance provides vehicles and starships with a pow­ erful one-use weapon that can punch through armor or even lock on to opponents and track them. These projectiles are propelled by small sub-light drives and carry high-yield warheads designed to give small ships a heavier punch against large ships or to take out en­ emy starfighters or airspeeders before the opponent can close to engage. Most ordnance contains a so­ phisticated guidance system and vectored thrusters that allow it to track its target and even come around for another pass if it misses the first time. CONCUSSION MISSILES AND GRENADES The more common and less powerful of the two types of shipboard ordnance, concussion missiles are found on all manner of spacecraft, from tiny starfighters to capital ships. Roughly a meter long, a concussion mis­ sile employs special warheads, combining a hardened durasteel penetrator that uses kinetic force to pierce through a ship’s armor and a shaped high-explosive charge that causes damage through both explo- ^ LIMITED AMMO AND STARFIGHTERS S ometimes starfighters or other small ships have weapons such as proton torpedoes or concussion missile launchers that have the Limited Ammo Quality. Although normally Limited Ammo weapons can be reloaded with a maneuver once exhausted, starfighters gen­ erally carry only one payload of torpedoes or missiles, and must be reloaded back at a base or carrier starship. They cannot be reloaded in mid-flight, and especially not in mid-combat! sive force and concussive shock. Concussion missiles are primarily anti-fighter weapons, used to quickly deal crippling damage to starfighters and patrol boats, al­ though they perform well against larger targets as well. Concussion grenades are primarily a personal scale weapon, although many military ground vehicles mount concussion grenade launchers that fire larger anti-infantry or anti-armor versions. Concussion gre­ nade launchers are typically relatively short range bal­ listic weapons, and thus are useless in space combat. Additional concussion missiles cost 500 credits each and are Restricted. PROTON TORPEDOES Proton torpedoes are highly advanced anti-ship pro­ jectiles typically carried by starfighters and patrol boats. They are larger and bulkier than concussion missiles and have a squat, conical warhead, meaning their launchers carry fewer rounds than an equivalent concussion missile launcher. These weapons mount a deadly, irradiating, proton-scattering warhead deto­ nated by a volatile Nergon-14 explosive charge. Pro­ ton torpedoes are designed to damage and destroy large vessels like bulk transports and capital ships. They allow small ships like starfighters and patrol boats to punch well above their weight. Additional proton torpedoes cost 750 credits each and are Restricted.

Starship and vehicle combat is not intended to be a com pletely sepa­ rate rules system. Instead, it is designed to be an added layer of detail on the standard combat rules that allows players to run structured gameplay en­ counters using starships, vehicles, characters, or any com bination thereof. When running encounters using starships and vehi­ cles, it is important to note that starships with silhou­ ette 5 or higher have some different rules governing their actions. This is because these ships are quite a bit larger than starfighters and freighters, with crews of dozens or even hundreds of individuals. COMBAT OVERVIEW Starship and vehicle combat in Edge of the Empire fol­ lows the same basic order and rules as those detailed in Chapter VI: Conflict and Combat It is listed again here for ease of reference. STEP 1: DETERMINE INITIATIVE At the beginning of the first round of combat, all play­ ers and NPCs need to determine the order in which they will take their turns. This is referred to as the Initiative order To determine the Initiative order, each Player Char­ acter and NPC makes a Simple ( - ) Cool or Vigi­ lance check (for more information on which to use, see the Cool or Vigilance? sidebar on page 1 99). Once all Initiative checks have been made, the CM notes the results of each check and ranks them in order, from highest to lowest. If two checks are tied, the check with more O is ranked higher, and if they are still tied PCs are ranked higher than NPCs This is the Initiative order. STEP 2: ASSIGN INITIATIVE SLOTS Once the CM has determined the Initiative order, he notes which results were generated by Player Char­ acters, and which results were generated by NPCs. The results generated by Player Characters become Player Character Initiative slots. The results generated by NPCs become NPC Initiative slots. COMBAT AND THE PILOTING SKILL D uring combat involving Starships and Vehi­ cles, Player Characters and NPCs are often called upon to make Piloting checks to control their vehicles, take certain actions, and avoid di­ sastrous outcomes. Whenever a Piloting check is called for, the piloting character or NPC must make a check using either Piloting (Planetary) or Piloting (Space) depending on the vehicle. For the sake of brevity, the specific version of the Piloting skill is not defined and it is up to the GM to adjudicate which skill is most appropriate. Beginning at the top of the Initiative order, the players and CM fill each Initiative slot one at a time with a char­ acter turn. If the Initiative slot is a Player Character Ini­ tiative slot, then the players agree on one Player Char­ acter to fill the slot from amongst the Player Characters who have not acted that round. That Player Character then takes this turn. If the Initiative slot is an NPC Ini­ tiative slot, then the CM chooses one NPC to fill the slot from amongst the NPCs who have not acted that round. That NPC then takes this turn. Note that some starships can have multiple crew members in them. STEP 4: ROUND ENDS Once all NPCs and Player Characters have taken a turn, the round ends. At this point, any effects that last until the "end of the round” end. The GM also determines if the ongoing action warrants additional rounds, or if it has been resolved. If the ongoing action continues, repeat step three using the same Initiative order generated in step 1. If the action has been re­ solved and the encounter is over, proceed to step 5. STEP 5: ENCOUNTER ENDS Once the action has been resolved, the CM ends the en­ counter. At this point, any character abilities that can only be used "once per encounter” reset. Each Player Char­ acter also has a chance to catch his breath and recover strain, and can take steps to help heal any incapacitated characters. S T E P 3 : P A R T IC IP A N T S T A K E T U R N S Combat between small, one-person ships like starfight- ers and patrol boats or speeder bikes or single-seat airspeeders is relatively straightforward. The pilot, as the sole crew aboard, has one starship maneuver and one starship action (or two starship maneuvers) during his turn. This means he can fly and fight aboard his ship, or concentrate solely on flying. Small craft com­ bat (especially with high-speed vehicles like airspeed­ ers, speeder bikes, or starfighters) is quite abstracted. As they are constantly moving and striving with one an­ other for the upper hand (and thanks to their incredible speed and agility) it would be nearly impossible to map out every move a starfighter makes. Instead, the Came Master and players describe the actions the characters and NPC take, embellish them with narrative flair, then make their skill checks to resolve the actions. CAPITAL SHIP COMBAT Combat in larger, capital-class starships of silhouette 5 or higher is, by necessity, more abstract due to the complexity of the vessel and the number of crew mem­ bers involved. Similar to combat in small craft, capital ships can only perform one starship maneuver and one starship action (or two starship maneuvers) during their turn. This is not an inherent quality of the ship, however; it is based on the pilot or captain's actions and starship maneuvers. Along with the pilot, each ad­ ditional crew member aboard can use his actions and starship maneuvers to man weapons, operate sensors, move about the ship, and generally engage in com­ bat along with the pilot. This all happens in the same round, and is subject to Initiative order just like per­ sonal combat. Something to remember concerning ship combat with vehicles of this immense size is that each ship is likely to have hundreds or thou­ sands of crew. GMs and players should not track all of their initiative slots and actions during combat. Instead, only focus on those individuals who are actually doing things pertinent to the ongoing encounter, and feel free to ignore the rest. SMALL CRAFT COMBATCOMBAT TURNS Much like personal combat, combat between starships and vehicles in Edce of the Empire is largely an abstract, narrative-driven activity designed for quickness and ease of use. This is meant to better reflect the frenetic, cinematic, action-adventure style of Star Wars and to avoid bogging a game session down with the minutiae of charts and grid maps. This means that the maneuvers a starship performs are open to narration and the inter­ penetration of both the Came Master and the players. In Edge of the Empire, Player Characters follow the same rules of combat as detailed starting on page 197. This means they can perform one action and one maneuver during their turn. They may also be able to perform a second maneuver by either suffering strain or spending Advantage, although each player may never take more than two maneuvers during his turn. MANEUVERS Less involved than ac­ tions, maneuvers are simple activities that do not typi­ cally require a skill check. Beyond all the maneuvers in per­ sonal combat, there are sev­ eral maneuvers that apply specifically to starships and vehicles. These additional maneuvers follow the usual rules governing maneuvers (see page 200). In addition (and especially in larger starships), characters are assumed to be able to perform any personal maneuvers such as dropping prone, managing gear, or interacting with the environment (although the CM and players should use common sense as to what a character can and cannot do given the situation). This also includes maneuvers such as aiming, since a character can aim with a quad laser turret just as he can aim with a blaster rifle. In general, all the maneuvers listed starting on page 201 apply in all forms of combat (with a certain level of common sense). When ships or vehicles are in encounters, they should always track their current speed. A ship may be operating at any speed from zero to its maximum, however accelerating and decelerating takes maneu­ vers to accomplish. A starship or vehicle with silhouette 1 -4 can benefit from one Pilot Only maneuver in a round, and can ben­ efit from a second Pilot Only maneuver if it suffers two system strain (Pilot Only maneuvers are ones that af­ fect the movement of the ship itself, and ships may only move so fast and so far). If the starship has a single pilot, the pilot must suffer two strain (or downgrade his action to a maneuver) to perform two maneuvers, as per com­ bat rules. Some ships can have multiple pilots, in which case each can perform a Pilot Only maneuver and only the ship suffers the strain. However, these ships are rare. A starship or vehicle with silhouette 5 or higher can only benefit from one Pilot Only maneuver in a round. ACCELERATE/DECELERATE Pilot Only: Yes Silhouette: Any Speed: Any The pilot may increase or decrease the ship or ve­ hicle’s current speed by one, to a minimum of zero or a maximum of the ship’s maximum speed rating. FLY/DRIVE Pilot Only: Yes Silhouette: Any Speed: Any This starship maneuver reflects the simple act of mov­ ing the ship or vehicle closer or further away from something at its current speed. The number of starship maneuvers re­ quired for a ship or vehicle to move through a given number of range bands is dependent on its speed. It is important to remember that range is based on the moving ship's perspective, and is not a measure of actual physical distance. • Speed 0: The ship or ve­ hicle is not moving and can­ not use this starship maneuver until it accelerates. • Speed 1: One starship maneuver to move within close range of a target or object, or two starship maneuvers to move from close to short range or from short range to close range. • Speed 2 -4 : One starship maneuver to move within close range of a target or object, to move from close to short range, or from short to close range. Two starship maneuvers to move from close to medium, or medium to close range. • Speed 5 -6 : One starship maneuver to move within close range of a target or object, to move from close to medium range, or from medium to close range. Two starship maneuvers to move from close to long, or long to close range. EVASIVE MANEUVERS Pilot Only: Yes Silhouette: 1 -4 Speed: 3 + Evasive Maneuvers reflects a pilot’s efforts to avoid incoming fire, collision, or other calamity. Executing Evasive Maneuvers upgrades the difficulty of the dice pool once for all attacks made against the ship until the end of the pilot’s next turn. While this makes the ship executing the starship maneuver harder to hit, it also makes it harder for the ship executing the star- ship maneuver to hit anything else. Executing Evasive Maneuvers likewise upgrades the difficulty of the dice pool once for all attacks made by the ship until the end of the pilot’s next turn. Evasive Maneuvers can only be undertaken by ships or vehicles of silhouette 4 or lower. Anything larger is typically too slow or awkward to perform Evasive Maneuvers. STAY ON TARGET Pilot Only: Yes Silhouette: 1 -4 Speed: 3 + This reflects a pilot’s concentration and his ability to shut out combat-related stresses and distractions to make sure a target is hit or an adversary destroyed. Until the end of the pilot’s next turn, all combat checks from the vehicle or vessel executing this maneuver up­ grade the Ability dice in their pool once. Unfortunately, while he is concentrating so hard on his target, the pilot blocks out all other threats and is an easier target for op­ ponents. Any combat checks made targeting a ship ex­ ecuting this starship maneuver upgrades the Ability dice in their pool once until the end of the pilot’s next round. This starship maneuver is restricted to small vessels like starfighters and patrol boats, and only ships or vehicles of silhouette 4 or lower can Stay on Target. PUNCH IT Pilot Only: Yes Silhouette: 1-4 Speed: Any This maneuver allows a ship or vehicle to go immediate­ ly to its maximum speed rating from any other speed, mostly by throwing the throttles to maximum and over­ loading the ship or vehicle’s drives. While expeditious, it also puts undue strain on a ship or vehicle. When exe­ cuting this starship maneuver, the ship or vehicle suffers one point of system strain for every point of speed be­ tween the ship’s current speed and its maximum speed. For example, the pilot of a YT-1 300 light freighter is hiding from an Imperial navy patrol at speed 0 in the lee of a large asteroid. Suddenly he is set upon by a pair of TIE Fighters, decides that discretion is the better part of valor, and Punches It. He immediately throws his throttles to their maximum setting and the ship jumps to life. While he escapes unharmed and is able to jump to hyperspace, the sudden acceleration causes three points of strain to his ship. This starship maneuver is restricted to ships of silhou­ ette 4 or lower, as larger vessels have too much mass to accelerate so quickly. ANGLE DEFLECTOR SHIELDS Pilot Only: No Silhouette: Any Speed: Any Using this maneuver, a crewmember with access to the shield controls can reassign up to one point of De­ fense from one defense zone to another. For example, a player could shore up a vessel's forward defense zone with a point from its aft defense zone. This ma­ neuver only works if the ship or vehicle has defense that can be reassigned, as with deflector shields. ACTIONS In combat involving starships or vehicles, there are some additional actions characters may perform that specifically apply to the ship or vehicle they are oper­ ating. Some of these actions are labeled as Pilot Only actions. A starship or vehicle may benefit from only one Pilot Only action per round, no matter how many crew-members are aboard her. (Pilot Only actions are actions that affect the movement of the ship itself, and ships may only move so fast and so far.) Remember, any of the actions listed starting on page 203 of combat can also be performed in com­ bats involving ships or vehicles, within the bounds of common sense. DAMAGE CONTROL Pilot Only: No Silhouette: Any Speed: Any This action is an attempt to mitigate some of the stress caused to a vehicle’s systems through combat or accident. Using this action, any Player Character who makes a successful Mechanics check recovers one point of system strain. The difficulty of the Me­ chanics check is determined by the strain the ship is currently suffering. Damage Control can be attem pt­ ed as many times as needed to reduce a ship’s system strain to zero (with the caveat that a single character can still only perform one action per turn, of course). TABLE 7-2: DAMAGE CONTROL DIFFICULTY Total Strain Total Hull Trauma Difficulty System strain less than half system strain threshold. Hull trauma less than half vehicle's hull trauma threshold. . Easy (4 ) System strain equal to or more than half vehicle’s system strain threshold. Hull trauma equal to or more than half vehicle's hull trauma threshold. A verage ( 4 4 ) System strain exceeds vehicle's system strain threshold. Hull trauma exceeds vehicle's hull trauma threshold. H ard ( 4 4 4 ) Likewise, a skilled mechanic can even repair some of the damage dealt to a vehicle during an ongoing fight, although this is much trickier. In general, PCs can only attempt one Damage Control check to reduce hull trau­ ma per encounter (there are only so many repairs that can be accomplished without the facilities of a proper shipyard). In addition, the GM is the final arbitrator as to whether a Player Character can attempt repairs of hull trauma at all (a snubfighter pilot could not climb out of his cockpit during a dogfight to patch his wing, nor could a speeder biker re-attach one of his control surfaces while driving through a forest). Characters can also use this action to repair Critical Hits the ship is suffering from. The difficulty of repair­ ing a Critical Hit is listed on Table 7 -9 : Critical Hit Result. Checks to repair Critical Hits can be attem pt­ ed multiple times, until the Critical Hit is repaired. GAIN THE ADVANTAGE Pilot Only: Yes Silhouette: 1 -4 Speed: 4 + This action reflects the constant, frantic give-and-take of a dogfight between small craft like starfighters and patrol boats or high-speed vehicles such as airspeeders. It allows a pilot to gain the upper hand on a single op­ ponent so that he positions himself for a better attack during the following round. To execute this starship ac­ tion, the pilot makes a Piloting check, the difficulty of which is determined by the relative speeds of the ships or vehicles involved in the attack. These difficulties are outlined in Table 7 -3 : Speed Advantage Difficulty If the check succeeds, the pilot ignores all penalties im­ posed by his own and his opponent's use of the Evasive Maneuvers starship maneuver until the end of the fol­ lowing round. In addition, the pilot also chooses which defense zone he hits with his attack. If he fails his check, he fails to gain the advantage from the attempt and still suffers the effects of any Evasive Maneuvers. Once the advantage has been gained, on the following turn, the opponent may attempt to cancel out the ad­ vantage by using Gain the Advantage as well. This works as described earlier, but his check is one step more dif­ ficult for each time he or his opponent has successfully Gained the Advantage against the other. ADDITIONAL SHIP AND VEHICLE ACTIONS Pilot Only: No Silhouette: Any Speed: Any When aboard a vehicle in combat, those who are not pi­ loting or firing weapons may still want to contribute to the encounter. Although the number of options open to them is limited only by a player's creativity, Table 7 -7 : Additional Starship and Vehicle Actions on page 237 has a list of actions passengers can attempt dur­ ing encounters. The table lists the actions by name, the TABLE 7-3: SPEED ADVANTAGE DIFFICULTY Difference in Speed Difficulty Initiating ship is traveling at the same speed as the target ship Average ( + + ) Initiating ship's speed is one o r more higher than target ship. Easy (+) Initiating ship's speed is one lower than target ship. Hard (+ + + ) Initiating ship's speed is two o r more lower than target ship. Daunting ( + + + + ) skill required and the check’s attendant difficulty, and the results of a success (GMs should modify the difficulty of the check if they see fit, and can also keep players from using certain skills that may not make sense in a certain situation). These actions are all covered by the “Perform a Skill Check” action, and are by no means an exhaustive list. However, they do serve to provide a range of ideas. PERFORM A COMBAT CHECK WITH VEHICLE WEAPONS Pilot Only: No Silhouette: Any Speed: Any This is similar to the Perform a Combat Check action on page 204, with some minor differences as to how it is implemented because of the differences between vehicles and individuals. For this reason, the steps to perform a combat check are repeated, with the differ­ ences written in each step; instead of the differences being listed without context. Each weapon on a starship or vehicle may only be fired a maximum of once per round unless a rule spe­ cifically allows otherwise. 1. DECLARE AN ATTACK A ND SELECT TARGETS The character chooses to make an attack. He se­ lects what skill he will use to make the attack (usually the Gunnery skill, although some vehicles may have weapons on them requiring the Ranged (Heavy) skill instead). Most combat checks aboard a starship or vehicle are made using the starship or vehicle’s weap­ ons. Remember, a particular starship or vehicle weapon can only be used once per round, no mat­ ter how many characters there are aboard the ship. 2 . ASSEMBLE THE DICE POOL The character then assembles his dice pool based on the skill, its characteristic, and any applicable talents and other abilities. Certain conditions, such as the ef­ fect of a Critical Injury, a Critical Hit inflicted on the ship or vehicle, or an environmental effect, may also contribute dice to the dice pool. See page 18 for more information on building a dice pool. The difficulty of combat checks when firing from ve­ hicles or starships is based on comparing silhouettes of the firing ship and the targeted ship (even if the target of the attack is not a vehicle or starship), and is outlined in Table 7 -4 : Silhouette Comparison This reflects the fact that large ships find it difficult to hit small, fast vessels, and their bulk makes them an easy target for those same small craft. Thanks to the advanced target­ ing computers installed in most starships, the range of a shot has no bearing on the attack's difficulty; if the target is within range, a starship can hit it. The check is further affected by modifiers brought on by starship maneuvers, talents, terrain, or any other modifiers at the Came Master’s discretion. When attacking a ship of silhouette 4 or lower, the defender chooses which defense zone the attack hits. Smaller ships are more agile and constantly in motion, meaning that during combat they are constantly juk- ing, dodging, evading, and generally positioning them­ selves so that their strongest defense zone is always facing their attacker. When attacking ships of silhouette 5 or higher, the defense zone affected by the attack is determined by the position of the ships in combat. The relative position of ships in combat is determined by both the Came Master’s and the Player Characters’ ac­ tions, and is illustrated through the cinematic game- play style inherent in E d c e o f t h e E m p i r e TABLE 7-4: SILHOUETTE COMPARISON Difference in Silhouette Difficulty Firing vessel has the same silhouette as target, or the silhouette is one larger or smaller than the target. A v e r a g e ( + Firing vessel has a silhouette two or more points smaller than the target vessel. E a s y ( ♦ ) Firing vessel has a silhouette two points larger than the target ship.

F o r m i d a b l e ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) 3. POOL RESULTS A ND DEAL DAMAGE Once the player rolls the dice pool for his character, he evaluates the results. As with any skill check, the check must generate more # than T to be successful. When making a combat check, after calculating over­ all success, each remaining & adds +1 damage to a successful attack. If the attack affects multiple targets, the additional damage is added to each target. Remem­ ber, most weapons on vehicles or starships deal damage on planetary scale, meaning each point of damage is the equivalent of ten points of damage on a personal scale. 4 . RESOLVE O A ND ($ As with every skill check, O and ($) can be spent to gain incidental beneficial effects on a combat check. However, just as the rules governing encounters are somewhat more regimented than the rules governing narrative gameplay, some of the options governing the spending of O and are more clearly defined. In en­ counters, the player controlling the activated character determines how his character spends O and unless the CM has a specific reason to decide for him instead. The first way to spend O and (£> in an attack is to activate Critical Hits or active weapon qualities. As de­ scribed on page 158 and page 245, each weapon has a Critical Rating that consists of a numeric value. The user can spend that many O to inflict one Criti­ cal Hit on the target in addition to regular effects and damage. (If the target is an individual, it inflicts a Criti­ cal Injury as per page 216). For more information on starship and vehicle Critical Hits, see page 243. Re­ member, the attack must deal damage past armor to inflict a Critical Hit. Weapon qualities are special effects and abilities that apply only when using that particular weapon. They come in two forms, active and passive. Active abilities require the user to spend a certain number of O to trig­ ger them. Generally this is O O although some quali­ ties require more or less. Qualities can inflict effects on a target, which unless specified otherwise, are always in addition to other effects, Critical Hits, and damage. In addition to always counting as an additional (£) can be spent to activate these abilities as well. ($) may be spent to inflict one Critical Hit (no matter what the Criti­ cal Rating on the weapon is) on a successful attack.

REDUCE DAMAGE, APPLY TO HULL TRAUM A THRESHOLD, AND APPLY CRITICAL HITS When a ship or vehicle suffers damage, it reduces that damage by its armor (fulfilling the same purpose as soak on individuals). If any damage remains after this reduction, the vehicle suffers that much hull trauma to its hull trauma threshold. If the net result is zero or negative, the vehicle suffers no hull trauma to its hull trauma threshold. See page 242. A successful attack can also generate a Critical Hit, which is similar to a Critical Injury. This can occur be­ cause the weapon’s Critical Rating triggered or because the target accumulated hull trauma greater than its hull trauma threshold. When a Critical Hit is inflicted, the TABLE 7-7: ADDITIONAL STARSHIP AND VEHICLE ACTIONS Action Skills and Difficulty Results Plot Course Average (44) Astrogation check, Hard ( + ♦ ♦ ) Perception check The crewmember studies the terrain ahead and plots a course that should take the vehicle safely through it.

The result of the dice roll indicates which Critical Hit is applied. Some weapons and talents modify this Critical Hit roll, potentially making a Critical Hit more or less ef­ fective. In addition, the attacker can spend the Crit Rating cost multiple times on a single hit, adding + 10 to the result for each additional Critical Hit beyond the first. Note, that talents and qualities that specifi­ cally affect Critical Injuries do not effect Critical Hits (so the Vicious quality, for example, would have no effect on a ship or vehicle). VEHICLES AND MINIONS W hen using starships and vehicles in combat, a GM can still use the rules for minions to streamline and speed up encounters. With single­ pilot vehicles such as speeder bikes, airspeeders, or starfighters, this process if very similar. Simply combine two to four of the same vehicles (and piloted by the same minion NPC) into a single minion group. This group of vehicles operates as a single entity, which can narratively be de­ scribed as flying in formation, or at least a loose­ ly clustered mob. Just as with minion groups of NPCs, starship or vehicle minion groups attack once as a group (upgrading the skill check if their "group only” skills allow this), and take damage as a group. They all select the same maneuvers and move to roughly the same locations as well. Larger capital ships or heavy vehicles are gener­ ally never treated as minions—nobody wants to have to fight a minion group of two to four Star Destroyers, after all. However, they can have minion groups operating within them. A capital ship with multiple weapons should have their weapons operated by minion gunners, and gen­ erally has multiple weapons of the same type firing in the same arc. A GM can group multiple weapons of the same type and with the same firing arc on the same vehicle or ship and have them fire as a single minion group. This means all the weapons fire as one at the same target, upgrading their check if the minion gunners have Gunnery as a group skill. This speeds up the turn of capital ships (since they generally have a great deal of guns to fire), and represents the ability of capital ships to hit other vessels through sheer volume of fire. Remember, however, when using minion groups on a single capital ship or vehicle, the vehicle is still what takes damage, not the minion group. PLANETARY SCALE RANGE BANDS Like personal combat, starship and vehicle combat uti­ lizes broad and abstract range measurements referred to as planetary scale range bands. Planetary scale range bands follow the same rules as regular range bands found on page 208. The only difference is that plan­ etary scale range bands operate on a much larger scale. As stated on page 209, close range on planetary scale picks up where personal scale leaves off. How­ ever, the scale is so much bigger that a single person could never use maneuvers to move next to a target that’s “close" to him on a planetary scale—the dis­ tance may be up to several kilometers and take an hour of walking to cover. Further range bands on a planetary scale would be even more extreme. This isn’t to say that ships and vehicles (especially smaller vehicles such as landspeeders), can’t operate in standard range bands. Any ship or vehicle able to move could cover the distance measured by standard range bands quickly, and individuals would measure their range to a vehicle or ship using standard range bands. However, because ships and vehicles can cover those distances so quickly, it makes little sense for them to measure distances in such (relatively) small increments. This goes doubly true for starfighters and airspeeders, which can cover kilometers of distance in seconds. Therefore, vehicles and starships use a second set of range bands, referred to as planetary scale range bands. As mentioned previously, the shortest range band in planetary scale (“close range") encapsulates all range bands in personal scale. This means a ship or ve­ hicle able to move to a point within close range is also covering the equivalent of all five range bands worth of distance in personal scale. This also means even the shortest range starship and vehicle weapons have the range of the largest personal scale ranged weapons. CLOSE RANGE Close range in planetary scale is slightly further than extreme range in personal scale, and can cover every­ thing from a few dozen meters up to several kilome­ ters in distance between two points. This might seem like a great deal of space, but most vehicles can cover this distance in several minutes at worst, and micro­ seconds at best. On the surface of a planet, most ground vehicles engage at close range, using their larger heavy blast­ ers and laser cannons to hit targets a regular soldier would have trouble seeing, much less hitting. In the air and in space, close range is the metaphorical “knife fight” range where dogfights between snubfighters or high-performance airspeeders take place. Capital ships endeavor to stay out of close range of each other, as it is essentially point-blank for their weapon batteries. Two large warships slugging it out at close range can tear each other to bits in short order. SHORT RANGE Short range in planetary scale is anything up to roughly several dozen kilometers away. On the surface of a plan­ et, this is far enough that vehicles no longer engage each other with line-of-sight weaponry (although artillery weapons can still pound opponents with indirect fire). In space, short range is just out of dogfighting range, and beyond the range of most starfighter and patrol boat weapons. However, most self-propelled weapons can hit targets within short range, so these smaller vessels often carry concussion missiles and proton torpedoes to extend their reach. Short range is still uncomfortably close for capital ships, though not quite as brutally point-blank as close range. PLANETARY SCALE IN SPACE AND ON THE GROUND P lanetary scale range bands can represent longer or shorter distances depending on whether the encounter is taking place in space or on (or just above) a planet's surface. This is because space is a much larger environment than any ground-based environment, and with­ out air friction and terrain to hinder movement, starships can move much faster than even the fastest airspeeder. This is why each planetary scale range band talks about the distances represented in space and on the ground. MEDIUM RANGE On the surface of a planet or within a planet’s atmo­ sphere, something is within medium range if it is with­ in roughly fifty kilometers, long enough that only the most powerful artillery weapons can engage it. In space, something may be within medium range at a somewhat longer distance, up to a few hundred kilometers. This is far beyond the reach of most starfighter weapons, but at the ideal range of most of the big guns mounted on capital ships. Thus, most capital ship engagements happen at medium range, with starfighters dogfighting between them. LONG RANGE Long range on a planet’s surface can be anywhere from a hundred to two hundred kilometers away. En­ gagements never happen at this distance, with ene­ mies appearing as flickering phantoms on the screens of each sides’ scanner systems. In space, long range can be up to several thousand kilometers away. At this point, engagements between ships become rare, with only the largest capital ship weapons able to bridge the gulf. EXTREME RANGE On a planet’s surface, extreme range is the far edge of a vehicle’s scanners, far enough that weapons cannot hope to reach. In space, extreme range is likewise beyond the range of almost all starship weapons, even those mounted on capital ships. At extreme range, opposing ships are still jockeying for position before engaging each other, and both sides still have the chance to break off and escape. STELLAR PHENOMENA OR TERRAIN S pace is full of obstacles, from simple asteroids and fiery comets to strange gravitational anomalies and nebulae and even dreaded black holes. When a ship passes near or through one of these treacherous ob­ stacles, the pilot might need to make an appropriate Piloting check, even if he is attempting a starship ma­ neuver that typically wouldn’t require one. This starship maneuver’s difficulty is based on the ship’s speed (as it is generally easier to avoid an obstacle while traveling at a reduced speed) and silhouette (as it is usually easier to dodge something in a smaller ship than in a larger one). These rules also apply to vehicles driving on the surface of a planet or flying in a planet’s atmosphere. The basic concepts are the same: smaller, more agile vehicles are more likely to avoid a fatal collision with the local terrain than slower-moving vehicles. When making the Piloting check, the difficulty is equal to the vehicle or starship’s current speed or half of its silhouette (rounding up), whichever is higher. The lower of the two values indicates how many times the difficulty of the check is upgraded. So a TIE fighter flying through an asteroid field at top speed (speed 5) would make a Piloting check with a Formidable ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) difficulty He would then take half his silhouette (base of 3, divided in half rounding up to two) and upgrade the difficulty of the check by that value. In the end, the poor TIE pilot has to make a check against ♦ ♦ ♦ and # # However, a Jawa sandcrawler with a speed of 1 and silhouette of 4 driving through a canyon would only be an Average difficulty check, with one die upgraded to a # In this case, the slow speed of the sandcrawler works to the Jawa pilot’s advantage, even if the vehicle is fairly large and unwieldy. Failing these checks does not mean the ship or vehicle crashes (although failing and generating ^ might well result in a crash). Instead, it means that the pilot has been unsuccessful in navigating through the situation. He drops his speed by one, and does not reach wherever he was attempting to go (if he was trying to reach a specific location at medium range from him, for example, he remains at medium range from the location). NAVIGATION HAZARDS While even the tiniest speck of debris can pose a threat to a starship hurtling through the void, not all astronomical features are created equal. Piloting a ship through a well-charted nebula is one thing, but threading a ship through a densely packed asteroid field while being chased by Imperial fighters is en­ tirely another. If local space is hazardous enough, the Came Master can add Setback dice to a player’s Piloting check. CELESTIAL HAZARDS AND DIFFICULT MANEUVERS Ship captains or vehicle drivers might find themselves in situations where they are already in the thick of an asteroid field or nebula (or a swamp or scree-covered hillside) and need to perform an action that requires a Piloting check. In this case, the player makes his Pilot­ ing check as specified in the description of the action (not the check specified by his speed and silhouette). He does, however, add the specified number of ■ dic­ tated by the difficulty of the obstacles; see Table 7-8: Navigation Hazard Setback Dice for reference. The Game Master can also choose to upgrade the diffi­ culty of the check based on the speed of the vehicle or ship. In general, he should upgrade the difficulty once if the speed is 1 -3, and twice if the speed is 4-6.

THE CHASE T here are some cases in starship or vehicular combat when two or more characters want to enact a chase. In this case, the standard rules for combat can be modified slightly to represent this. The most important thing to remember in a chase is that a great deal of the action is going to be narrative in nature. Skill checks can and will resolve the outcome of the chase, but the action during the chase is mostly narrative, and there­ fore up to the CM and players to describe. To resolve a chase, the CM first should determine how far away the two vehicles start from each other. If the chase consists of two ground vehicles such as speeder bikes or landspeeders, the CM may want to use personal scale range bands. If, on the other hand, the chase consists of two air- speeders. starfighters, or even capital ships, he should probably use planetary scale range bands. Once he's determined starling distance, the chased and the pursuer should make a competi­ tive Pilot check, with the type of Pilot check being dependent on the vehicles being used. The diffi­ culty of the check depends on the circumstances of the chase. A pursuit through clear space with no terrain could be a Simple (-) check Con­ versely. if the terrain is actually a factor, then the difficulty should be set using the rules found on page 240, which means pilots will likely need to balance their need for speed with the dangers of running into possibly fatal obstacles. Once both parties have made their check, com­ pare total successes (as with every competitive check). If the pursuer wins, he closes the distance between him and his prey by one range band. If the chased wins, he opens the distance between him and his pursuer by one range band. In ad­ dition, if the winner is traveling faster than the loser, he opens or closes the distance by an ad­ ditional number of range bands equal to the dif­ ference in relative speeds. It is up to the CM at what point the chase resolves, but in general, it should end if the pursuer is able to close the gap so that he is engaged (or at close range) with his prey, or if the chased is able to open the distance to beyond extreme range. If the chase is taking place as part of a larger en­ counter (such as two characters on speeder bikes chasing each other while the rest of the group fights a larger battle), then the CM should have the parties involved at the chase make their competi­ tive check at the beginning of the round, before anyone takes their turn. Then all characters take their turns as normal, with those involved in the chase having a turn to boost their speed, attack the person they're pursuing, or even try to make emergency repairs while they continue their pur­ suit (however, they cannot use their turn to take maneuvers that would move their position relative to the other members of the chase until the chase is over). It’s important to note that the position of those involved with a chase is likely changing rela­ tive to the rest of the party, and it's up to the GM and players as to where they go. Remember, the chase rules represent how far away the members of a chase are from each other, not where they actually go in a location. This part is the narrative aspect of a chase discussed previously. Finally, it’s important to note that these rules can also be used to play out a foot chase, with the only differences being that the difficulty of the chase would be a set difficulty, the speed of all participants would be equal, and the competitive check would probably be Athletics. TAKING DAMAGE A s is the case with Player Characters in personal combat, there are two types of damage ships and vehicles suffer in Edge of the Em pir e: system strain and hull damage. System strain is similar to the strain suffered by Player Characters, and reflects light, tem­ porary damage caused by glancing blows or pushing a vessel to the limits of its capabilities. Hull damage is more serious and, consequently, more life-threaten­ ing. This is actual, physical damage that makes its way past the ship’s defenses and becomes hull trauma. Hull trauma is permanent until repaired. HULL TRAUMA A ship’s hull trauma threshold is a measure of a ship or vehicle’s sturdiness and build quality. When a ship suf­ fers damage in excess of its armor, the excess converts into hull trauma. When hull trauma exceeds a ship or vehicle’s hull trauma threshold, one of two things happens. For vehicles silhouette 3 or smaller and of no particular importance (a common TIE fighter or a landspeeder full of faceless thugs for example), it sim­ ply explodes, killing the pilot and any passengers. Al­ ternately, at the Came Master’s discretion, the vehicle could simply be disabled. For larger vehicles such as stock light freighters or anything silhouette 4 or larger COLLISIONS T here are occasions when vehicles or starships will run into the terrain around them, or into another nearby vehicle or starship. In this case, there are two possible collisions: glancing blows (minor collisions) or head-on hits (major colli­ sions). These collisions can be mitigated by a ship’s defenses; particle shields in particular are specifically designed to absorb impacts. In the case of a minor collision, all vehicles or starships involved suffer a single Critical Hit. Subtract the ship's defense times ten from the roll; if the result is zero, the ship’s shields or other defenses have nullified the collision en­ tirely and the Critical Hit is canceled. In the case of a major collision, all vehicles or star- ships involved suffer a single Critical Hit as well. However, only subtract the ship's defense mul­ tiplied by five from the roll. If there are multiple defense values on multiple facings of the ship, the GM chooses which facing is hit, based on what the ship or vehicle was doing at the time. At the GM’s discretion, some particularly large ve­ hicles and vessels might be able to ignore collisions with very small vehicles or vessels. However, larger ships and vehicles have a harder time avoiding col­ lisions with larger asteroids or terrain features. (or a smaller ship such as a starfighter or a landspeeder with a player character inside it), the vehicle immedi­ ately suffers a Critical Hit from Table 7 -9 : Critical Hit Result on page 244. Additionally, the ship’s systems shut down, it reverts to emergency power, its sublight drives sputter out, and the ship is adrift. At this point, the ship is a near lifeless hulk, effectively out of com­ bat, and is likely being evacuated. If the pilot or crew of a crippled ship with hull trau­ ma that exceeds its hull trauma threshold is particu­ larly desperate or foolish, they may attem pt some temporary repairs to either escape or re-join the fray. By scavenging parts from ruined systems, raid­ ing the hold for any spares, and bypassing damaged components, along with a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Mechan­ ics check, the crew can bring the ship back to some semblance of life. The ship reduces its hull trauma to one below its hull trauma threshold but suffers the following penalties: speed is reduced to 1, Ma­ neuverability is reduced to - 3 , and all weapon sys­ tems are inoperable until fully repaired. If the ship re-enters combat in this fragile state, any attack that inflicts hull trauma immediately generates a Critical Hit with + 30 added to the roll on Table 7 - 9 : Criti­ cal Hit Result All of these effects persist until the ship can be dry-docked and repaired. SYSTEM STRAIN System strain works the same way as strain suffered by characters. A vehicle that suffers strain in excess of its system strain threshold quickly finds itself in an un­ tenable situation. Generators overload, reactors shut down, shields fall, engines go dead, electrical fires start, and all manner of electrical mayhem occurs as one by one, essential systems go offline and the ship becomes unresponsive. Until the crew can make repairs, the ship becomes helpless, adrift in space or hurtling along a course from which it can neither deviate nor escape. In game terms, when a ship or vehicle exceeds its system strain threshold, the ship's speed drops to 0 during the following round. The majority of its systems (such as engines, weapons, and shields) cease operat­ ing as well. This means it cannot move, its weapons cannot shoot, and its defense drops to 0. This might be a relatively minor situation if this is a ship flying through deep space or a vehicle safely sitting on the ground—or a more dangerous situation if the ship was flying near something with a gravitational pull. While the situation aboard a ship that has exceeded its system strain threshold is indeed dire, not all is lost. Any crew member can aid the ship in recover­ ing strain by performing repairs and damage control such as rebooting systems, bypassing fried circuits, and putting out electrical fires. This is accomplished through the Damage Control action. Ships and vehicles do recover from system strain slowly over time. For every full day a ship or vehicle spends without taking more system strain, it reduces its total system strain by one. CRITICAL HITS Occasionally a lucky, well-placed shot or collision with a particularly large or dangerous object does more to a ship than bounce harmlessly off the shields or scuff up the armor. Ion cannon blasts can short out systems, searing laser beams can pierce shields, ar­ more, and hull alike to incinerate crew alive, and rogue asteroids can tear a ship’s innards out, leaving her powerless and adrift in the cold dark of deep space. These rare occurrences are reflected by the results of Table 7 -9 : Critical Hit Result A number of factors can lead to a ship suffering a Critical Hit. For example, it might suffer enough hull trauma to exceed its hull trauma threshold, or a successful combat check could generate enough O or to trigger a weapon's criti­ cal rating. Remember, an attack’s damage also has to exceed a target’s armor to deal a Critical Hit, which is important when firing small arms at something using ar­ more instead of soak. When an attacker generates a Criti­ cal Hit, he rolls on Table 7 -9 : Critical Hit Result and his target suffers the listed effects. Critical Hits are di­ vided into four color-coded severity levels, which dictate the difficulty of the check required to repair the Critical Hit, as listed in the table. These difficulties can be further modified at the GM’s discretion. Once a ship or vehicle suffers a Critical Hit, it counts as suffering that Critical Hit until it is repaired. This status counts even if the effects of the Critical Hit only last a single round. While a ship or vehicle is suffer­ ing the effects of a Critical Hit, any additional Critical Hits generated against it add + 10 to the roll on Table 7 -9 : Critical Hit Result per existing Critical Hit. COMPONENT CRITICALS Of all the Critical Hit results, these have the potential to be the most devastating (outside of those that com­ pletely destroy a vessel). Component Hit Criticals func­ tionally disable, either temporarily or permanently, criti­ cal systems on a target vessel and can lead to a number of complications. There are two charts for Component Hit Criticals, one for small ships of silhouette 4 or lower, and one for large ships of silhouette 5 or higher. The ef­ fects of most of these Critical Hits stack, and a ship can suffer more than one Component Hit Critical. REPAIRING HULL TRAUMA While system strain and the results of many Critical Hits are temporary, hull trauma is more permanent. Repair­ ing hull trauma requires three things—proper facilities, TABLE 7-9: CRITICAL HIT RESULT d100 Severity Result 1 - 9 Easy (♦) Mechanical Stress: The ship or vehicle suffers one po in t o f system strain 1 0 -1 8 Easy (+) Jostled: A small explosion or im pact rocks the vehicle All crew members suffer one strain and are disoriented for one round. 1 9 -2 7 Easy (4 ) Losing Power to Shields: Decrease defense in affected defense zone by one until the Critical Hit is repaired.

For ships and vehicles o f silhouette 4 and smaller, the entire ship depressurizes in a num ber o f rounds equal to the ship's silhouette. Ships and vehicles o f silhouette 5 and larger tend to be highly com partmentalized and have many safeguards against depressurization. These ships d o n 't com pletely depressurize, but parts do (the specifics o f which parts depressurize is up to the CM; however each section o f the ship or vehicle th a t does lose air does so in a num ber o f rounds equal to the vehicle's silhouette). Vehicles and ships operating in an atm osphere can be tter handle this Critical Hit. However, the huge tear still inflicts penalties, causing the vehicle to suffer the Destabilized Critical Hit instead. 1 3 4 -1 3 8 Daunting (♦♦♦♦) Destabilized: The ship o r vehicle's structural integrity is seriously damaged. Reduce the ship o r vehicle’s hull trauma threshold and system strain threshold to half th e ir original values until repaired 1 3 9 -1 4 4 Daunting Fire!: Fire rages through the ship. The ship o r vehicle im m ediately takes tw o points o f system strain, and anyone caught in the fire takes damage as discussed on page 2 1 4 A fire can be p u t o u t with some quick thinking and appropriate skill. Vigilance and/or Cool checks a t the Game M aster’s discretion Once going, a fire takes one round per tw o o f the ship's silhouette points to put out. 1 4 5 -1 5 3 Daunting (♦♦♦♦) Breaking Up: The vehicle o r ship has suffered so much damage that it begins to come apart a t its seams, breaking up and disintegrating around the crew. A t the end o f the following round, the ship is com pletely destroyed and the surrounding environm ent is littered w ith debris. Anyone aboard the ship o r vehicle has one round to get to an escape pod, bail out, o r dive for the nearest hatch before they are lost. 154 + - Vaporized: The ship o r vehicle is com pletely destroyed, consumed in a particularly large and dramatic fireball. N othing survives. money, and time—the latter two usually in abundance. Proper facilities have enough tools, light, parts, and workspace to make the repairs to the vehicle. This could be anything from an orbital space station or groundside spaceport (in the case of a starship), or simply a well- stocked garage (in the case of a walker or landspeeder). Once a ship is in a slip or dry dock for repairs, each point of hull trauma restored costs roughly 500 credits. This cost is highly variable, however, and can fluctuate dramatically based on the Player Charac­ ters' reputation, the overall damage to the ship, the scarcity of parts, or countless other factors. The final cost for repairs, like many other aspects of Edge of the Em pire, is left to the Came Master’s discretion. The time required is also variable, and is left to the Came Master’s discretion. A good rule of thumb is that light damage (up to a quarter of a ship’s total hull threshold) should take an amount of time measured in days, while any damage over that takes weeks or even months to repair depending on the severity of the damage. If it proves imprudent or impossible to get to a proper maintenance facil­ ity, the GM might choose to allow the PCs to repair their vehicle using scavenged parts and their own ingenu­ ity. However, these repairs should be somewhat inferior I to the real thing, hard to per- j form (requiring several Hard 1 or Daunting Mechanics checks) and time-consuming. In short, they should be an arduous plot ■* point for the PCs to overcome, not a cheapskate way to avoid getting work done at proper facilities.

Landing Bay One of the vessel's landing bays is knocked out of commission The severity of the damage is ultimately left to the Came Master's discretion, and could result in anything from a temporary inability to launch o r recover ships from this bay, to a failure of the docking bay shield and a total decompression of the entire compartment Cargo Hold The ship is hulled and one o f the cargo holds is exposed to vacuum. Cargo may be damaged o r lost, and anyone in the cargo hold takes damage according to the Came M aster’s discretion Bridge The bridge is damaged. No starship maneuvers o r starship actions may be executed aboard the ship until the damage is repaired In addition, the ship continues on its course at its current speed, and cannot be stopped or its course changed until the damage is fixed INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL D espite the fact that the advent of the galaxy-shrink­ ing hyperdrive has made travel between stars commonplace, the galaxy is still largely an unimag­ inably vast, empty void dotted here and there with tiny islands of civilization. The distances involved in space travel are much larger than those on a planet’s surface. Where a trip of a thousand kilometers over­ land is considered quite long on a planet, traveling the same distance into space from the surface barely takes a ship into orbit. On the other hand, a trip of hundreds of thousands of kilometers, from a planet to its moon for example, can be considered a short hop. When traveling aboard a starship, there are two types of travel: sublight travel and hyperspace travel. SUBLIGHT TRAVEL Sublight travel happens in realspace while a ship is run­ ning under her sublight engines. Traveling from a planet's surface to one of its moons or flying between planets in the same system are trips that are undertaken at sublight speeds. These journeys are measured by the hundreds of thousands and millions of kilometers, and even at the incredible speeds at which starships travel in realspace can require many days to complete. Table 7 -1 2 : Sublight Travel Times presents a number of examples of rough travel distances and times to help both the Game Master and the players estimate the length of time of their trip and plan accordingly. These are simply guidelines, however, and should not be taken as hard fact. There are any number of obstacles or ex­ tenuating circumstances that could shorten or lengthen a trip, from exceedingly heavy traffic to a freak meteor shower to the appearance of an Imperial fleet in orbit. Ultimately, the Game Master should remember that the exact length of any trip at sublight speeds is left to his discretion and such movement happens, essentially, at whatever speed the plot requires. TABLE 7-12: SUBLIGHT TRAVEL TIMES Trip Time Example 5 - 1 5 minutes Time needed to fly from a planet's o rb it to a safe hyperspace jum p distance. 3 0 - 9 0 minutes Time needed to fly from a planet's surface to one o f its moons. 6-12 hours Time needed to fly from one planet to another within the same star system This tim e varies a great deal depending on the relative position o f the planets in question, and any stellar phenomena between them. 1 2 -7 2 hours Time needed to fly from the center o f a star system to its furthest limits. Again, this time varies greatly depending on the size o f the system and any obstacles o r stellar phenomena encountered along the way. HYPERSPACE TRAVEL Whereas sublight travel is how ships move between the planets of a single star system, hyperspace travel is how they travel between the stars themselves. Essentially another dimension accessed through the fantastic tech­ nology of the hyperdrive, hyperspace allows starships to travel at many times the speed of light, shortening a trip that would take thousands of years at sublight speeds to a handful of days or weeks. Although it is a mature technology and ships travel relatively stable hyperspace routes that are updated constantly, traveling through hy­ perspace is still a dangerous proposition. Although it has been studied and scrutinized for as long as the sentient spacefaring races have used it, the exact nature of hyperspace remains a mystery. What is known about it is that hyperspace is essentially an alternate dimension that exists conterminously with re­ alspace. This means that anything traveling through hy­ perspace is traveling the same direction in realspace. It is this conterminous nature that allows for the mapping of hyperspace and the establishment of hyperspace routes. The relationship between objects in realspace and their reflection in hyperspace is well documented. Objects, especially large objects with powerful gravity like planets and stars, cast a shadow in hyperspace, and thus they exist in both planes at once. For exam­ ple, if a star exists at a certain location, its reflection exists in the same location in hyperspace. The hyper­ space shadows possess the same mass and gravity in hyperspace as the objects that cast them possess in realspace. For all intents and purposes, they physically exist in hyperspace and present a serious and concrete obstacle in both planes. Due to the existence of hyperspace shadows, there is no straight, fixed hyperspace route from one end of the galaxy to another. Ships moving through hyper­ space must navigate around these obstacles as they do in realspace. This is why fixed, well-established hyperspace routes exist between major population centers in the galaxy, although fixed is a relative term due to the fact that the galaxy is constantly in motion and, therefore, so are its hyperspace lanes. Navigating even the most well documented hyper­ space route entails a raft of incredibly complex calcu­ lations, which are largely handled by a ship’s navicom- puter. Although the navicomputer does the bulk of the work, a ship’s captain or, in those ships large or lucky enough to have one, its astrogator, still needs to enter coordinates and double-check the computer’s final calculations. Under ideal conditions, this requires an Easy (^ ) Astrogation check Conditions are rare­ ly ideal for those living on the fringes of the galaxy, and the Game Master should use the modifiers in Ta­ ble 7 -1 3 : Astrogation Modifiers to increase the difficulty of the Astrogation roll to reflect the circum­ stances under which it is being made. TABLE 7-13: ASTROGATION MODIFIERS+oDescription ♦♦♦ Damaged o r missing astromech droid or navicomputer ♦ Quick calculations or entry into hyperspace under duress, typically while escaping from pursuit. ♦ Ship is lightly damaged. ♦ ♦ Ship is heavily damaged ♦ Outdated, corrupt, or counterfeit navigation charts or navicom puter data. Once a ship is actually in hyperspace, there is little for the crew and passengers to do but sit back and en­ joy the ride. All hyperspace routes have an average du­ ration, in hours or days, based on the time required for a ship equipped with a Class 1 hyperdrive to make the trip under ideal conditions. Again, conditions are rarely ideal when dealing with hyperspace travel, and transit times can be shortened or lengthened due to any num­ ber of complications. As with sublight travel, the time it takes to travel between star systems is left to the Game Master’s discretion. When deciding the length of time needed for any given trip through hyperspace, the GM should consult Table 7 -1 4 : Hyperspace Travel Times for general guidelines in determining the trip’s duration. These average times are modified by a ship’s hyperdrive class, and can be further modified by the Game Master at his discretion due to complications with the Astrogation check, fluctuations in the route, outdated charts, or any other reason he sees fit. Of course, most starships (especially civilian vessels) do not have a Class 1 hyperdrive. To determine the ac­ tual travel time of a starship, first determine the hyper­ drive travel time. The GM should consult Table 7 -1 4 , VEHICLE PROFILES I n this mechanized age, where whole worlds are ur­ banized and massive starships ply the darkness between the galaxy’s countless stars, ground-based vehicles are ubiquitous and as essential to daily life as food, water, and a reliable sidearm. From the simplest, most utilitarian landspeeders to lumber­ ing groundcars to high-performance airspeeders like the Talon-I Cloud Car, planetary vehicles are found on most, if not all, inhabited worlds. Planetary vehicles in the Star Wars galaxy fall in to four broad categories which encompass a dizzying array of walkers, ground- cars, and speeders of every stripe. FATAL ENCOUNTERS O f all the well documented hazards of trav­ eling through hyperspace, none is more feared or more potentially devastating than a collision with a mass shadow. Although every hyperspace-capable ship is equipped with a number of sensors and failsafes designed to drop the ship immediately into realspace if it passes dangerously close to a gravity well or mass shadow, accidents do happen and there are many documented cases of a ship in hy­ perspace colliding with a planet or flying into the heart of a star. This, obviously, spells cer­ tain death for the entire starship and anyone aboard. In certain, very rare cases, the starship can even come out of hyperspace far too close to a planet’s surface and crash at dangerous speeds. This could even do considerable dam­ age if it has the misfortune of impacting a city or other population center. It is the fear of both such occurrences that keeps a dedicated corps of explorers, astrogators, and cartographers busy keeping hyperspace charts up to date. then using that information as a basis, he can give an exact travel time between the two points. Then, he mul­ tiplies this travel time by the hyperdrive’s Class. So, the time for a Class 1 hyperdrive remains the same. How­ ever, a ship with a Class 2 hyperdrive would take twice as long to get somewhere, a Class 3 hyperdrive would take three times as long, and so on. TABLE 7-14: HYPERSPACE TRAVEL TIMES Distance Traveled Average Duration W ithin a sector Ten to twenty-four hours W ithin a region Ten to seventy-two hours Between regions Three days to one week. Across the galaxy One to three weeks. AIRSPEEDERS As ubiquitous as their land-based cousins, airspeeders are found on nearly every civilized world in the galaxy. They are, in general, small-to-medium-sized atmospher­ ic craft with aerodynamic hulls propelled by repulsorlift technology. The repulsorlift engines are commonly cou­ pled with powerful ion drives that allow them to reach in­ credible altitudes and even enter low orbit if necessary. In their multitude, they fill a number of civilian and mili­ tary roles not suited to either the common landspeeder or the high-tech and high-maintenance starfighter. AIRSPEEDER Small civilian airspeeders are commonly used for plea­ sure or sport, or transporting cargo and passengers. Civilian models such as these are rarely armed or ar­ mored. This profile represents a generic airspeeder. Vehicle Type/Model: Airspeeder/Civilian. Manufacturer: Various manufacturers. Maximum Altitude: 300 kilometers. Sensor Range: Short. Crew: One pilot. Encumbrance Capacity: 10-30. Passenger Capacity: 1 -6 Cost/Rarity: 10,000 credits/3. Customization Hard Points: 1 Weapons: None. STORM IV CLOUD CAR The first high-atmospheric airspeeder to be classified as a cloud car, the Storm IV was built by Bespin Motors for use by Cloud City’s Bespin Wing Guard. Designed as a fast patrol and interdiction craft, the Storm IV is a sturdy, reliable airspeeder composed of two single-oc­ cupant armored pods joined by a central spar. The port side pod holds the pilot and is equipped with a number of sophisticated sensors and an advanced navigation system. The starboard pod holds the craft’s gunner along with the targeting and fire-control com­ puters. While the Storm IV can’t leave the atmosphere, each pod is pressurized and provides oxygen for high altitude flights. While they are typically used in patrol and interdiction roles, they can also be used in more martial roles to give air support to law enforcement. INCOM T-16 SKYHOPPER Beloved of hot-rodders, daredevils, and law enforce­ meant agencies throughout the galaxy, Incom’s T-16 sky- hopper is as fun as it is dangerous. A tiny, fragile craft with a pyramidal hull and three airfoils arranged in a tri­ angular formation, the skyhopper is fast, nimble, and incredibly demanding of its pilots. Equipped with a pres­ surized, one-person cockpit and powered by redoubt­ able E-l 6/x ion engines, the T-l 6 is capable of both as­ tonishing straight-line speed and aerial agility from low altitude to the limits of the atmosphere. Built primarily for pleasure and sport flying, armed and lightly armored skyhoppers are used by many law enforcement agen­ cies and paramilitary forces around the galaxy for re­ connaissance and patrol. Some even serve as trainers for starfighter pilots, as the control layout and perform­ mance share features with starfighters like the Z-95 Headhunter and the new T-65 X-wing.

This low-profile, wedge-shaped airspeeder seats its two crew back-to-back in a cramped but well laid-out cockpit with the pilot facing forward and the systems operator facing aft. The T-47 draws power from Karydee’s reliable KD49 repulsorlift engine, which gives it immense towing power while providing better than average speed and agility. Sup­ plementing the KD49 is one of Incom’s 5i.2 ion afterburn­ ers, which provides extra thrust when needed. Like many of Incom's products, the T-47s were designed with an eye to end-user m odification. In this case, Incom designers fe lt that since the in­ dustrial and commercial economies of the galaxy are so varied, a vehicle designed to work in these environments should be easily adaptable to any job or environment. The speeder's repulsorlift en­ gine produces an immense amount of power, and combined with a number of redundant electrical systems and a m odular design, the T-47 can easily handle both the weight and power demands of af­ term arket modifications. Incom itself sells a num­ ber of m odification packages for the T-47, as do a number of smaller manufacturers. It’s also ru­ mored that some param ilitary and insurgent forc­ es in the galaxy have m odified these stout vehicles with weapons and heavy armor, a rum or not o u t­ side the realm of possibility, but one that is o ffi­ cially denied by Incom. INCO M T - 4 7 A IR S P E E D ER Vehicle Type/Model: Air Speeder/T-47. Manufacturer: Incom Corporation. Maximum Altitude: 1 75 meters. Sensor Range: Close. Crew: One pilot, one co- pilot/cargo handler. Encumbrance Capacity: 6 Passenger Capacity: 0. Cost/Rarity: 1 8,000 credits/5. Customization Hard Points: 3. Weapons: Aft Turret Mounted Electromagnetic Har­ poon (Fire Arc Aft; Damage Critical Range (Close); Knockdown, Ensnare 5, Limited Ammo 1). ELECTROMAGNETIC HARPOON M ounted in a remote-operated turret aft of the cockpit, the T-47's electromagnetic harpoon was designed with towing in mind. Controlled by the speeder’s systems operator, or by the pilot in a pinch, the harpoon consists of a pneumatic cannon that launches a short durasteel rod con­ nected to a few dozen yards of high-tensile braid­ ed cable. The rod is tipped with a powerful elec­ tromagnetic disc that receives its power through the harpoon’s cable, which is in turn connected to a powerful winch located in the hull beneath the cannon. While not a weapon per se, the har­ poon can be used to knock down personnel or droids, move obstacles, ensnare large creatures or vehicles, and generally create havoc, hence its Knockdown and Ensnare qualities. LANDSPEEDERS The personal, commercial, and military vehicle of choice for most sentients, landspeeders are produced in countless millions by hundreds of manufacturers such as SoroSuub and Incom. Landspeeders use low- output repulsor engines to keep the vehicles hovering a constant one to two meters off the ground. Turbofan engines provide forward and reverse thrust. They typi­ cally have a maximum altitude of less than one hun­ dred meters, can carry passengers or various amounts of cargo, and are cheap, efficient, and reliable. Running the gamut from speeder bikes and small, two-person runabouts to massive transports, civilian landspeeders make up the bulk of production from the major speed­ er manufacturers. Military and law enforcement land­ speeders have decidedly heavier armor and weapons. Speeders ignore hazards and the effects of terrain lower than their operational altitude. A militarized version of Aratech’s successful 74-Y speed­ er bike, the 74-Z is a high-performance speeder bike used by Imperial military forces as a scout, courier, and fast combat transport vehicle. Roughly four and a half meters long, the 74-Z is, like most speeder bikes and swoops, little more than a powerful repulsorlift engine with a saddle and flight controls strapped to it. The pilot controls its movements via two sets of handlebar mount­ ed controls and two sets of footrest mounted controls. Those in Imperial military service are equipped with corn- links, rudimentary optical sensors, and a close-range comlink jammer, as well as a light repeating blaster.

MOBQUET FLARE-S SWOOP Popular among swoop gangs and adrenaline junkies throughout the galaxy, the Flare-S is the very epitome of the swoop builder’s art. The Flare-S is a high-perfor­ mance, one-person sport swoop built for raw, straight- line speed as opposed to agility. Powered by a super­ charged Mobquet R1k repulsorlift engine supplemented by a number of thrust vectoring turbothrusters, this tiny swoop has enough power to overtake or outrun nearly anything in its class. TRASTA-A5 HEAVY SPEEDER TRUCK Built by Trast Heavy Transports, the A-A5 is a popular vehicle among the Outer Rim Territories. Built to haul heavy bulk cargo long distances over rough terrain, the lumbering A-A5 has a stiff and rugged hull equipped with hardened systems that can shrug off even the heaviest abuse. In addition, armor add-ons can make it all but impervious to small-arms fire. The vehicle is sep­ arated into two main compartments: the crew compart­ meant and the cargo compartment. The cargo compart­ meant is capacious and features a number of tie-downs, latches, and other cargo management apparatuses that keep the cargo safe and secure. When not hauling car­ go, fold-out benches in the cargo hold can be deployed to carry up to twenty-five sentients, albeit in cramped and uncomfortable conditions. Vehicle Type/Model: Swoop/Flare-S.

X-34 LANDSPEEDER SoroSuub's X-34 is a two-passenger, coupe-styled ci­ vilian landspeeder known for its solid reputation for reliability. Powered by SoroSuub’s Twinstar repulsorlift engine and supplemented by a trio of low-output tur­ bofan engines, the X-34 provides utility and respect­ able performance, if not a large amount of style or dash, in a sturdy, affordable package. More utilitarian than many offerings from SoroSuub, this speeder has little in the way of amenities. It has a snug cockpit with two form-fitting seats covered in hard-wearing rubber­ ized fabric. The controls are simple and the speeder is easy to drive, making it a useful utility speeder. Corellian Mining intended the vehicles to serve as semi-autonomous mining operations on rough, fron­ tier worlds. Their primitive but reliable nuclear fusion steam reactors and multiple treads ensure they sel­ dom break down, and their weight and armor means they can survive the harshest environments. Digger crawlers are robust and customizable enough that they can be found across the galaxy, and put to uses they were not originally designed for. A good example of this can be found on the planet Ta- tooine. There, countless digger crawlers were left be­ hind by various mining consortiums over the years, only to be salvaged and repurposed by nomadic Jawa clans. Now these "sandcrawlers” roam the wastes of Tatooine, looking for scrap, and selling and trading to moisture farmers and other nomads. Vehicle Type/Model: Landspeeder/X-34. Manufacturer: SoroSuub Maximum Altitude: 1 meter. Sensor Range: Close. Crew: One pilot. Encumbrance Capacity: 15. Passenger Capacity: 1 Cost/Rarity: 4,500 credits/2. Customization Hard Points: 2. Weapons: None. WHEELED AND TRACKED VEHICLES Perhaps the oldest extant mechanized transportation technology in the galaxy, vehicles propelled by mul­ tiple wheels or articulated tread or tracks, colloquially known as groundcars or ground vehicles, are typically found on backwater, less civilized worlds. Cheaper than either speeders or walkers, they also tend to be more reliable and easier to maintain than more advanced forms of transport. Despite their limitations and primitive nature, some military vehicles still utilize treads and wheels due to their inherent reliability and all-terrain capabilities. Wheeled vehicles suffer the effects of ter­ rain as discussed in Ground Vehicles and Ter­ rain, page 253, while tracked vehicles treat all terrain as if it were one step lower difficulty. CORELLIAN MINING CORPORATION DIGGER CRAWLER Built by the Corellian Mining Corporation as a mas­ sive mobile mining and smelting facility, the digger crawler appears to be a treaded box that towers some 20 meters above the surrounding landscape. Vehicle Type/Model: Mobile Refinery/Digger Crawler. Manufacturer: Corellian Mining Corporation. Sensor Range: Medium. Crew: 50 miners and engineers (or 100 Jawas). Encumbrance Capacity: 400. Passenger Capacity: 30 (or 60 Jawas). Cost/Rarity: 50,000 credits/7. Customization Hard Points: 5. Weapons: None. Many smaller or poorer fringe worlds can not afford military or law enforcement vehicles with expensive repulsorlift technology or construct the heavy walkers utilized by the Imperial Army. Instead, many of these worlds supply their militaries or self-defense forces with transports utilizing older but reliable wheeled or treaded propulsion. These personnel carriers are usu­ ally extremely simple, which does have the advantage of making them more reliable. P E R S O N N E L C A R R I E R Vehicle Type/Model: Croundcar/Personnel Carrier.

Cost/Rarity: 3,000 credits/2. Customization Hard Points: 3. Weapons: None. WALKERS Considered a compromise between rugged, sorely Un­ ited groundcars and versatile yet high-maintenance rr pulsorlift vehicles, walkers are a relatively common site in the galaxy. Using two or more multi-jointed legs and sophisticated gyro-stabilized drive sys­ tems, these vehicles walk in the manner of ani­ mals or people. Used in a number of civilian and military applications, walkers are well suited to the rugged terrain of the uncivilized or lightly populated worlds typical in the Outer Rim, and are considered very capable all-terrain vehicles. Walkers ignore the handicaps of most kinds of rough ground, making easy work of traversing terrain that would strand even the most capable ground- car or tracked vehicle. Similar to repulsorlift vehicles, walkers ignore penalties from light terrain, and ig­ nore penalties from difficult terrain com­ posed of any hazard lower than half the vehicle’s height. Developed by the Republic during the Clone Wars, the AT-PT is a small, one person infantry walker designed to carry a single trooper into battle in even the most hos­ tile environments. Known for their sturdy and relatively simple construction, these vehicles are composed of a well armored central command pod suspended be­ tween two dextrous, reverse-articulated legs. The cen­ tral pod houses a cramped, environmentally sealed cockpit with just enough room for the pilot, a sidearm, and an emergency kit. The AT-PT easily traverses a wide variety of terrains from thick forest to plains and cramped urban centers, fording shallow bodies of wa­ ter and climbing inclines up to forty-five degrees. AT-PTs are armed with a versatile array of anti-per­ sonnel weaponry, including a powerful twin blaster cannon and a repeating concussion grenade launcher in the walker’s "chin," allowing it to destroy troops and light vehicles. While their sensors are, at best, rudi­ mentary, they are equipped with a powerful, encrypt­ ed comlink that allows a squad of these small walkers to work extremely efficiently together.

AT-EST EXPLORATION AND SURVEY WALKER Developed by Rothana Heavy Engineering to serve the needs of the Old Republic's civilian exploratory corps, the AT-EST is a six-legged, low-slung walker designed to haul both passengers and cargo through rough terrain and hazardous environments. Resem­ bling a scaled-down version of the Old Republic’s AT- TE combat walker, the AT-EST consists of a bulbous, heavily armored hull supported by six sturdy multi- jointed legs with broad, four-toed feet. The hull con­ tains a forward cockpit, a central living and working area with tiny, two-person private berths, a common area, a workshop, and a secure cargo hold. In its role as an exploration and survey vehicle, the AT-EST is equipped with a number of sophisticated computers and sensors that can detect sound, radia­ tion, and energy, as well as take samples and assess the exact nature of a world’s environment. Since it is designed to operate on untamed worlds and in hostile environments, the entire vehicle is environ­ mentally sealed. These walkers are a common sight among the worlds of the Outer Rim, and are in high demand among militaries and civilian groups alike. GROUND VEHICLES AND TERRAIN V ehicles that travel on or in close proximity to the ground are affected by natural and man-made terrain features that can make piloting more dif­ ficult. Depending on its difficulty and makeup, ter­ rain reduces a vehicle’s speed. In addition, just like with starfighters, the speed the vehicle is moving determines the difficulty of any Pilot (Planetary) checks that might need to be made to navigate the area. In addition, the terrain involved may add further complications to the check. TABLE 7-15: DIFFICULT TERRAIN Terrain Light terrain.

STARSHIP PROFILES S tarships come in a wide variety of shapes and styles, from tiny, dangerous starfighters to lumber­ ing bulk transports. There is very little standardiza­ tion among the various ships built by the numerous species of the galaxy. Most alien ships defy descrip­ tion or classification, and even many human-built ships using tried and tested ship-building techniques are hard to classify. In general, however, starships fall into three broad categories: Starfighters and patrol boats, freighters and transports, and capital ships. STARFIGHTERS AND PATROL BOATS Starfighters and patrol boats are the smallest hyperspace- capable starships found in the galaxy. These tiny, powerful ships have faithfully served galactic governments, plan­ etary defense forces, pirate clans, and even Jedi for millen­ nia. While they share some overlapping missions, starfight­ ers and patrol boats are generally quite different in their construction, load-out, and usage. Starfighters are small, short-range, one- or two-person spacecraft used by military and paramilitary forces as force projection and escort craft. Powered by small re­ actors with multiple ion engines and backup repulsorlift engines for atmospheric work, they are quite fast and ag­ ile, typically lightly armored, carry minimal shields, and have limited or no hyperspace capabilities. Depending on their role (space superiority, interception/pursuit, bomb- ing/anti-capital ship, etc.), starfighters are armed with a diverse mix of weapons. Due to their small size, and short range starfighters are typically deployed from planetary airbases or carried into battle by larger, sturdier ships Patrol boats are larger and sturdier vessels. Typically between a starfighter and a light freighter in size, patrol boats are designed for intra-system patrols, interdiction, law and customs enforcement, and long-range recon­ naissance. They typically carry a crew of between two and six and are equipped with hyperdrives, navicom- puters, and, on some models, sophisticated communi­ cations and sensor suites. While patrol boats are usually slightly slower than starfighters, they are more heavily armed, shielded, and armored. Below are a selection of starfighters and patrol boats commonly found operating in the Outer Rim. CLOAKSHAPE FIGHTER The KSE CloakShape is an aerospace fighter first built by the now-defunct Kuat Systems Engineering in the decades leading up to the Clone Wars. With their relatively aerodynamic, lifting body fu­ selages, CloakShapes were designed as aero­ space superiority fighters with an emphasis on atmospheric and near-or­ bital combat. They are powered by a pair of KSE 807b/9 afterburning ion engines backed up by a light repulsor­ lift, a setup that gives the fighter respectable speed but marginal agility. They have no hyperdrive and carry no shields; to compensate, CloakShape fighters have rein­ forced, heavily armored hulls, which makes them incred­ ibly durable. Despite their lackluster performance, short range, and limited scope, CloakShape fighters have sol­ diered on for decades now thanks to two important fea­ tures: they are inexpensive and are easily customizable. It’s often said that there's no such thing as a stock Cloak­ Shape fighter. The fighter’s simple design, modular compo­ nents, and plethora of universal power and computer cou­ plings make these ships prime candidates for modification. Over the decades, numerous aftermarket systems have been designed and sold for the CloakShape, and their ease of installation and use has allowed these fighters to com­ pete against modern starfighters with some success. The most common are upgraded powerplants, hyperdrives and navicomputers, shield generators, heavier weapons, and more sophisticated communications and sensor sys­ tems. This makes the nominally obsolete starfighter an at­ tractive option to budget-minded individuals. Hull Type/Class: Starfighter/CloakShape. Manufacturer: Kuat Systems Engineering. Hyperdrive: None.

C U S T O M IZ A T IO N Curich Engineering Stabilizer Conversion Kit: Pro­ duced by Curich Engineering, a subsidiary of Santhe/ Sienar Technologies, this bolt-on wing and stabilizer kit was designed specifically for the CloakShape fighter to address a number of its handling shortcomings. So ubiquitous is this modification that most people familiar with the little fighter believe it to be original to the CloakShape’s design. It consists of a bolt-on wing and stabilizer assembly that at­ taches to the aft of the fighter over the engines, along with a number of tweaks to the ship’s engine, thruster, and rud- SYLIURE-Z5 HYPERDRIVE SLED D esigned to add hyperspace capabilities to smaller ships without hyperdrives like starfight- ers and some patrol boats, TransGalMeg Indus­ tries Syliure-25 is one example of a number of similar sleds and hyperspace rings in use through­ out the galaxy. Equipped with a class 2 hyper­ drive and either an Rl or R2 astromech droid, the Sylurie-25 is good for five hyperspace jumps. It attaches to the starfighter (any starship with silhouette 3) and reduces its handling by 2 and speed by 1, but can be jettisoned and reattached in space. A Syliure-25 costs 10,000 credits. Recently, KSE re-introduced the Firespray to mar­ ket in response to increased demand for law enforce­ meant and patrol vessels from Imperial controlled worlds. The new ships are built from the plans for the original six prototypes, albeit with the benefit of three decades of advancement in shipbuilding technology. Thanks to growing demand and an aggressive adver­ tising campaign, the new ships are a hot commodity among law enforcement agencies, bounty hunters, and even some smugglers and pirates.

FIRESPRAY SYSTEM PATROL CRAFT With their elephantine ap- j pearance, unique upright flying position, and rotating internal cockpit that allowed for horizontal landings, Fire- sprays were considered revo­ lutionary in both their looks and design. Initially, only six prototypes were built and delivered to a Republic prison on Oovo IV shortly before the Battle of Naboo. Of those six ships, one was stolen by a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, and the oth­ er five destroyed to deter pursuit. The loss of such expensive prototypes came as a heavy blow to KSE, and they mothballed the Firespray program. Envisioned primarily as a pursuit and system patrol craft, the original six Firesprays were powered by a quar­ tet of KuatX-F-16 high-output power generators powering a pair of KDY F-31 ion engines that took up much of the ship’s internal space. The combination of generators and drives gave the ships more than enough speed to deal with errant freighters, transports, and shuttles. Designed for utility rather than comfort, the ships’ interior spaces were incredibly cramped. A small cargo hold is located in the lower aft section of the ship, equipped with a guard station and six small holding cells. Wedged in between the generators, ion drives, and other ship’s systems is the unique rotating cockpit that moves the pilot and his con­ trols through 180 degrees during take off and landing Corellian Engineering’s JumpMaster-class long range scouts are small, one-person vessels designed for au­ tonomous, long-range scouting and reconnaissance. Relatively fast and agile, JumpMasters have a flat, roughly crescent-shaped hull packed with the ship’s powerful and sensitive sensor systems. An off-set, cylindrical pod located to starboard of the ship’s centerline houses the cockpit, the pilot’s small and spartan quarters, and the ship’s power generators and drive system. Lightly armored and carrying only a light laser cannon as armament, JumpMasters rely on their speed and sensors to avoid trouble. Thanks to their powerful sensor suite, JumpMas­ ters serve in many planetary militaries as picket ships and early warning patrol craft within star sys­ tems. Their primary user, however, is the galaxy’s Civilian Astrogation Corps, the volunteer group of explorers, astrogators, and cartographers re­ sponsible for keeping hyperspace navigation charts up to date.

LAMBDA- CLASS T-4A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE A common utility shuttle used by the Imperial Navy, Sienar Fleet Systems’ Lambda-class shuttles are a common sight at Imperial installations. Slow and sturdy, these shuttles were de­ signed to haul both passengers and cargo, and can be configured as troop carriers, heavy cargo shuttles, and even luxury VIP trans­ ports. Lambda-class shuttles have a heavily armored square hull with a single tall vertical stabilizer mounted to the dorsal part of the main hull. Two additional fold­ ing wings with an inverted gull wing design help stabi­ lize the vessel. Lambda-class shuttles are driven by two SFS-204 ion engines with an SFS S/ig-37 hyperdrive providing long-range capabilities. Incredibly well-armed for a shuttle, they are equipped with a number of laser and blaster cannons in both forward and aft hard points that give the ship good fire coverage. Instead of stan­ dard escape pods, the entire forward bridge section detaches from the hull as a lifeboat in case of emer­ gency. Incredibly useful and surprisingly versatile for a military design, these ships are often the target of ship thieves and pirates and can, on occasion, be pur­ chased at staggering cost from the black market.

TIE/LN STARFIGHTER The primary space superiority fighter of the Imperial Navy, the tiny and fragile Twin Ion Engine fighter has been in service for decades. Light, fast, and incredibly nimble, the iconic TIE fighter is a bare-bones, no-non- sense fightercraft. Consisting of a spherical, lightly ar­ mored command module with a large circular transpar- isteel viewport attached to two massive hexagonal wing and solar panel assemblies, the TIE fighter has no shields, no landing gear, no hyperdrive, few comput­ erized systems, and no life support system, requiring the pilots to wear vacuum suits. Every bit of fat was trimmed from the initial design, resulting in a blister­ ingly fast and shockingly agile ship, albeit one with a high attrition rate. Along with being light, the ship is also incredibly sim­ ple. It draws its power from a miniature version of SFS's l-a2b solar ionization reactor, which collects solar en­ ergy from the panels in the fighter’s wing assemblies. This generator powers the twinned, high-output SFS P-s4 ion engines from which the craft takes its name, as well as the twin linked laser cannons under the cockpit. TIE fighters are necessarily short-range fighters. When not based at planetary or orbital naval installations, they must be carried into battle by carrier ships such as Star Destroyers or escort frigates. Hull Type/Class: Starfighter/TIE Series.

BTL-A4 AND BTL-S3 Y-WING ATTACK STARFIGHTER Koensayr’s Y-wing is a dedicated heavy attack and bomber starfighter. Known affectionately as the wish­ bone by its pilots, the Y-wing consists of a central fuse­ lage section flanked by two drive nacelles mounted to reinforced pylons. The central section houses a heavily armored cockpit with full life support and pilot support systems, as well as all of the ship’s weapon systems, with an astromech socket directly abaft. The Novaldex power generator, along with the fighter’s shield genera­ tor, hyperdrive, and numerous other essential systems, is mounted amidships with engine nacelles on either side. Each contains a powerful Koensayr-produced R200 ion engine. In keeping with their role as ship killers, Y-wings have thick armor and heavy shields to protect them while they close with targets. With their slim cross-section, sturdy protection, and powerful weapons, they are well suited to a role that requires them to fight their way to a tar­ get, deliver their ordnance, and fight their way back. De­ spite their reputation for reliability, Y-wings possess some quirks that make them relatively high maintenance. This has led to frustrated crews and technicians permanently removing the largely cosmetic hull plating for ease of con­ stant access to the fighter’s internal systems; it’s a rare Y-wing that flies with its hull plates intact. The BTL-A4 Y-wing is a single-seat variant, while the BTL-S3 has a second seat for a sensor officer/gunner be­ hind the pilot. In the BTL-S3, the gunner fires the ion can­ non turrets, while in the BTL-A4, they are fixed forward and controlled by the pilot. This profile covers both vari­ ants, as there are almost no additional differences. Z-95-AF4 HEADHUNTER Designed as part of a joint venture between In- com Corporation and Subpro Corporation during the early days of the Clone Wars, the tiny Z-95 was considered one of the most capable starfighters of its day. Small, lightly armored, and shielded, the Headhunter is a one-man, short-range fighter pow­ ered by an Incom 44-a5 multi-reactor. The aerody­ namic fuselage combined with an incredible thrust- Hull Type/Class: Starfighter/ BTL Y-Wing. Manufacturer: Koensayr Manufacturing. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 1, Backup: None.

Initially classified as an interceptor and armed with wing-mounted triple blaster cannons, the Headhunter quickly proved itself a competent space superiority fighter. It has gone through numerous redesigns, and today, most sport twin laser cannons and concussion missile launchers. Despite their age, the Z-95 remains a popular starfighter. Considered outdated compared to mod­ ern fighters such as Koensayr’s Y-wing and Incom's brand new X-wing (a fighter that shares more than a passing resemblance to the Headhunter), sales of the little fighter are still brisk in the Outer Rim territories.

STARFIGHTERS AND FREIGHTERS W hile the default starship for a group of play- er characters is a light freighter of some type, the GM should not be afraid to allow his players to obtain starfighters as well. Dogfights in snubfighters are an iconic aspect of Star Wars, after all. However, if a group chooses to invest in fight­ ers, they should keep in mind that many have limited or no hyperspace capability. So if the group wants to travel, they'll have to take this into account. Luckily, if most of the group is using a freighter while one or two players have starfighters, most light freighters have exterior clamps to haul one or two snubfighters through hyperspace. If the entire group has snubfight­ ers, though, they’ll need to make arrangements for long distance travel, or ensure they invest only in fighters with hyperspace capability. GAT-12H SKIPRAY BLAST BOAT Another pre-Clone Wars design, Sienar Fleet Systems' Skipray Blastboat is a heavily armed and armored patrol craft and gunboat descended from the ancient Turbostorm-class gunships used by the Old Republic. Officially listed as a patrol boat in SFS advertising, the Skipray seems to defy classification. Slightly larger than a typical heavy starfighter, these ships consist of a narrow, heavily reinforced and armored forward hull section and an aft rotating wing and pylon section. The forward section houses the four crew in a reinforced command cabin. Two short canards angle down from the sides of the cockpit, each equipped with a Siep-lrol Omni-Vu sensor array that gives the Skipray exception­ al battlespace awareness. The forward hull section also houses the majority of the ship’s weapons systems, with an ion cannon, proton torpedo launcher, and con­ cussion missile launcher clustered in the nose and a turret-mounted twin laser cannon aft of the cockpit on the ship's dorsal ridge. The rotating wing assembly that makes up the aft third of the ship consists of two swept-forward wings connected to an armored collar rotating around the ship’s powerful single ion engine. The wings are deployed in a vertical configuration for flight and rotate horizontally for landing, and each is tipped with an ion cannon. Although it was initially designed for use by the Impe­ rial Navy as a heavy, hyperspace-capable starfighter, it was largely rejected by the Admiralty as it didn’t fit into the Navy’s rigid order of battle, which at the time es­ chewed heavy, multi-crewed fighters. In response, SFS began selling the Skipray on the open market. There it garnered a loyal following among both planetary defense forces and the various corporate, mercenary, and pirate fleets that operate in the Outer Rim. Skiprays make a deadly and competent patrol and anti-shipping vessels, and can easily threaten ships many times their size. Hull Type/Class: Patrol Boat/Skipray. Manufacturer: Sienar Fleet Systems.

FREIGHTERS AND TRANSPORTS The life blood of intergalactic commerce, transports and freighters are the ships that carry the agricultural, industrial, and commercial bounty of the galaxy to all of its people. Used by militaries, governments, and private concerns, these are spacious, generally slow vessels with multi-person crews designed to move goods from production to market as quickly and safe­ ly as possible. Most major ship builders make at least one or two models of freighters or transports. Other companies (Corellian Engineering Corporation for ex­ ample) have made their names and fortunes produc­ ing nothing but high quality commercial vessels. Freighters are small, comparatively fast vessels designed to carry smaller cargoes. These ships are crewed by between two and six crewmen, and typically have accommodations for passengers as well as capa­ cious cargo holds. Most freighters are designed and built with an eye towards ease of modification, and are commonly found in the hands of small, independent shipping concerns or single owner/operators. Transports are huge, lumbering ships designed to carry bulk cargo on long-haul trips throughout the galaxy. Slow and ponderous with little or nothing in the way of armor, weap­ owns, or shields, transports must rely on armed escorts to protect them­ selves from the predation of pirates and raiders. They are most likely to be found in the fleets of massive corporate entities, powerful shipping magnates, and the logis­ tics corps of large navies. The following list is a collection of some of the more common freighters and trans­ ports in use in the galaxy. ACTION VI BULK TRANSPORT The latest in the popular Action series of bulk trans­ ports, Corellian Engineering Corporation’s Action VI is a prime example of what makes a transport. Heavy, slow, and ponderous, the hundred-meter-long Action VI class has an angular, lightly armored hull with a tall, narrow cross-section. They have two main cargo holds, one forward and one aft, equipped with sophis­ ticated cargo handling and security systems that can be configured to carry anything from massive sealed shipping containers and palletized cargo to livestock. The crew live and work in a heavily reinforced, cylin­ drical hull pylon that spans the ship’s dorsal ridge be­ tween the fore and aft cargo holds. ILH-KK CITADEL-CLASS LIGHT FREIGHTER Produced by Koensayr, a company known more for its starfighters and starship components than for cargo ships, the Citadel-class is a small, relatively fast freighter built to compete with CEC’s YT and YV class of light freighters. Known for their ruggedness and re­ liability, these ships have a broad, flat hull reminiscent of the Imperial Navy’s Lambda-class shuttle with two long, side-mounted vertical stabilizers aft and a short, thick stabilizer mounted between that holds the ship’s transponder and comms array. The forward hull sec­ tion houses the bridge and living quarters for the three-person crew, with more cabins behind for pas­ sengers. Quite heavily armored for a ship of this size and class, and equipped with military-grade shields, Citadels have gained a reputation for being able to absorb incredible amounts of punishment and still deliver their passengers and cargo safely. While Citadels are, on paper, passenger carriers, they are remarkably well armed for their role. Due to their heavy weapons load-out, their powerful KM-440.al re­ actor, and midships external docking clamps that can easily be used to carry two starfighters, many have been re-purposed as fighting ships. Many of these reconfig­ ured ships have found their way into the hands of free­ booters and smugglers.

Slow-Firing 1), Forward Mounted Me­ dium Tractor Beam Projector (Fire Arc Forward; Damage —; Critical —; Range [Short]; Tractor 4). GR-75 MEDIUM TRANSPORT Inexpensive and reliable, Gallofree Yards’ GR-75- class medium transport is one of the most common bulk freighters found in the spacelanes. Used the gal­ axy over by both m ilitary and commercial concerns as a heavy lifter and long-haul transport, the GR-75 has a unique hull design consisting of a central spar or keel holding the ship’s reactor core connecting a vast network of automated cargo racks that can be easily adapted to carry containerized cargo of any size. The cargo containers (or even passenger pods) are locked into place with heavy magnetic shields that keep them secure and protect them from the dangerous environment of deep space, and the en­ tire skeleton is covered in a heavy armored durasteel clamshell containing the ship’s engines. With the ma­ jority of the ship's space given over to its cargo, the seven crew are relegated to a cramped command pod perched along the spine. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/Citadel.

Each vessel is custom-built from the keel up to the specific needs of each owner. Every decision from the hyperdrive model to which rare hardwoods and precious metals to use as accents in the VIP suite are dictated by the owner and SoroSuub’s expert ship system associates. This allows the ships to be outfitted for myriad uses from shuttling important government officials to mobile offices of powerful com­ mercial concerns to extravagant party vessels. While each yacht is unique, with features and ameni­ ties as varied as the tastes of their myriad owners, there is some commonality among them. The ship’s hull is long and narrow, with the command deck forward, of­ fering a commanding view of surrounding space through its wraparound viewports. The passengers are carried in luxurious quarters abaft the command deck that con­ tain a grand dining cabin, a single VIP suite, a recreation center, an observation deck, and a number of small but well-appointed passenger cabins. Both the sublight and hyperdrive engines are housed in outboard nacelles lo­ cated at the aft of the vessel. Hull Type: Yacht/Luxury 3000. Manufacturer: SoroSuub Corporation. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 4. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Short. Ship’s Complement: One pilot, one co-pilot/engineer. Encumbrance Capacity: 100. Passenger Capacity: 10. Consumables: One month. Cost/Rarity: 1 20,000 credits/6. Customization Hard Points: 4. Weapons: None. SPACE MASTER MEDIUM TRANSPORT The Space Master medium transport is Kuat Drive Yards' version of Gallofree Yards’ GR-75. Slightly smaller, the Space Master follows a similar design concept to the GR-75, being built around a central spar with copious attachment points for modular cargo pods. A bulbous engine assembly provides mediocre thrust, and a sau­ cer-shaped command section makes up the ship’s bow. The Space Master is slower and more ungainly than the GR-75, with slightly less cargo capacity. However, it possesses certain benefits over its competitor, include­ ing more spacious facilities for the ship’s eight crew and integral weapon mounts for defensive laser cannons. These unassuming vessels operate across the galaxy moving freight from one location to another. Hull Type/Class: Transport/Space Master, Manufacturer: Kuat Drive Yards. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 4, Backup: Class 15. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Medium. Ship’s Complement: One captain, one pilot, one co-pilot, two engi­ neers, one cargo master, three mates/crew. Encumbrance Capacity: 800. Passenger Capacity: 0. Consumables: Three months. Cost/Rarity: 1 50,000 credits/4. Customization Hard Points: 2 Weapons: One Dorsal and One Ventral Turret Mount­ ed Dual Light Laser Cannon Turret (Fire Arc All; Dam­ age 5; Critical 5, Range [Close); Linked I). STARWIND PLEASURE YACHT The Starwind-class pleasure yacht was originally Kuat Drive Yards’ attempt to create a competitor for Corellian Engineering Corporation’s YT series. However, before the project even launched, KDY changed their mind and re­ packaged the ship as a luxury yacht. The Starwind has been moderately success­ ful on the market, although its redesign never quite shook its light freighter origins. The trident­ shaped starship has two side sections mounted along each side of the ship's main hull. One side section houses the ship’s crew quarters, the other contains a reasonable sized cargo hold. The central spar contains the bridge, guest quarters, stateroom, lounge, galley, conference room, holotheater, and even a zero-gee relaxation table. All in all, the ship has a thorough catalog of amenities, as well as sub­ stantial cargo space. However, the Starwind’s main drawback is that it costs as much as a light freighter and luxury yacht combined. This has kept sales lukewarm, although some particu­ larly rich smuggler barons and criminal lords have taken the ship as their personal vessel/command center. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/Starwind. Manufacturer: Kuat Drive Yards. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class I , Backup: Class 1 5. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Medium. Ship’s Complement: One pilot, one co-pilot, one en­ gineer, two gunners. Encumbrance Capacity: 85. Passenger Capacity: 10. Consumables: Four months. Cost/Rarity: 210,000 credits/6. Customization Hard Points: 2. Weapons: One Dorsal and One Ventral Turret Mount­ ed Medium Laser Cannon (Fire Arc All; Damage 6; Critical 5; Range [Close]). WAYFARER-CLASS MEDIUM FREIGHTER Kuat Systems Engineering’s Wayfarer-class is a rela­ tively new entry to the medium transport market. Designed to accommodate unique modular shipping containers built specifically for the ship, the Wayfar­ er was designed to revolutionize galactic shipping. In reality these ships had a rocky development pro­ cess. By the time the first Wayfarers came off the stocks for their shakedown cruises, the project was terribly over budget and behind schedule. Only one of the many types of shipping container was actu­ ally built, the bulk cargo container. This, combined with the fact that the Wayfarer’s cargo containers are bespoke and the ship can’t carry standard shipping containers, limited its usefulness. Although they nev­ er revolutionized shipping, they have found a niche among wealthy shipping conglomerates in the devel­ oped parts of the galaxy where their owners have custom containers fabricated. The vessel itself has a strange, ungainly design, with the modular cargo container hung from an armature that extends from the port side of the ship’s hull. The ship is slightly unbalanced and requires a talented and even-handed pilot to make the most of it. CEC’s production facility. Due to the sheer number of vessels extant and the long decades for which they’ve been in service, the YT-1300 is a common sight among the freebooters, smugglers, and pirates of the Outer Rim. Indeed, many of these rugged men and women count these ships as either the first or the fin­ est ship they’ve ever owned, and commonly both. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/Wayfarer. Manufacturer: Kuat Systems Engineering. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 14. Navicomputer: Yes. Ship’s Complement: One pilot, one co-pilot, one engineer, one cargo master, six crew. Encumbrance Capacity: 850. Passenger Capacity: 6. Consumables: Three months. Cost/Rarity: 120,000 credits/5. Customization Hard Points: 5. Weapons: Dorsal Quad Laser Cannon (Fire Arc Forward; Damage 5; Critical 3; Range [Close]; Accurate, Linked 3). YT-1300 LIGHT FREIGHTER Perhaps the most common light freighter in service to­ day, Corellian Engineering’s YT-1 300 is the very epitome of the freighter concept. Quick, rugged, and endlessly modifiable, the YT-1 300 consists of a central main hull compartment around which are arranged a number ol modular compartments within a saucer-shaped outer hull. Two cargo mandibles extend from the bow, and the CEC trademark offset cockpit is mounted on the star­ board side of the vessel, with weapon points located in the center of the ventral and dorsal surface. In their factory configuration, a rarity among such versatile and easily modifiable ships, the YT-1 300 is relatively well armored and is equipped with a small but powerful shield generator. It mounts only one weapon, a medium laser cannon on the dorsal gun mount, but the ship features a number of built-in weapon hard points. Of the hundreds of thousands of these popular ships currently in service, perhaps no two are exactly alike, and none resemble the ships that left Hull Type/Class: Freighter/YT-1 300. Manufacturer: Corellian Engineering Corporation. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 2. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Short. Ship’s Complement: One pilot, one co-pilot/engineer. Encumbrance Capacity: 1 65. Passenger Capacity: 6. Consumables: Two months. Cost/Rarity: 100,000 credits/4. Customization Hard Points: 6. Weapons: One Dorsal and One Ventral Turret Mount­ ed Medium Laser Cannon (Fire Arc All; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range: (CIose) YT-2400 LIGHT FREIGHTER Corellian Engineering’s YT-2400 class light freighters are an update of the aging, reliable YT-1 300 class. Using the lessons learned over the decades since the YT-1 300’s initial launch, CEC’s engineers packed as much power and as many sophisticated flight and cargo handling systems into the YT-2400 as it could possibly hold. The YT-2400 has a saucer-shaped hull with a central circular core surrounded by cargo and passenger modules. Like all YT series freighters, it has a starboard-mounted cock­ pit connected to the main hull by a pair of reinforced py­ lons. The cockpit section contains its own access hatch and crew escape pod. Overall, these ships are slightly smaller than the YT-1 300, thus they make better, more efficient use of the space available to them. The bow of the ship and forward cockpit pylon contain the ship’s main cargo hold and the crew quarters. Opposite the cockpit are the common galley and refresher, and abaft the central core are a number of private cabins, the en­ gineering bay, and the passenger escape pod. While officially built as a civilian freighter to be used for legitimate business, Corellian Engineering’s mar­ keting and development departments are fully aware that the majority of their customers are, perhaps, on the far side of the law. The ship is touted as being “ Double Plated,” which is essentially advertising- speak for military grade armor. YT-2400s also feature heavy shields, room for larger reactors and ion drives, and a number of dedicated weapon hard points that come out of the shipyard unused. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/YT-2400. Manufacturer: Corellian Engineering Corporation. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 2. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Short. Ship’s Complement: One pilot, one co-pilot/engineer. Encumbrance Capacity: 1 40. Passenger Capacity: 6 Consumables: Two months. Cost/Rarity: 1 30,000 credits/5. Customization Hard Points: 5. Weapons: Dorsal and Ventral Turret Mounted Twin Medium Laser Cannons (Fire Arc All; Damage 6; Criti­ cal 3; Range [Close); Linked 1). STAR GALLEON ARMED TRANSPORT Used primarily by the Imperial Navy’s Logistics Corps as a long-haul heavy cargo lifter, the Star Galleon is yet another sturdy and well founded ship from the shipwrights at Kuat Drive Yards. A massive, plodding, humpbacked vessel, this frigate-sized transport carries 100,000 tons of bulk cargo in its cavern­ ous modular cargo holds. The ship itself is as utilitar­ ian as a ship can be. The forward quarter of the ves­ sel contains the bridge, crew quarters, and primary systems. The remainder of the ship is given over to cargo space. Abaft the command decks is a hulking, multi-decked cargo hold equipped with countless sliding bulkheads, retract­ able decks, sophisticated anti-boarding systems, and a state-of-the-art cargo handling system. The two hull sections are, in fact, detachable, in case the ship is ever in danger of losing its cargo. Both the command section and the cargo hold are hyperspace capable. The forward section has a traditional hyperdrive and navicomputer, while the cargo section uses an auto­ mated emergency escape system that transitions it into hyperspace as soon as it is jettisoned, to keep it out of the hands of pirates. Due to their size, durability, and heavy armament, Star Galleons are used by the Empire to transport high-value cargoes without needing escort vessels. Hull Type: Transport/Star Galleon. Manufacturer: Kuat Drive Yards. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 5. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Medium. Ship’s Complement: One-hundred fifty officers and enlisted crew. Encumbrance Capacity: 10,000 or more, depend­ ing on configuration. Passenger Capacity: 300. Consumables: Six months. Cost/Rarity: 1,500,000 credits (R)/7. Customization Hard Points: 2. Weapons: Five Port and Five Starboard Mounted Re­ tractable Medium Turbolasers (Fire Arc Port or Star­ board; Damage 9; Critical 3; Range [Long); Slow Firing 1, Breach 4), Forward Concussion Missile Launcher (Fire Arc Forward; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Short); Breach 4, Blast 4, Guided 3, Slow-Firing 1). CAPITAL SHIPS This broad category includes immense military vessels that bear enormous martial might. Capital ships are usually armed with the heaviest shields and the most powerful ship-board weaponry in the galaxy. Manned by crews in the hundreds, if not thousands, these stellar behemoths often house entire fighter squadrons and even smaller capital ships within their cavernous hangar bays. CR90 CORVETTE A versatile light capital ship, Corellian Engineering's fast, reliable CR90 class corvette is a small multi-purpose ves­ sel popular with both militaries and civilian organizations. Long and sleek, the CR90 has a distinctive, wasp-waisted profile with a narrow midships section flanked by a mas­ sive bank of eleven Cirodyne ion turbine engines aft and a broad, hammerhead bridge and crew section forward. CR90s are remarkably fast and agile for ships of their size, and can be configured as a troop carrier, cargo hauler, a passenger liner or consular ship, or even a heavily armed escort vessel. The corvettes usually mount a pair of T&B twin turbolasers in dorsal and ventral midships turrets as their main weapons. Along with the turbolasers are four light turbolasers, two to a side, mounted dorsally in turrets on the midships hull section. This makes them well suited to running blockades and acting as heavy escorts for cash-strapped militaries. Hull Type/Class: Corvette/CR90. Manufacturer: Corellian Engineering Corporation. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: None. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Long. Ship’s Complement: 30-1 65 depending on configuration. Encumbrance Capacity: Up to 250 0 depending on configuration. Passenger Capacity: Up to 600 depending on configuration. Consumables: One year. Cost/Rarity: 1,200,000 credits/5. Customization Hard Points: 4. Weapons: Dorsal and Ventral Turret Mounted Twin Medium Turbolaser Batteries (Fire Arc All; Damage 10; Critical 5; Range [Long]; Breach 3, Linked 1, Slow- firing 1), Two Port and Two Starboard Turret Mounted Light Turbolasers (Fire Arc Port o r Starboard; Damage 9; Critical 3; Range (Medium); Breach 2, Slow Firing 1). DP20 GUNSHIP Known colloquially as the "Corellian Gunship," the DP20 is designed from the keel up as a pure, single­ purpose military vessel. Built by CEC for the fleets of the Galactic Republic, DP20s were deployed in response to increased threats from both droid starfighters and rogue bands of pirates fielding fleets of secondhand snubfighters. Composed of three hull sections strung along a single long reinforced multi­ decked corridor, these ships are powered by an over­ sized ionization reactor giving it significant speed. Bristling with turbolasers, quad laser turrets, and con­ cussion missile launchers, these ships are dedicated starfighter killers. They are heavily armed and shielded to protect them from massed fighter attacks, and are equipped with powerful targeting computers that al­ low the weapons to track and traverse fast and agile starfighters. This means the Corellian Gunship is a con­ summate anti-starfighter and anti-capital ship vessel. However, despite their utility, few of these ships see ac­ tive duty with the Imperial Navy of today. CAPITAL SHIP CAPACITY C apital ships and large freighters are ex­ tremely sizable, and thus have a great deal of capability for carrying cargo. Due to this, the encumbrance capacities listed are simply the minimum capability the ship has for transport­ ing supplies and resources. Most of these ships could carry far more if the need arose. STARFIGHTER DEFENSE C apital ships tend to mount heavy turbolasers and ion cannons to combat other large ves­ sels. These ships are the only ones large enough to mount such heavy weapons. However, it does tend to leave them vulnerable to much smaller and more agile snubfighters. Turbolasers and ion cannons fire more slowly and are unable to tra­ verse rapidly enough to target these ships effec­ tively, and the larger surfaces of the ships means the weapons need to cover wider fire zones. For this reason, some capital ships mount dead­ icated anti-starfighter weapons, typically laser cannons and blasters. Doing so is a calculated trade-off—every anti-starfighter weapon takes up power and space that could go towards more powerful guns. However, some designers consider the trade-off worthwhile, especially when building mid-sized “escort" vessels. When firing auto-blasters, blaster cannons, la­ set cannons, and quad laser cannons, capital ships (and only capital ships!) count their sil­ houette as one less. ship, and RSS was left with an unwanted design. Eventu­ ally, RSS sold the Marauder’s production rights to the Cor­ porate Sector Authority where it found a home among the CSA’s navy and numerous planetary governments and law enforcement organizations throughout the Outer Rim. Today, the venerable Marauder corvettes still see service with numerous governmental, paramilitary, and pirate organizations in the Outer Rim. The ships them­ selves are long and graceful with a heavily armored, wedge-shaped forward section and broad, downward- sloping wings aft above the drives. Thanks to their fa­ vorable power-to-weight ratio, Marauders are relatively quick and agile for their size. With their good handling characteristics, a heavy armament of light turbolas­ ers and tractor beams, and the capability of carrying a squadron of fightercraft, these ships can hold their own against nearly anything in their class. Hull Type/Class: Frigate/DP20. Manufacturer: Corellian Engineering Corporation. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 6. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Long.

MARAUDER-CLASS ASSAULT CORVETTE The reliable Marauder-class corvette is an old, tried-and- true that has seen service in navies the galaxy over since the days of the Galactic Republic. Designed and built by Sienar Technologies, the Marauder was envi­ sioned as a fast, flexible patrol and escort vessel. While these ships were initially slat­ ed for the Republic Navy, they decided against the Hull Type/Class: Corvette/Marauder. Manufacturer: Republic Sienar Systems. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: None. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Medium. Ship’s Complement: 177 officers, pilots, and enlisted crew. Starfighter complement: Twelve fighters, two shuttles. Encumbrance Capacity: 175. Passenger Capacity: 80 troops. Consumables: Three months. Cost/Rarity: 5,000,000 credits (R)/5. Customization Hard Points: 1. Weapons: Four Forward Mounted and Four Turret mounted Light Double Turbolasers (Fire Arc Forward or All; Damage 9; Critical 3; Range (Medium); Breach 2, Linked 1, Slow-Firing 1), Three Forward Mounted Light Tractor Beam Emitters (Fire Arc Forward; Dam­ age - ; Critical - ; Range (Close); Tractor 2). EF76 NEBULON-B ESCORT FRIGATE Kuat Drive Yards' Nebulon-B frigates were design­ nated escort frigates by. the Imperial Navy, and typically assigned to roles__ such as con-,, voy escort, s c o u tin g , and picket d u t i e s . Long and d e c e p tiv e ly fr a g ile - lo o k - ^ , I ing, these vessels consist of a mult.M deck forward section mated to a bulky aft engineering section by a single thin spar, and carry a surprising amount of weaponry for their size, in­ cluding a dozen turbolasers, numerous light laser cannons, and even a trio of tractor beams. Along with the energy weapons, those frigates in Im peri­ al service carry two squadrons of twelve TIE fig h t­ ers. Along with their heavy arm or and s tu rd y shields, this makes Nebulon-B frigates formi- dable opponents. Hull Type/Class: Frigate/ Nebulon-B. Manufacturer: Kuat Drive Yards. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 2. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Long. Ship’s Complement: 920 of­ ficers, pilots, and enlisted crew Starfighter Complement: Twenty-four starfighters.

STARSHIP AND VEHICLE MODIFICATIONS F or those special individuals who make their living in the spacelanes, a starship is as much their home as it is a simple means of transport or a company asset. As they live aboard it and get to know a ship's vari­ ous attributes, both positive and negative, it is not un­ common for the crew to make various modifications to the ship to better tailor it to their needs. By tinker­ ing with existing systems, or through the purchase of new parts and modification packages, a skilled and dedicated crew can improve a ship’s general comfort and performance beyond what her designers initially imagined. More powerful sublight engines, faster hy­ perdrives, better sensors, and other, more esoteric modifications are commonplace among the profes­ sional spacefarers, hot-rodders, and inveterate tinker- ers that operate in the Outer Rim. ATTACHMENTS The following are a small selection of common attach­ ments seen on customized ships in the Outer Rim Territories. They run the gamut from docking clamps and larger engines to hidden compartments and more powerful armor. This is not intended to be a compre­ hensive list, as such a list is well outside the scope of this publication, but it is meant to be representative of what can be done to customize a spacecraft. Came Masters are encouraged to design their own attach­ ments to fit their players’ tastes and the needs of their campaigns, and more options for attachments will ap­ pear in future supplements. STARSHIPS, VEHICLES, AND MODS L ike personal equipment, starships and ve­ hicles can benefit greatly by being modded. Starships and vehicles follow the rules for at­ tachments and mods as discussed in Chapter V: Gear and Equipment. The only difference is that installing each mod costs ten times as much on a starship or vehicle (due to their greater size and complexity). ADVANCED TARGETING ARRAY The Sureshot Advanced Targeting Array by Taim & Bak is a good example of a targeting computer, us­ ing sophisticated holo-imaging to present a pilot or gunner a detailed, three-dimensional view of his tar­ get. Installation of the ATA increases the accuracy of a ship’s weapons, and allows gunners to get more shots on target, increasing their effectiveness in combat. This may be applied to all starships and vehicles. Models Include: Taim & Bak LR-375a "Sureshot" Advanced Targeting Array, Fabritech KR-770 "Sharp­ shooter" Targeting Computer, Koensayr Manufactur­ ing 840.z Holo-Targeting Suite, Fabritech ANx 42.a "Snapshot” Targeting Computer. Base Modifiers: Upgrades the Ability of Gunnery checks when firing the ship’s weapons by one. Modification Options: 1 Additional upgrade Mod, I Innate Talent (Sniper Shot) Mod, 1 Innate Talent (True Aim) Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 4,000 credits. ENHANCED CARBON-DURASTEEL ARMOR Produced by numerous starship manufacturers, these armor plates are made from a complex lattice of carbon nanotubes embedded with spun threads of durasteel. Molecularly bonded to a ship’s hull, they provide extra armor protection at the cost of a ship’s maneuverabil­ ity. This may be applied to all starships and vehicles. Models Include: Ferro-Magnesium Armor Plate, Cer- ro-Ablative Sheets. Base Modifiers: Adds one point to starship armor, and reduces starship handling by one. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 2,000 credits times the silhouette. ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES SUITE Designed to blind and deafen enemy ships, electronic countermeasures suites such as Fabritech 995 ECM sys­ tem transmits a dense stream of white noise and junk data that fogs sensors and jams comms traffic within close range of the broadcasting ship. While this makes the broadcasting ship hard to see or hit, the energy re­ quired to run the ECM suite tends to put undue strain on the ship’s electrical systems. Other systems have focused modes that can target specific ships at longer ranges. This may be applied to all starships and vehicles. Models Include: Fabritech 995 “Stormcloud” Elec­ tronic Countermeasures Suite, Miradyne 4x_Phantom Short-Range Sensor Jammer (starfighters only), KDY 220-SIG Tactical Combat Jammer (capital ships only). Base Modifiers: Blocks sensors within range, count­ ing the ship or vehicle’s silhouette as one step smaller when being fired at. Immediately notifies all ships in a star system or within 100 kilometers if planetside to the ship or vehicle’s existence. Modification Options: 1 Increase difficulty by 1 when making subsequent attacks due to the Guided quality Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 3,000 credits. HYDRAULIC CONTROL CIRCUITS Hydraulic control circuits are a throwback to an earlier era of shipbuilding. Instead of using tra ­ ditio na l conductive m aterial pressed into com ­ posite wafer boards to transfer electrom agnetic energy, HCCs use countless, near-microscopic transparisteel tubes full of highly conductive liq ­ uid metal sim ilar in its com position to mercury. Held under pressure and regulated by a series of valves, this metal controls the flow of energy. Bulky, antiquated, and d iffic u lt to work with, these circuits do have an incredible resistance to the effects of ion weapons, a fact th a t has not gone unnoticed among spacers. This may be ap­ plied to non-fighter starships. Models Include: Corellian Engineering Hy­ draulic Control Circuits, Santhe/Sienar Hard­ need Circuitry, Fabritech Insulated Circuitry. Base Modifiers: Ships equipped with these attachments suffer half damage from weap­ owns possessing the Ion quality, after damage is reduced by soak. When installed, decrease handling by one, and decrease system strain threshold by one. Modification Options: 1 Defender chooses ship component affected by Ion Weapon qual­ ity, as opposed to the attacker Mod, 1 Increase system strain threshold by one Mod. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 1,000 credits. REINFORCED SHIELD GENERATOR A good defense is crucial to keeping a starship operational in the rough and tumble space of the Outer Rim. P-K’s AEGIS Shield Generators and other reinforced shield generators upgrade a ship’s stock particle and ray shielding so as to make it stronger and to make the shields easier to manage. While the AEGIS improves only one de­ fense zone at a time, further tinkering with these units has resulted in improved shield strength. This may be added to any ship or vehicle. Models Include: Phoah-Kingsmeyer 721a AE­ GIS Shield Generator, KDY 880 Palisade Shield Generator, Sienar SH-2/a.Z Shield Reinforcement. Base Modifiers: One additional point of de­ fense to one defense zone of choice. Modification Options: 2 one additional point of defense to one defense zone of choice Mods. Hard Points Required: 2 Price: 3,800 credits. SMUGGLING COMPARTMENTS These are concealed compartments installed in starships, especially freighters and transports, for the transportation of contraband. Used to hide goods and occasionally people from prying eyes, they are incredibly hard to spot. Common places for smug­ gling compartments are beneath deck plates, behind heavy equipment, or in a thousand other bolt-holes throughout a vessel. This may be added to any ship or vehicle with encumbrance capacity 25 or more. Models Include: None. Base Modifiers: Stores items up to 25 Encumbrance per compartment. This still counts as part of the total encumbrance threshold of ship. Increases difficulty of checks made to find compartment by +2. Modification Options: 2 Additional storage (25 En­ cumbrance) Mods. Hard Points Required: I Price: 1,200 credits.

Base Modifiers: Allows vehicle to carry a number of smaller vehicles (with a maximum silhouette of 2 smaller than the carrier vehicle) in a converted auxil­ iary hanger. The maximum capacity is calculated in all vehicles’ combined silhouette. Silhouette 5 vehicles can carry a total silhouette of 5, silhouette 6 vehicles can carry a total silhouette of 20, and silhouette 7 + vehicles can carry a total silhouette of 60. (Common sense and GM’s judgement apply when determining what vehicles can and cannot fit in the hanger bay.) Modification Options: 5 Additional maximum sil­ houette capacity Mods. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: 5,000 times silhouette in credits. HYPERDRIVE GENERATOR Upgraded hyperdrive generators increase a vessel’s speed through hyperspace, allowing it to complete journeys in a fraction of the time. May be installed on any ship with hyperdrive. Models Include: Isu-Sim SSP05 Hyperdrive Genera­ tor, SFS S/ig-30 Hyperdrive System, KDY JumpStar Hyperdrive Generator. Base Modifiers: Reduces Hyperdrive class by 1, to a minimum of 1. Modification Options: 2 Reduce hyperspace class by 1 to a minimum of .5 Mods. Hard Points Required: I Price: 6,400 credits. HIGH-OUTPUT ION TURBINE A fast, powerful sublight engine, high output ion tur­ bines increase a ship's raw, straight-line speed at the cost of slightly lower reliability. May be installed on any airspeeder or starship. Models Include: Girodyne Ter40 High-Output Ion Turbine, Sienar Fleet Systems SFS-220 Ion Drives, Koensayr Manufacturing R800 Ion Ramjet. Base Modifiers: Adds one point to a ship’s speed and reduces system strain threshold by one. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: I Price: 5,300 credits. UPGRADED WEAPONS This is the simple act of mounting more or heavier weapons on a starship or vehicle. The combinations of weapon load-outs are nearly endless thanks to the diversity of weapon systems in the galaxy. May be in­ stalled on any ship or vehicle. Models Include: Arakyd Flex Tube Proton Torpedo Launcher, ArMek SW-6 Heavy Ion Cannon. Base Modifiers: See Table 7 -1 7 : Upgrading Weapons for a list of what weapons can be mounted on what ship. This is not meant to be an exclusive list, but provides a series of guidelines that can be applied to other, non-standard weapons as well. Modification Options: None.

' -Darth Vader B elief in the Force is nearly extinct in the galaxy. The Empire has relentlessly destroyed all evidence of the Jedi and their ancient religion. However, there are still those few who believe in the Force and those even rarer few who can draw from its power. These indi­ viduals know the presence of the Force still reaches through every being, planet, and star system in the galaxy. It binds, entwines, and penetrates all life. At its most basic level, the Force is balance. Within it is both joy and sorrow, rage and love, fear and hope, and light and darkness. People speak of a “light side" and a “dark side" to the Force, elements representing its positive and negative aspects. However, these as­ pects are not in conflict with each other. Rather, they all form facets of a unifying whole. Although those who call upon the Force to aid them may only tap into certain aspects of it, they still count the entirety of the Force as their ally. There are only a few individuals in the galaxy who have the ability to call upon the Force. However, this rare gift makes these individuals both admired and. feared, ■ for those who count the Force as their ally find it to be a powerful ally indeed. It allows people to perform impos­ sible tasks, project themselves from their crude mortal forms, read and influence the minds of others, and even peer into the tangled webs of the future. • Those who can manipulate the Force find that it manipulates them in turn: It guides their actions and obeys their commands. For this reason, how one usds the Force is important. Those who use the Force for knowledge and defense instead of aggression and ambition, who act when they are at peace with them­ selves and others, find their actions bolstered by the light side. However, those who call on the Force for destruction, and who tap into their hatred, anger, and fear, find their destructive desires reinforced and am­ plified by the dark side of the Force. There are those who say. the dark side of the Force is easier to use, more seductive, and that it constantly tempts those who can sense the Force. However, it is not stronger. When one is calm, when one works to preserve and defend, he finds the power of the light side of the Force to be just as mighty as the dark side. JEDI AND THE DARK SIDE Since before the earliest days of the Old Republic, the Jedi existed in the galaxy. The Jedi studied the Force and wielded it to protect life and defend peace. For a thousand generations, the Jedi stood as guardians of justice and order in the Old Republic, protecting it and those within it from cruelty, injustice, and oppression. A true Jedi stood as a paragon of virtue, displaying patience, courage, and wisdom. His order served as ar­ biters and protectors in the Old Republic, remaining vigilant for corruption and malevolence. They called on the Force when they were calm and tranquil, at har­ mony with themselves and others. In turn, the Force imbued them with great powers. There have never been more than a handful of Jedi in the galaxy, when counted against the countless planets full of sapient life. However, with the Force by their side, they were enough to protect the Old Republic for millennia. However, they could not do so forever. Just as the Force has a malign, dark side, there are those who are willing to take the quick and easy path to power, and use the dark side of the Force to accomplish their nefarious goals. Those who embrace this destructive path have long stood in opposition to the Jedi. They have gone by many names, but the one best known to the Old Republic was the Sith. The Sith believed the true power of the Force lay within the dark side. They claimed its strength and determination provided a power denied to the Jedi. They did not always stand alone, either, for to deny the dark side and stand true to the light is a most dif­ ficult task. Many Jedi have proven unable or unwilling to remain true to the tenets of their order and resist the temptation of easy power. These Jedi fall to the dark side, becoming agents of evil. Only the strongest and most resolute can pull themselves back to the light after embracing the darkness. Two of these individuals, a Dark Lord of the Sith and a fallen Jedi, proved the final downfall of both the Old Republic and the Jedi Order. After the horrors of the ancient wars between the Old Republic and the Sith Empire, the Sith faded into obscurity and myth. The Old Republic entered an age of peace and prosperity, and eventually complacency and stagnation. However, the Sith still existed, and they had not forgotten. The dark lord Darth Sidious rose to power in secret, ma­ nipulating the framework of galactic governance. At the same time, he adopted a public guise as Palpatine, the Republic Senator from a minor planet named Na- boo. None knew of his dual personas, and he secretly manipulated events to create crises and become Su­ preme Chancellor, the elected head of the Republic. Meanwhile, as Darth Sidious, he secretly manipulated many members of the Republic into outright insurrec­ tion, thrusting the entire galaxy into the terrible Clone Wars. Possessing the emergency powers of a wartime leader, Palpatine was on the cusp of taking control of the Republic from within. However, he needed one final piece to accomplish his goals, and he found it in the young but extremely powerful Jedi Anakin Skywalker. Skywalker’s corruption and fall to the dark side was arguably one of Darth Sidious's greatest achievements. Reborn as Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, Skywalker and his master turned on the Jedi Order and destroyed them. Palpatine crushed the separatist forces, then turned the Republic’s armies on the Jedi. Flush with tri­ umph, he declared himself Emperor, proclaiming a de­ sire to protect order and stability in the galaxy. Though almost nobody knew it, Darth Sidious had accomplished what the Sith had not been able to—the conquest of the Old Republic and the destruction of the Jedi. THE FORCE IN THE EMPIRE Most, though not all, species have some connection to the Force. However, some are more sensitive than others. Typically, Force sensitivity is an inherited trait, passed down through generations of Force users, but it can appear in others without warning. In the days of the Jedi, Force-sensitive beings were usually discovered at an early age and taken to the Jedi temple to learn the ways of the Force. Those days are gone. Under the Galactic Empire, Force users are hunted down and destroyed, or sometimes corrupted by Darth Vader and the Emperor to embrace the dark side. A Force-sensitive being has to learn how to use the Force on his own. This can often be a painful process that takes a great deal of dedication, as well as trial and error, to grasp even an inkling of understanding about the Force. Without proper training, such beings rely on will and in­ stinct to guide them through their journey. They possess powers they barely understand, and thus risk falling to the dark side without even realizing it. Thus a Force user must keep his connection to the Force a secret, only di­ vulging his abilities to those few he knows he can trust. FORCE DICE T he Force die # is the seventh die in Edge of the Empire, a twelve-sided white die. On it are white circular symbols representing the light side of the Force • , and black circular symbols repre­ senting the dark side of the Force Q The Force die is unique among the dice in Edge of the Empire because, unlike the other dice, the Force die does not generate symbols that contribute towards success or failure. In addi­ tion, the Force die's light and dark side sym­ bols do not cancel each other out. Instead, the Force die generates resources, both light and dark, available for the player to use. THE FORCE IN EDGE OF THE EMPIRE A ny character in Edge of the Em pir e, with the excep­ tion of droids and a few other specific species, can theoretically be Force sensitive. Being Force sensitive is by no means the same as being a Jedi. There are plenty of individuals whose minds are slightly more in touch with the Force than those of average people, but who will never become a Jedi. In the game, the ability to use the Force is repre­ sented by a character’s Force rating. Most characters have a Force rating of zero. They are not cut off from the Force, but they cannot affect it, and it does not have much influence in their day-to-day lives. Those who are Force sensitive, however, have a Force rating. FORCE-SENSITIVE CHARACTERS As mentioned previously, a character with a Force rat­ ing of one or higher is considered Force sensitive Force sensitivity does not provide a character with bonuses or abilities in and of itself. However, it allows access to abilities and provides the means to activate and use Force powers. Force powers will be discussed later in this chapter. Certain talents in specialization trees may only be selected by Force-sensitive characters, and certain specialization trees may only be accessible to some­ one who is Force sensitive. In addition, certain talents and abilities may affect Force-sensitive characters dif­ ferently, or may only affect such characters (or not af­ fect them at all) If this is the case, it will be described in the rules section of the talent or ability in ques­ tion. Likewise, talents and specialization trees that can only be taken by Force-sensitive characters will indicate this status in their descriptions. BECOMING FORCE SENSITIVE In Edge of the Em pire, the primary way one becomes a Force-sensitive character is by choosing the Force Sensitive Exile specialization (see the following page). This specialization is fundamentally the same as the specializations starting on page 53 and is consid­ ered a specialization in all respects. However, there are several notable differences. This specialization is a universal specialization. The experience point cost to take a universal specializa­ tion is always ten times the total number of special­ izations the character would possess with this new specialization. While this means it costs the same as a career specialization, universal specializations are not career specializations. Players should be aware of additional limitations to becoming Force sensitive as well. For example, the Droid species cannot become Force sensitive, and certain oth­ er species open to player characters have similar limita­ tions (this is listed in a species’ specific entry). Because these species cannot become Force sensitive, they can­ not select the Force Sensitive Exile specialization. FORCE SENSITIVE EXILE T he Jedi are gone, the vast majority hunted down and destroyed by the Emperor and his minions. If any survive, they do so in hiding at the farthest edges of the galaxy. The Galactic Empire regards the ability to use the Force as a crime punishable by the harshest measures. In a few short decades, most of the galaxy has forgotten the Jedi, and dismissed the Force as an ancient religion. For many, this is by far the safest option. Flowever, although the Empire has purged the Jedi, not all who use the Force have been hunted down and killed. The galaxy is simply too large to track down every Force-sensitive being, and the Emperor’s infamous Or­ der 66 and the hunts that followed primarily concerned themselves with pursuing true Jedi and their descen­ dants and allies. In the hidden corners of the galaxy, those who can touch the Force remain hidden, hunted, and outcast...but alive. The Force Sensitive Exile specialization does not have any career skills associated with it. Flowever, when a character purchases this specialization, he au­ tomatically receives a Force rating of 1, if he did not already have it. If he already has a Force rating of 1 or higher, it does not increase. Although technically someone is Force sensitive from birth, it can take a great deal of time for him to realize he has this power. For this reason, the Force Sensitive Exile specialization can be taken during character creation or at any later point, just as any other specialization. The Force Sensitive Exile is not just any Force- sensitive being; he is one who survived the purges. Fie may have been a young Padawan or even a minor Jedi who managed to flee the Empire and hide. Fie may also have been a child, hidden by friends or family. Whatever the case, he’s spent the last decades in a hostile galaxy. Flis formal train­ ing is likely to be limited or even non-existent, and he uses his powers carefully or not at all. Even his mastery of the Force is shaped by his experienc­ es—his powers focus more around concealment and control than flashy displays of ability.

FORCE TALENTS The Force Sensitive Exile specialization possesses a number of unique talents, referred to as Force talents. Force talents are talents only available to individu­ also who possess a Force rating. They represent the Force’s ability to aid an individual in minor ways, not complex enough to be individual Force powers. Often, these talents represent the character's ability to un­ consciously tap into the Force; they are his instinctual awareness of the Force and surroundings. Force talents follow all the rules for talents, with the additional caveat that they can only be used by indi­ viduals who have a Force rating of 1 or higher. FORCE POWERS The primary means by which a Force user manipu­ lates the Force is not unconscious however. A true Force user can deliberately tap into the Force to change and manipulate himself and his surroundings. The Force can allow someone to do things others may see as fantastic or even unbelievable: levitating items, blocking blaster shots with one’s hands, controlling the minds of others, and even predicting the future. Force powers are the means by which a Force-sen­ sitive character accomplishes those tasks. In Edge of the Em pire, Force powers are broad and overarching abilities that allow Force-sensitive characters to per­ form impressive and fantastic feats. Each Force power focuses on a particular task that can be performed through the manipulation of the Force. The initial purchase of each Force Power costs 10 experience, although once purchased, the user may spend additional experience to further custom­ ize and enhance his power. ACTIVATING POWERS Most Force sensitives use their Force powers through a variant of Edge of the Empire’s core mechanic, as­ sembling a dice pool and rolling it to see if the pow­ er resolves successfully. However, unlike most skill checks, Force power checks do not generate success­ es. Instead they generate resources that are spent to fuel a power’s effects. Unless stated otherwise in the power’s description, acti­ vating a Force power is an action. When a Force-sensitive character attempts to activate a power, he creates a dice pool that consists solely of a number of Force dice equal to his Force rating. He then rolls the dice. Every light side result O generates one Force point the character may spend to fuel the power’s abilities. Every dark side result ©generates no Force points, and is disregarded. However, the dark side of the Force is always offer­ ing easy power, tempting a Force user to give in and accept its aid. A Force sensitive character may choose to allow one or more © to generate additional Force points—in addition to the Q The consequences that come with this choice can be dire, and can gravely affect the individual who gives in to this temptation. Full-fledged Jedi and other powerful Force users suf­ fer unique penalties for doing this that are not de­ tailed here. However, nobody is completely immune from the consequences of choosing the quick and easy path. A Force-sensitive character in Edge of the Empire who wishes to use one or more © to provide Force points for his power must flip one Destiny Point from light to dark—if there are no light side Destiny Points to flip, he may not use © at all. He then suffers strain equal to the number of results he wishes to use. The long-term consequences of constantly tapping into the dark side of the Force are left up to the ro­ leplaying of the player and the GM. However, both should keep in mind that the dark side is born of fear, anger, and hatred, and these emotions should be present in the Player Character. Once a player character assembles his available Force points, he consults his Force power and de­ termines how he will spend them. Most of a power’s abilities require one or more Force points to activate. Unless specified otherwise, each ability may be acti­ vated multiple times. Once the Force power has been resolved, this con­ cludes the character’s action. A Force power is always '‘successfully’’ activated, even if the check does not generate any Force points to spend on the power. DARK SIDE FORCE USERS E dge of the Empire assumes that any Player Character Force users are, at their core at least, reasonably "good" individuals, not evil devotees of the dark side. However, there may be cases in which a player decides his character has fallen to the dark side, and embraced it. Provided the GM allows the player to use this character, the rules for dark side Force use are a mirror for light side Force use. In the case of a dark side Force sensitive character, the check is still made as nor­ mal. However, the O are counted as Force points, while the © are discarded. If the dark side Force user wishes to use light side results to generate additional Force points, he must still flip one Destiny Point from light to dark and suffer strain equal to the number of results he wishes to use. The GM may also wish to use NPCs or adversar­ ies who are dark side Force users. In this case, they follow the rules for dark side Force users as described above unless their descriptions specify otherwise. However, the GM would flip a Destiny Point from dark to light instead. ONGOING EFFECTS Most of a Force power's effects last for a specific length of time and then end. Some effects last only for the duration of the action, while others may last for several rounds, or even minutes or days. However, some Force power effects are known as ongoing ef­ fects. Unlike other effects, ongoing effects last until the Force user deliberately ends them. Some Force powers have no ongoing effects, while others have ongoing effects exclusively. However, most Force powers have a mix of ongoing and standard ef­ fects. To activate an ongoing effect, the Force sensi­ tive character does not need to spend Force points. Instead, he must commit a number of Force dice O to fuel this effect (the number required is listed in the individual effect). Each committed O may not be used in any future checks (either checks to activate Force powers or the rare skill checks that include O) as long as this ongoing effect is maintained. The ongoing effect may be maintained as long as the Force user likes, al­ though realistically the GM may determine that certain circumstances may require him to end the ongoing ef­ fect. In essence, the Force user temporarily reduces his Force rating by his total committed O. An ongoing effect may be ended at the end of any subsequent character turn as an incidental. FORCE POWER BREAKDOWN Each Force power can be divided into two sections: the power’s basic form, and its upgrades. When a Force-sen­ sitive character purchases a Force power, he immediate­ ly gains access to the most basic form of the power. This is the first row of the Force power, when consulting the power’s visual breakdown. The basic form is the Force power at its simplest, and provides the foundation for all the upgrades that accompany the Force power. The Force power’s upgrades are the means by which players can customize the Force powers their characters access, modifying them to serve their needs and their characters’ personalities. Upgrades are purchased with experience points, and each up­ grade may only be purchased if it connects to the basic form or a previously purchased upgrade. The experience cost of each upgrade is listed in its box. UPGRADES Force power upgrades are grouped into several differ­ ent categories, as described here. • Strength: Strength upgrades amplify the basic effect of a power, making the power more potent. • Magnitude: Magnitude upgrades increase the number of targets affected by the power, allow­ ing the user to affect multiple items or individuals with a single action. FORCE POWERS AND NARRATIVE T he powers presented in Edce of the Empire are intended to fit with the game’s narrative style, and as such are left intentionally broad in scope. If players find ways to use their charac­ ters' Force powers outside of their pre-defined boundaries, the GM should consider allowing it, provided it is not abusive and adheres rea­ sonably closely the powers’ original design. In essence, players are encouraged to be creative with their Force powers, as are GMs. For example, a Force-sensitive character might notice a colleague losing his step and falling off a nearby balcony. Even though the players are not in structured time, the GM could reasonably allow the Force-sensitive character to immedi­ ately check his Move power and see if he can catch his friend before he hits the ground below. • Duration: Duration upgrades increase the length of time of the power's effects. • Range: Range upgrades increase the distance from which the Force power can affect its targets. • Control: Control upgrades add new effects to Force powers, or modify existing effects (adding or changing the way the Force-sensitive character spends Force points). These categories remain the same for each Force power, although how they modify the Force power de­ pends on the power itself. For example, the Duration upgrade for Influence increases the length of Influ­ ence’s effect by one minute or one round of combat per upgrade, whereas the Duration upgrade for Sense increases the number of times its ongoing effects can be triggered each round. Some Force powers may not have each category of upgrades, depending on the power and how it works. FORCE POWER: SENSE By opening his mind, a Force user can commune with the world around him. Fie senses the endless move­ meant of living Force, seeing beyond what his eyes al­ low. The actions of those around him are laid bare, as if the Force user had a bird’s eye view of his surround­ ings, allowing him to anticipate attacks and better strike blows of his own, or even spot ambushes and lurking foes. Alternatively, he can sense the thoughts of others. Even a Jedi cannot read someone’s mind completely, but a Force-sensitive being trained in these arts can detect his target’s feelings and emo­ tions, and even sense surface thoughts. Sense is a Force power with two distinct halves that a Force-sensitive character can enhance. Users can Force Power Tree: Sense Prerequisites: Force Rating 1 + The Force user can sense the Force interacting with the world around him.

Spend O to increase num­ ber of targets affected by power equal to magnitude upgrades purchased. rely on Sense to augment their defensive (and eventu­ ally offensive) abilities or invest in the ability to read the emotions and feelings of others. They can even read their surface thoughts, which can be particularly valuable in a wide variety of situations. BASIC POWER Sense’s basic power allows the Force user to sense the living Force interacting with the world around him. This allows him to perceive other life close by and read the emotions of a single individual. The basic power has two ways to spend Force points: • The user may spend 1 Force point to sense all liv­ ing things within short range of himself (including both animals and sentient beings). • The user may spend 1 Force point to sense the current emotional state of one living target with whom he is engaged. UPGRADES Sense’s upgrades are split into two groups: those that allow the Force user to protect himself from danger and augment his attacks, and those that allow him to detect the thoughts of others. The upgrades are listed below. Flowever, as with any power, see the Sense Force Power Tree above to see the upgrade paths, availabilities, and costs. Control Upgrade: The Force user gains the ability to sense danger the moment before it strikes, allowing him to anticipate attacks and avoid incoming blows. This power gains the Ongoing effect: Commit Q . Once per Ongoing effect: Commit O . Once per round, when an attack targets the Force user, he upgrades the difficulty of the pool once. Effect: Spend O The Force user senses the current thoughts of one liv­ ing target with whom he is engaged. Sense's ongoing effects may be triggered one additional time per round. Spend O to increase power's range by a number of range bands equal to range up­ grades purchased. Spend O to increase num­ ber of targets affected by power equal to magnitude upgrades purchased. round, when an attack targets the Force user, he up­ grades the difficulty of the pool once. Control Upgrade: The Force user's ability to antici­ pate danger evolves to the point where he can antici­ pate the actions of his opponents while he takes the offensive, making his own blows harder to avoid. This power gains the Ongoing effect: Commit O. Once per round, when the Force user makes a combat check, he upgrades the ability of the pool once. Control Upgrade: The Force user gains the ability to de­ tect the surface thoughts of the target. This power gains the effect: Spend Q The user senses the current thoughts of one living target with whom he is engaged. Strength Upgrade: When using Sense’s Ongoing ef­ fects, upgrade one additional die. Duration Upgrade: Sense's Ongoing effects may be triggered one additional time per round. Range Upgrade: Spend O to increase the range at which the character senses living things by a num­ ber of range bands equal to the number of Range upgrades purchased. The Force user may activate this m ultiple times, increasing the range by this number each time. Flowever, remember the Force user must still spend Force points to activate the power’s actual effects. Magnitude Upgrade: Spend O to increase the num­ ber of targets being affected equal to the number of Magnitude upgrades purchased. The Force user may activate this multiple times, increasing the number of targets multiple times. Flowever, remember the Force user must still spend Force points to activate the pow­ er’s actual effects. FORCE POWER: INFLUENCE The ability to influence the minds of others is not something to be taken lightly, and misuse of the abil­ ity colloquially known as a “mind trick" is a sure step on the path to the dark side. A powerful enough Force user can manipulate the minds of others to the point where he can convince them to believe things that are untrue, or calm an angry crowd. Conversely, he can rile the crowd into a murderous frenzy, or frighten a single soul into gibbering madness. This is where the danger of Influence lies. Flowever, Influence is not inherently evil. Many Force users have used Influence to protect the help­ less or to deal with a threat in a way that avoids vio­ lence. It is much better to convince a guard to return to his post than to have to kill him. Influence’s most basic and arguably crudest abil­ ity allows the user to inflict strain on a living target, stressing his mind until he passes out or is otherwise incapacitated. Flowever, numerous control abilities al­ low the Force user who specializes in Influence to per­ form much more subtle and impressive feats. BASIC POWER The most basic form of Influence does not allow the Force user to guide or shape the thoughts of others. Fie can “merely” strain their mind, inflicting stress and ex­ haustion. The basic power has one effect that can be triggered multiple times on the same or different targets. • The user spends O to stress the mind of one liv­ ing target he is engaged with, inflicting one strain. USING SENSE IN THE GAME S ense can be an extremely potent ability in a game, and has arguably the most potential to derail a game as it can put the CM in the situa­ tion of being forced to divulge crucial information that can seriously undermine the tension of an adventure. Reading the thoughts of an opponent can reveal critical facts, such as the location of hid­ den hideouts, or that he plans to double-cross the Player Characters at a later date. At the same time, however, the CM should not simply deny this info­ mation to the player character. Therefore, the CM has to walk a fine line between revealing relevant information, and revealing too much information. When using this power, both players and CMs should keep the following guidelines in mind. • • Some species (and some individuals with particularly strong minds) are more resis­ tant to powers such as Sense than others. • Some species are completely immune. • Sense does not work on communica­ tions over long distances. • Sense only allows a Player Character to read the emotional state and surface thoughts of a target. This means that Play­ er Characters can only ever get an imper­ fect snapshot of another’s mind, and not simply call up the information on demand. Overall, the CM should endeavor to allow player characters to use Sense to learn valuable info­ mation they would not normally know. Flowever, this information should not allow them to au­ tomatically succeed in their goals, but instead provide a valuable foundation as they proceed. Simply put, it should help them with their work, but not do their work for them.

UPGRADES When upgrading this power, the user can choose whether he wishes to influence and sway large crowds of people with his abilities, or if he wishes to directly modify the thoughts or emotions of others. The up­ grades are listed below. However, as with any power, see the Influence Force Power Tree above for upgrade paths, availabilities, and costs. Control Upgrade: The Force user gains the ability to alter the thoughts and emotions of the target. The Force user makes an opposed Discipline vs. Discipline check with a living target he is engaged with, making an Influ­ ence Power check as part of the pool. To succeed, he must gain and spend at least one Force point and he INFLUENCE SPECIAL RULE W hen Influence is used to guide and shape thoughts and emotions, O may only gener­ ate points used to create negative emotions such as rage, fear, and hatred. • may only generate Force points used to create positive emotions such as peace, tranquillity, and friendliness. Oth­ er emotions such as confusion can be generated with either O or # . This rule is in addition to the rule about using • or O results. This means that to generate negative emotions, the average play­ er must first roll O , then flip a Destiny Point and suffer strain to use them. Spend O to increase power's range by a number of range bands equal to range up­ grades purchased. Spend O to increase targets affected equal to magnitude upgrades purchased. The Force user may make an opposed Discipline vs. Discipline check combined with an Influence Power check. If the user spends O and succeeds on the check, he can force the target to adopt an emotional state or believe something untrue, lasting for 1 round or 5 minutes. When making a Coerce, Charm, Deception, Leadership, or Negotiation check, the Force user may roll an Influence Power check as part of his dice pool. He may spend O to gain # or O (user’s choice) on the check. When stressing the mind of a target, the character inflicts 2 strain. Spend O to increase power's range by a number of range bands equal to range up­ grades purchased. Spend O to increase targets affected equal to magnitude upgrades purchased. Spend O to increase dura­ tion by number of rounds (or minutes) equal to duration upgrades purchased. Spend O to increase power's range by a number of range bands equal to range up­ grades purchased. MOVING AND DURATION n s written, the Move power does not have a set duration. This is intentional. During narrative gameplay, the duration can be as long as it needs to be; in general, users will be moving items from one point to another. If they do need to keep an item suspended for a short period of time, that's perfectly acceptable and does not require a second check. Of course, if they do need to keep an item suspended for a long period of time (more than several minutes), the GM can decide to require a second check, or start inflicting strain on the Force user as they attempt to maintain the power. The same holds true for durations during en­ counters. Generally, Force users suspend items for a single round when they use the Move power. If they wish to lift an item for multiple rounds, the GM could treat that as an ongoing effect, requiring the Force user to commit • to maintain the power. For particularly large items (silhouette 2 or larger, for example), the GM can also inflict strain equal to the silhouette each round the Force user maintains the power. How- ever, this is up to the GM, based on the circum­ stances of the encounter. must succeed on the check. If he succeeds, he may force the target to adopt an emotional state (such as fear, friendliness, or hatred), or to believe something untrue (these are not the droids you are looking for). The effect lasts for roughly five minutes, or one round in combat. If the Force user has the ability to affect multiple minds with this power (such as with the Magnitude upgrade) he may do so, but the Discipline check must be either op­ posed by the mind with the highest ranks in Discipline, or the difficulty is set statically based on the number of minds (the GM chooses). Control Upgrade: The Force user gains the ability to enhance his arguments and charisma via the Force. When making a Coercion Charm, Deception, Leader­ ship, or Negotiation check, he may roll an Influence Power check as part of the pool. Fie may spend O to gain ^ or O (his choice) per point on his check. This counts as a normal Force Power check in every way—it is simply combined with the overall skill check. Strength Upgrade: When stressing the mind of a tar­ get, the Force user inflicts 2 strain instead of 1. Duration Upgrade: The Force user may spend O to in­ crease the time this effect lasts by a number of minutes or rounds in combat equal to the number of Duration upgrades purchased. The Force user may activate this multiple times, increasing the duration multiple times. However, remember the Force user must still spend Force points to activate the power’s actual effects. Range Upgrade: The Force user may spend O to increase the range at which the character can touch minds by a number of range bands equal to the num­ ber of Range upgrades purchased. The Force user may activate this multiple times, increasing the range by this number each time. However, remember the Force user must still spend Force points to activate the power’s actual effects. Magnitude Upgrade: The Force user may spend O to increase the number of minds being affected equal to the number of Magnitude upgrades purchased. The Force user may activate this multiple times, in­ creasing the number of targets multiple times. How­ ever, remember the Force user must still spend Force points to activate the power’s actual effects. FORCE POWER: MOVE The ability to move objects with nothing more than the power of one’s mind is not exactly subtle, but it is one of the most visually impressive abilities in a Force user’s arsenal. Theoretically, the Force can move anything, no matter the size, and true Jedi have been known to hurl starships about with the Force. However, even if the Force is not limited in what marvels it can perform, most of those who use it are—by the constraints of their own mental faculties, if nothing else. Still, even the ability to pull a gun from an opponent’s hand or hurl a crate at him is extremely valuable. The Move power is one of the simplest Force pow­ ers in Edge of the Em pire, although its very simplic­ ity allows for many instances of creative use. When moving these items, the default movement speed is considered to be relatively slow and deliberate, not fast enough to cause damage. BASIC POWER At its most basic, Move allows the Force user to move small objects he is very close to. It has one basic effect: • The user may spend O to move one object of silhouette 0 that is within short range up to his maximum range. The default maximum range is short range. UPGRADES Move’s upgrades are fairly simple; they include the ability to move more objects, larger objects, and move objects greater distances. Some upgrades do give the Force user different ways to use Move, however. The upgrades are listed below. See the Move Force Power Tree on the fol­ lowing page for upgrade paths, availabilities, and costs. Force Power Tree: Move Prerequisites: Force Rating 1 + The Force user can move small objects via the power of the Force. The user may spend O to move one object of silhouette 0 that is within short range up to his maximum range. The default maximum range is short range. Spend O to increase targets affected equal to magnitude upgrades purchased. Spend O to increase targets affected equal to magnitude upgrades purchased.

Spend O to increase power's range by a number of range bands equal to range up­ grades purchased. Spend O to increase power's range by a number of range bands equal to range up­ grades purchased. The Force user can hurl objects to damage targets, by making a Disci­ pline check combined with a Move power check, dealing damage equal to 10 times silhouette. The character can perform fine manipulation o f items, allowing him to do whatever he would normally with his hands via this power at this power’s range. Control Upgrade: The Force user gains the ability to move objects fast enough that they become difficult to dodge and can be used as weapons. The impacts deal damage both to the targets and the object being moved. The Force user makes a Discipline check with a difficulty equal to the silhouette of the object being thrown, making a Move power check as part of the pool. To successfully hit the target, he must gain enough Force points to move the object from its starting location to the target and he must succeed on the check. The dam­ age is resolved following all the rules for ranged attacks. Silhouette 0 objects deal 5 damage, while other objects deal damage equal to 10 times their silhouette. The number of targets affected by a single object is up to the CM, but in general, a single object should only affect a single target (unless it’s particularly large). (Also note, if the player wants to use Move to throw multiple objects at multiple targets, he may do so using all the rules for hitting multiple targets with the Auto-fire quality.) This attack follows all the rules for ranged attacks, such as ranged defense and aiming. Control Upgrade: The Force user gains the ability to pull objects off of secure mountings or from an op­ ponent’s grasp. Control Upgrade: The Force user gains the ability to perform fine manipulation of items, allowing him to do whatever he could normally do with his hands to a held item (if manipulating something such as a control board, the controls count as a silhouette 0 item). Strength Upgrade: Spend O to increase the maxi­ mum size of objects a character can move by a number equal to the number of Strength upgrades purchased.

The Force user may activate this multiple times, increasing the range by this number each time. However, remember the Force user must still spend Force points to activate the power’s actual effects. M agnitude Upgrade: Spend O to increase the num­ ber of targets affected equal to the number of Magni­ tude upgrades purchased. The Force user may activate this multiple times, increasing the number of targets by this number each time. However, remember the Force user must still spend Force points to activate the pow­ er’s actual effects. DISTURBANCES IN THE FORCE f l ny form of rapid or violent change in the gal­ axy creates a disturbance in the Force. While death causes the greatest ripples, anything from the birth of a child to galactic cataclysms can trig­ ger these tremors to ripple through the Force like a shockwave. Force users feel these disturbances as a sense of uneasiness or discomfort that sud­ denly takes hold of them. Though this feeling varies in intensity, no disturbance should be dis­ missed lightly. They are each a sign of a transfor­ mation occurring in the galaxy. It is also through sensing these disturbances that a Force user is capable of detecting when he is in the presence of other Force-sensitive objects and beings. rTHE GAME ' MASTER W elcome to the first step in becoming an Edge of the Empire Game Master. While running a role- playing game can be challenging, it is also rewarding in ways different from those associated with playing individual characters. This chapter walks new Game Masters through the information needed to become an accomplished and entertaining Star Wars GM. Novice and experienced GMs alike should find use­ ful information and advice for running this game from both a storytelling and mechanical point of view. The Game M aster has many responsibilities when running a successful game session. The GM creates the overall storyline for the adventure. He interacts constantly with the players, describing the details their characters need to understand to enjoy the game. The GM plays the part of ev­ eryone the characters meet, and describes every­ where they go. He must think on his feet, and be ready to improvise with characters and changing situations on the fly. The GM must interpret the game rules and be ready to apply them in a fair and consistent manner. This sounds like a lot, but fortunately, a GM need not be perfect in every respect, especially when first starting out. Running a roleplaying game for friends doesn’t have to be like refereeing a sports event. The GM should want to adjudicate the rules and run the best game possible, but it is more important that everyone has a good time. When the GM hits an unexpected situation or needs a ruling on a game mechanic, making a quick judgement call and assessing the results later is perfectly acceptable. The GM’s primary goal is to create an entertain­ ing and memorable game in which everyone has fun. There are numerous ways to achieve this end, and there can be many challenges along the way. GM and player cooperation creates the best environment for an entertaining game. Great ideas from any of the participants should not be overlooked. This chapter delves into specific methods for GMs to run and plan their games. It provides guidance in preparing and running the first game session, using published adventures, creating new stories, and de­ veloping a full-fledged campaign. It includes adven­ true creation guidelines and mechanical advice for " T h a t's g o o d . Y o u h a v e t a k e n y o u r f i r s t s t e p i n t o a la r g e r w o r ld . " -Obi-Wan Kenobi good encounter design. It provides advice for dealing with players and group dynamics in and out of the game. It gives specific CM guidance for using Obliga­ tions and Motivations in character and story creation. It also advises on dice pool interpretation, and how to maximize its use during the game. Finally, this chapter includes advice on what makes an adventure or campaign fitting for the Edge of the Empire setting. It discusses the story elements and types that fit into navigating the galaxy’s underworld and fringe societ­ ies. Other story types may be told with this system, but the focus here is on the scum and villainy of the galaxy. HOW TO RUN AN EDGE OF THE EMPIRE GAME R running an Edge of the Empire game session re­ quires players, planning, rules knowledge, and an interest in creating a great deal of fun. This section guides new and experienced Game Masters through a typical game, from the first game session onward. The first several sections, from Recruiting Players through Continuing the Story, are intended for beginner CMs. The advice in the remaining sections is intended for CMs with a session or two of experience and can be safely skipped by GMs preparing for their first game. RECRUITING PLAYERS First and foremost, the game needs players. The CM should look first to his circle of friends. It’s okay if they have never played a roleplaying game before. Thanks to the popularity of the Star Wars movies, it’s likely they already have a basic understanding of the setting. This enables them to understand the overall Motivations, lo­ cations, and major events much more quickly than they might in a standalone roleplaying game setting. If the GM’s friends aren’t interested, other options include finding a local game club, game convention, or appro­ priate online gaming organization to play at or recruit from. The same holds true for players recruiting a CM. For the first session and short adventures, exact player chemistry is less important than in prolonged campaigns. Flowever, GMs and players should try to recruit others that they get along with and mesh well together. It’s helpful if they enjoy similar play styles, and have similar expectations about the game and how it will be played. If the GM is running his first game, he should tell the other players. They’ll be more forgiving while the CM learns the intricacies of the system. If they themselves are Game Masters, they may be able to give the new CM advice along the way. PREPARING AND RUNNING THE FIRST SESSION Game preparation is one of the CM’s key duties. Detailed advice is provided later in this chapter. For now, read the rules. The GM doesn’t need to memorize all of them or understand all of their intricacies for the first game ses­ sion. His familiarity with the rules will grow with every game he runs. Focus on character creation rules, as this is the first contact most players have with the game me­ chanics. They will usually look to the CM for guidance. The CM should review any specific or unusual rules used in the adventure. He should write notes regard­ ing their use, along with page numbers for quick refer­ ence. This helps to speed play. Everyone learns the game more quickly by playing, so playing in a session run by another CM can improve practical application of the rules. It might also help the CM form ideas for how he may or may not want to run his own sessions. The GM should learn basic combat rules—attacks, movement, and damage. Combat is likely in each game session. One of the GM’s primary responsibilities is to play the part of all the adversaries, enemies, allies, and bystanders during the fight. Though the GM battles the Player Characters tactically, he is not their enemy. He must roleplay the combatants, making their tactical decisions based on what each one knows about the sit­ uation, and what their goals are. While there are plenty of scenes where the bad guys will stop at nothing to eliminate the good guys, this isn't always the case. There are plenty of other entertaining ways to end a scene, without necessarily killing everyone on one side. FUN FIRST, RULES SECOND! A lways remember that everyone at the table is there to have a good time. Adjudicating the rules is important, but secondary to this goal. Don't let a rules question or interpreta­ tion derail the fun. Everyone wants to create a great tale with some wild moments. While the GM has primary control over the planned sto­ ryline, he should not overlook player ideas and actions for great, if unpredictable, results. If the CM and the players are enjoying the game, ev­ eryone is on the right track! DICE ETIQUETTE AND PROTOCOL D ice rolling is central to playing Edce of the Empire. The dice used in this game go beyond a simple indication of success or failure. The GM and players use the results of the dice pool to inform the story. Players should always roll the dice where every­ one can see the results. While this prevents play­ ers from cheating, it also allows the GM to see the exact die symbol results. While not every roll needs creative interpretation, it is a helpful story guide. See page 294 for further advice. The GM should normally roll his dice in the open. Like the players' rolls, the GM’s results are open to interpretation. More importantly, the players have ways to influence the dice pool, and therefore need to see it most of the time. There are times where the GM may want to conceal the results. Occasionally, an adversary will try something that may affect the Player Characters, but they would only become Next, read the adventure. For the first game, using a pub­ lished adventure is highly recommended, such as Trouble Brewing found on page 417. Using a published adven­ true allows the novice GM to focus on learning how to run the game, without the pressure of creating a good plot line from scratch. The GM should highlight or jot down remind­ ers about important plot points. Adventure and campaign creation will be covered later in this chapter. The GM also prepares anything needed at the table, such as maps or player handouts. The table should be big enough for everyone to have space to write and roll dice, with space in the center if the GM plans to use a map during combat. It is always a good idea to have extra dice and blank character sheets around. The GM should consider creating a couple of Player Characters prior to play. These can be used by players who don’t have one, don’t want to create one, or arrive late. Extra characters can always be used as NPCs, if needed. CHARACTER CREATION The GM should work with the players as they create their characters. Before beginning, the GM needs to convey the type of story anticipated in the session. This includes the starting location, time frame, back- story, and other details that would influence the selec­ tion of character class, species, and background. The players will have their own ideas about the char­ acters they want to play. If the GM finds that their char­ acter concept significantly conflicts with the intended plot line, or doesn’t mesh well with the rest of the group, it is his call whether to allow the character in the adventure or campaign. However, most players are will­ ing to adjust their character concepts enough to satisfy the needs of the story, and still work with the party. aware of it if the roll doesn’t go the adversary’s way. In this case, the GM probably doesn’t want to tip the adversary’s hand by revealing the results. Rolling dice in private affects the game in several ways. If the GM always conceals the roll/the players cannot influence rolls as the system expects. Of­ ten, GMs interpret rolls in the name of providing a better game experience for everyone at the table. This usually occurs when a Player Character faces death, or if one side suffers a string of poor results or bad luck. This type of interpretation is allowed, built into, and expected in the Edge of the Empire system, making it much easier to roll in the open. Also, the GM should avoid fudging too many results. It detracts from game play and the play­ ers’ sense of achievement. If they believe their success and failure comes only at the whim of the GM, they quickly lose interest in playing. It is often useful to create characters around a group concept. Edge of the Empire has built-in mechanics and story hooks for a starship-based campaign. In this case, it is easy to conceive of a group concept based around a ship’s crew, with players taking on the role of pilot, engineer, first officer, and so on. Other op­ tions could be based around smuggler, mercenary, or bounty hunter groups. The GM should encourage the players to develop at least a basic background for their character, include­ ing their Obligation and Motivation. The amount of information needed depends largely on the GM’s play style. Backgrounds can be as detailed or as basic as the GM and players want them to be. The GM can and should use suggestions and plot points from the character backgrounds to tie them into the storyline. Players throw unusual twists at every GM. One might want to play a secret Force user, while another might be an underhanded scoundrel out to make a few credits by selling private information to anyone with the cash. Backgrounds that conflict with each other can make for interesting storylines and drama, but the GM needs to be careful that it doesn’t divide the party and the players so much that it ruins all enjoyment of the game. One aspect of character creation requires direct GM involvement: Obligation. Any Obligation the characters take on adds directly to the story aspects the GM must eventually address. For the first game session, the GM should simply note the total and types of Obligation for later use. If the GM is running a published adventure, such as Trouble Brewing, additional Obligation notes and uses will be noted there. See Using Obligation on page 307 later in this chapter, for more information. LEARNING THE GAME Over the first few sessions, focus naturally falls on learning the mechanics of the game system. As the GM and players become more proficient, less time is needed for rules discussion and learning, and more can be spent on roleplaying and story ad­ vancement. Players will look to the GM for rules explanations and interpretations, but he shouldn’t feel he must make a ruling in a vacuum. The GM may ask for the player’s point of view, especially if everyone is learning the game at the same time. The GM should be fair and impartial, and take the players' points into account. In the end, however, the GM’s word is final. RUNNING THE FIRST SESSION The first session normally begins with character cre­ ation. Some GMs use the entire first session to create characters. This gives the players ample opportunity to familiarize themselves with the character creation process and their options. It also allows them to dis­ cuss their character ideas in detail, and devise pre­ liminary background histories, keeping their starting Obligation and Motivation in mind. The GM should quickly review finished characters, mainly looking for obvious mistakes. Starting the first adventure during the session is highly recommended, even if it is only to intro­ duce the characters to each other and experience a quick encounter. As play progresses, the GM should try to move the story along, and not get too hung up looking up rules for every action. Rules proficiency domes in time, and the intricacies be­ come clearer with practice. If the CM uses a published adventure, it guides the story. If the CM creates his own story, he should keep it simple. Introduce new actions and concepts a little bit at a time. Plan at least one personal scale combat encounter, a roleplaying- focused encounter, and some time for the Player Characters to interact and get to know each other. Later on, the CM can add space combat, Force use, and other specialized rules. Note that it is natural for character creation and combat to run slower the first few sessions. Play speed increases as everyone learns the rules. ROLL THE DICE The custom E dge of the E m pir e dice and symbols are often unfamiliar and intimidating to new play­ ers. The CM can get them comfortable with this part of the system by running them through a few example die rolls. Before the adventure, and per­ haps before character creation, the CM should roll the following sample checks, using the stats from a pre-generated character or one of the ad­ versaries in C hapter XII: Adversaries. The CM should read the Dice Pools: Success and Dice Pools: Failure sidebars on page 296 and 297 for sample dice pool interpretations. • Melee Attack • Ranged Attack • Skill Checks • Initiative • Destiny Points Once the first adventure is completed, what happens next? First, the GM should find out if the players had fun and discuss how the next session might be im­ proved. If the campaign is to continue, the GM should also award XP (see page 301) and other rewards such as credits or equipment. Next, the GM should give the players the opportu­ nity to alter, adjust, or scrap their characters if they so desire. Players should not be burdened with characters they do not like, especially when they are first learning the game. As players try out their characters, they may decide their original choices do not match their play style or see other options they like better or simply find more fun to play. Players changing or creating new characters should not be penalized for doing so. The GM is free to follow up on the storyline from the first adventure, or encourage the characters to move to a different storyline. This might be another published adventure or one of the GM’s own cre­ ation. For more detail, see the adventure and cam­ paign creation sections later in this chapter. MANAGING THE PARTY Managing and maintaining a gaming group takes work, even when the players are friends. Sometimes sched­ ules conflict with game times. Sometimes there are distractions during the game. Personality differences may come to the forefront due to differing play styles, or in reaction to issues brought up in an adventure’s storyline. Players may become angry when things go badly for their characters, particularly if they feel they were the victim of another player’s actions. Most of the time, none of these issues are enough to derail a campaign or split up a group. However, it can happen. Conflict can still make for some uncom­ fortable sessions, even when properly addressed. This section contains advice to help prevent or diffuse these situations. TABLE RULES Table rules are usually unwritten guidelines understood by all involved that Game Masters use to cover situations pertaining to player actions beyond the rules of the game itself. There are no hard and fast rules that pertain to ev­ ery GM or every group. However, it is best to establish guidelines for some common situations, so the players know what to expect before they arise. Table rules may apply to any of the situations below, and others that may arise due to specific circumstances within a given group. • Off-Topic Discussions: Gaming is a social gath­ ering and an entertaining pastime. Players often joke and talk amongst themselves. While this is all fine, it can derail a dramatic moment or otherwise C O N T I N U I N G T H E S T O R Y A bsent and no-show players are a common problem for GMs. Such absences can dis­ rupt or derail a storyline, so it is best if the GM plans ahead to deal with absences. If the player isn't there, find a reason for the character to be off screen during the session. There are a number of plausible reasons; may­ be he’s sick, wounded, training, taking care of other business, fixing the ship, or even de­ tained by the authorities. If the absent player’s character is central to the session or the encounter at hand, someone else may run the character. If the character holds se­ cret knowledge unknown to the rest of the group, the GM may run the character. Otherwise, it is recommended that someone from the group, or the group as a whole, runs the character. It is nor­ mally considered bad form to allow serious injury or death to occur to the character while being controlled by someone else. If the character is absolutely critical to the storyline, sometimes it is best to cancel the session and play when everyone can attend. Obviously, this should be the last resort. How­ ever, when the story itself has a major event that everyone wants to be a part of, cancella­ tion is often the best route to avoid disappoint meant and hurt feelings by the absent player. ABSENT PLAYERS disrupt game play. This is especially true when the GM is only focused on one or two players. The amount of discussion allowed or tolerated depends very much on the group, but players should be considerate of others if asked to turn their focus to the game at hand. • Distractions: Much like off-topic discussions, distractions at the table should be minimized. This includes laptop computers, tablets, phones, music players, TVs, and anything else that draws the players’ attention from the game. • Table Talk and Metagame Discussion: Some­ times even game-related discussions can be a dis­ traction. During game play, particularly combat, players often attempt to coordinate their character’s actions. While some planning is acceptable, talk in the middle of a combat round should be discour­ aged if their characters are not in a situation that allows it. A secondary problem occurs when a player suggests actions to another player. While this can be helpful to new players, it can lead to unrealistic coor­ dination. It may irritate other players at the table if it occurs every session. See Player Knowledge vs. Character Knowledge on page 294 • Note Passing: There may be times when a char­ acter wants to act on knowledge that no other Player Character has, and he wants to conceal his actions. The player and CM may pass notes to each other to secretly progress that part of the storyline. Less common is note passing be­ tween players, bypassing the CM. Both are gen­ erally acceptable, but the CM should be careful to not let it dominate the game or overly frus­ trate players left out of the loop. GROUP DYNAMICS There are two major group dynamics in play at the gaming table. One is between the players, while the second is between their characters. Both are im portant to having fun during the game. Ideally, the players enjoy playing with each other, and their characters have enough in common to as­ sociate with each other w ithout large amounts of tension. Disruptions to either of these cases can diminish the fun of playing. WHEN THE PARTY DISAGREES Roleplaying is highly situational. As a story unfolds, the party often debates the desired course of action. This normally works itself out as the party discusses its options. Disagreements due to roleplaying indi­ vidual characters can be great moments in the game. However, if a disagreement grows to the point that it disrupts the fun of the game, it’s usually a good time to take a break. Breaks may last just a few minutes or suspend the game until the next session. Sometimes, the CM can alter the in-game situation enough to provide a more obvious or agreeable path forward. Compromise from the CM or other players to move the story along is normally acceptable and de­ sirable, especially if the situation makes one or more players uncomfortable at the table. The party should be careful to avoid lingering disagreements, as they can lead to bad feelings and possibly break up the group. WHEN THE PARTY SPLITS UP Sometimes the best course of action is for the party to split up in the game. This normally happens when the action is spread out, and the party needs to be in more than one place at the same time. This can also be used to diffuse situations in which the party greatly disagrees on the correct course of action. No matter the cause, splitting the party also splits the attention of the CM. This naturally focuses the CM’s at­ tension on one part of the group at a time, leaving the rest to wait until the spotlight returns to them. The CM must be careful not let too much downtime pass between groups. In some cases, the players might physically sepa­ rate from the table and go to different rooms or areas, to avoid overhearing or disrupting a scene that their char­ acters are not part of and cannot influence. See Player Knowledge vs. Character Knowledge on page 294 Splitting the party is acceptable and expected for limited durations. It is least disruptive to the game as a whole if the CM keeps all players at the table. Splitting the party for longer-term situations can add to the story, but must be carefully managed. The GM might even consider running separate sessions in extreme cases. INTRODUCING NEW PLAYER CHARACTERS B ringing a new player into an existing group can be exciting. It is often necessary to replace play­ ers who leave during a long campaign. A new char­ acter shakes up the group dynamics, and brings out new or unexpected opportunities within the game. However, not all additions go smoothly, and considerations should be made regarding the sto­ ryline and the enjoyment of the group as a whole. Before adding a new player, the group should discuss whether that person meshes well with the current game and group. The CM could discreetly discuss the situation with each player to minimize hurt feelings if some players object to the new person. When the new player arrives at the table, the group and CM should bring him up to speed on the current story, table rules, and any house rules in use (House rules are game rules created by the CM for unusual situations, or personal preference). When the new character arrives in game, there should be an accompanying story reason for him to join the group. The CM can create it, but it works best when it includes ideas from the new player and the existing group. The new character may be a friend, relative, or associate of the Player Char­ acters, or he might be introduced by an NPC. An adventure specifically created to introduce the Player Character is a good way to integrate the new character with the existing campaign. If the new player is also new to Edce of the Empire or RPCs in general, he may need help learning the rules and terminology. While the GM can and should aid him, it is often better for a player to act as a men­ tor. This frees the CM to concentrate on the game and the entire group, while the individual player gets specific advice or instructions about how to use the game mechanics at their required times. Seating the new player next to the mentor minimizes disruptions from rules discussions during the game. WHEN THE PARTY GOES OFF THE RAILS One of the great attractions players have to roleplay­ ing games is the freedom to play their characters as they see fit. The players will almost always push the story in unexpected but perfectly logical directions. One of the joys and responsibilities of the CM is to keep the story moving when the unexpected happens. Sometimes, the party’s actions completely depart from the story. How strictly the CM tries to keep to the envisioned storyline depends on the CM's philosophy. Most allow the characters to pursue their own course for a while, inserting clues, new NPCs, or events that eventually bring them back to the planned plot. More freewheeling CMs might completely jettison their sto­ ryline and react to the character’s new actions and goals. Flexibility within the story is one key to great gaming sessions. Neither approach is wrong, unless the players become unhappy with the outcome. PLANNING GAME SESSIONS Planning each game session takes time and effort. While some CMs create highly detailed outlines and plans, others run their games free-form, with mini­ mal notes. Each GM eventually settles on a method that works for him, with the time he has. Different as­ pects of game planning rise and fall in importance as the GM’s style, proficiency, and storytelling develop. The novice GM should start with the guidance given earlier about the first session and then integrate the following advice when the game or story requires it. STYLE OF PLAY Different groups and CMs enjoy different ways of play­ ing the game. The GM should be aware of his group’s preferences, and prepare sessions that enhance, if not cater to, their expectations. The GM should still feel free to use other play styles if a specific scene or en­ counter warrants it. The major play styles are Combat Focused vs. Exploration and Storytelling. Many CMs settle on a combination of the two, alternating be­ tween story-based sessions and combat-intensive play. Combat-focused play concentrates more on the tac­ tical moments of the game. Fighting and combat use a significant portion of play time, limiting the depth and complexity of other scenes. The players gener­ ally like battling their foes directly by outsmarting or overwhelming adversaries on the battlefield. Combat is expected to be part of nearly every session. Exploration and storytelling focuses more on the overall plot, and the characters’ interaction with the fantastic locations, events, and adversaries of the larger Star Wars universe. Entire sessions or more may pass without firing a single blaster. Conflict comes more from the environment and NPC plans and reactions than dodging fire. Plot lines may be more intricate, or tie into character backstories to a much greater degree. STORYTELLING The core of every roleplaying game is the storyline. The Player Characters are the main actors in a plot of the CM’s devising. The complexity and depth of the story depends greatly on the desires of the gaming group as a whole. A good story is an entertaining one, not necessarily the most complex. The GM needs to create at least a basic plot for the adventure he wants to run (or understand it when using a published ad­ venture). He should take ideas from the Player Character’s backgrounds to tie them closely into the sto­ ryline. For example, a character’s THAT STAR WARS FEELING A crucial aspect of running a Star Wars game is making it feel like something seen on the mov­ ie or TV screen. The game and plot should be fast paced and entertaining, have a dash of humor, and feature moments of high drama or tension. The GM should limit or avoid plots that run counter to expectations. Horror, for instance, is not normally a part of the core Star Wars experience. Gruesome scenes explained in graphic detail are not expected. That isn't to say they could never be used—there are oc­ casional graphic moments in the movies—but they should not be the norm. It is also worth noting that the Expanded Universe (official books and stories outside of the movies and TV shows) touches on a wider range of storytelling elements, such as horror. GMs wanting to explore similar ideas might look to them for inspiration while keeping the Star Wars feel. GMs should also give the play­ ers an indication that their story may address non-traditional Star Wars themes, so they are not caught off guard once play begins. response to an attacking pirate might be quite different if the pirate turns out to be a relative or hated enemy. Unexpected revelations, conflicts of interest, and more increase the complexity, and potential enjoyment, of the plot. See Making an Edce of the Empire Adventure on page 302 and Running a Full Campaign on page 317 for more detail on creating adventures. SOURCES OF INSPIRATION The Star Wars Expanded Universe is enormous. With over 35 years of movies, comics, novels, games, source books, TV shows, and more, there is a vast wealth of information for GMs to draw upon when cre­ ating their own games. Of course, the Star Wars game lines from Fantasy Flight Games will continue to grow, providing rules and adventures for a variety of play experiences. However, GMs should feel free to draw upon any Star Wars publication or other source for story ideas. Many also provide great visual references at the game table. RUNNING THE GAME Running the game means more than managing the story. The GM must also attend to the mechanical means of keeping the game going. This section pro­ vides guidance on how to handle specific rules and other elements during the game session itself, and how they interact. RULES ADJUDICATION The GM is the final arbiter of all rules discussions. It is important that he listens to the players’ arguments for their side of an interpretation. Rules discussions should not dominate playing time. The GM should make a ruling to keep the game moving and review the rule in detail later. If the ruling was incorrect, the GM may try to make it up to the player or group in question in a future session, or simply acknowledge the mistake and chalk it up as a lesson learned. Sometimes the GM feels the rules are unclear or he has an unusual situation. The GM may create a house rule to address the issue. However, the GM might also gain further insight from discussing the issue with other GMs or rules-proficient players, in person or on online gaming forums. However, rules lawyering—us­ ing the minutiae of the rules to gain an unfair, unex­ pected, or unintended advantage in game—should be avoided by both players and GMs. PLAYER KNOWLEDGE VS. CHARACTER KNOWLEDGE Players generally know a lot more about a given situ­ ation than the characters they are playing. It is im­ portant that they differentiate between information learned outside of the game, and information that their characters are aware of. To aid in the suspension of disbelief, players should not use information their characters cannot logically know within the game. This is particularly true when the party is split, with characters in different locations. For ease of play, the GM may allow all players to remain at the table while they play their individual scenes. However, the unin­ volved players should not have their characters act on any information gained by listening to the interaction between the GM and the rest of the group. Additionally, players may know a great deal about the Star Wars universe. While the use of such knowl­ edge can add great details to the game, players must be careful not to use information their characters do not know about the universe or political situation. It is highly unlikely, for instance, for the characters to know the intimate history of Darth Vader, despite his depic­ tion in the movies and elsewhere. INTERPRETING THE DICE POOL One of the GM’s primary responsibilities is to interpret the results of die rolls. Given that the exact makeup of each dice pool varies wildly, it gives the GM and the players many opportunities to translate the results into narrative effects. During the heat of the game, the play­ ers may rapidly assess the roll for only success or fail­ ure, then quickly pick up the dice for the next roll. The GM should discourage this, especially if the story is at a critical juncture. While not every die roll needs extent­ sive interpretation, important moments should always be influenced by the dice results. The die symbols generated by each check go well beyond the simple task of indicating success or fail­ ure. Success indicated by a O can mean something different than if it occurs on an <0 or Q In this case, it might indicate the character’s skill overcame all other challenges. If the same result occurred using a n fortune may have stepped in at the right mo­ meant. The CM should inform the story via the dice whenever possible. □ and ■ indicate the influence of fortune and mis­ fortune in the results. Failure indicates that the in­ herent difficulties in the situation, terrain, or task at hand were too much to overcome. Success indicates that luck, the Force, or a beneficial circumstance af­ fected the outcome. USING STAR WARS CANON (OR NOT) O ne interesting aspect of the Star Wars uni­ verse is, generally speaking, almost every­ thing that is officially published is considered part of the official history. Anything officially licensed but not produced directly by Lucas- film (i.e. outside of the movies and TV shows) is referred to as the EU, or Expanded Universe. With 35 years of material and counting, it is a huge resource for newcomers to get a handle on a universe that spans thousands of years. When running a Star Wars game, the CM should decide early on whether he is going to stick with Star Wars canon as his stories devel­ op. In most cases, it is not a big issue. If the sto­ ryline does not involve notable characters and events from official stories, the game plot may peacefully coexist with the universe at large. Flowever, some GMs and players feel con­ strained by the knowledge that their heroes aren’t the center of the universe, or are un­ able to affect certain galactic events. It is the CM ’s prerogative to use as much or as little Star Wars canon he feels comfortable with. If the CM wants to run a game based on an al­ ternate version of events, or one where known events can come out differently, that is per­ fectly acceptable. Flowever, he should inform his players. 0 and ^ represent the battle between a character’s natural abilities and knowledge versus the inherent difficulty of the task at hand. Failure indicates that the task was just too hard to accomplish this time around. O and # represent the character’s trained skill versus the most difficult challenges. Similar to the ( ) and success indicates that the character’s train­ ing has prevailed, while failure indicates that the cir­ cumstances were just too difficult to surpass. O and <§> indicators are often less clear-cut in their influence on the dice pool. Sometimes, they may trig­ ger certain abilities or effects built into talents or spe­ cial abilities. More often, they give the GM or player the opportunity to describe how the results place the character in a better or worse position than before the action. ($) and ^ indicators should generate excitement at the game table. indicates a critical success, which should also grant the character an advantage in the scene. ^ indicates a critical failure, which should disrupt the character and make the situation much worse. Usually, the makeup of the dice pool does not evenly align dice types that are in direct opposition to each other. Instead, &, T and other indicators will be spread across different dice in different amounts. It will often be up to the CM to decide which of the # or Y is relevant to the story interpretation. USING BOOST & SETBACK DICE Boosts and Setbacks are basic GM tools for manipu­ lating fortune and misfortune in the game. Beyond the normal guidelines for setting difficulty within the dice pool, □ and ■ enable the CM to allow characters to try unusual or insane ideas during play. The players enjoy the chance to try creative solutions within the game, and the GM can regulate the difficulty through the addition of more ■ , instead of saying no to the idea. Note that □ and ■ are not normally upgraded to other die types. Alternatively, the □ may be used to reward a Player Character for good planning or creative thinking. They may also be used in situations not covered by the rules. If the Player Character comes up with a good idea and the GM wants to allow it, he may add Q This is espe­ cially encouraged if the idea is in keeping with the spirit of the Star Wars movies and stories. USING STRAIN Strain is a non-lethal way for characters to suffer physical and psychological effects beyond wounds and significant injuries. See page 31 for a complete description of strain. For the GM, strain represents an opportunity to add mechanical emphasis and conse­ quences to narrative aspects of the scene or combat. In combat, strain effects dictated by the CM should be limited to give the players the opportunity to voluntarily suffer strain for an additional maneuver or to use talents. DICE POOL EVALUATION: SUCCESS W|h a t do the following dice pool results have in common? Each of these dice pools indicates a success­ ful check. At least one uncanceled Success sym­ bol appears in each pool. Assume that this pool represents a smuggler attacking a stormtrooper. Below are interpretations of these results. Dice Pool 1-Success with a Slight Advan­ tage: The & appearing on the <0 are cancelled by the T showing on one 0 and one Q One of the O O on the next <0 is cancelled by the single <§> showing on the second <$>. One O remains showing on the <>, and & appears on the # . The smuggler’s superior shooting skill has bested the storm trooper’s arm or and training, leaving the smuggler in a slightly ad­ vantageous position. "Your quick shot strikes the stormtrooper, leav­ ing a smoking hole in his armor. You think you'll have no trouble sliding behind cover as he reels from the hit.” Dice Pool 2 —Successful but Vulnerable: The O on the 0 is cancelled by the <§) showing on one 0 and the & on one # is cancelled by the y on the other <>. The remaining # shows one # , but the two □ each have uncanceled <§> The smuggler's shot grazes the stormtrooper, who remains well protected by his defenses and ready to retaliate. "Your shot penetrates the foliage concealing the stormtrooper, but only grazes him. He re­ mains difficult for you to see and hit, and you aren't sure where his next shot will come from." Dice Pool 3-1 Have You Now: The & and O of the ■ are cancelled by the T on one 0 and the <§> on the Q The two O of the first 0 are can­ celed by the two <§> of the other {>. The remaining <0> die shows # and O and the # shows a I The smuggler beats relentlessly on the cornered storm- trooper, striking a staggering blow despite the stor­ mtrooper’s armor. “You trap the stormtrooper between the speeder and the wall, inhibiting his movement and catching him below the chin. The solid hit knocks his helmet off. leaving him alive but completely stunned. DICE POOL EVALUATION: FAILURE g il h a t do the following dice pool results w h a v e in common? Dice Pool 5 -F e a r Keeps You In Line: The first 0 shows # and O countered by the first 0 showingY and <§) The second 0 shows O cancelled by <§> from the second 0 . The # shows & . but is countered by the □ showing a ▼ One uncanceled <§) symbol remains on the second <), and the O shows The smuggler fails a fear check when he is surprised by the sudden ap­ pearance of Boba Fett at his ship’s hatch. “As you head for the hatch, you catch sight of Boba Fett blocking your way, blaster drawn. The surprise appearance shocks you completely. You stand there frozen, momentarily unable to move or go for your gun." Each of these dice pools indicates an unsuc­ cessful check. No uncanceled Success symbol appears in any pool. Assume that the first two pools represent a smuggler encountering a bound­ ty hunter. The last represents a standard skill check. Below are interpretations of these results. Dice Pool 4 - N o t So Sneaky: The ■ is showing # and O but is canceled by the □ showing <§> and the 0 showing Y The <Q> shows O but is canceled by <§> showing on the O . The # shows blank. The O shows one uncanceled Y . The smuggler fails to sneak past the bounty hunter. “You try to sneak past the bounty hunter sen­ try on the hill. The fog density negates his height advantage, but he's smart enough to realize that. You try to sneak behind some debris, but you knock it over and he spots you anyway." Dice Pool 6 -H a rd e r Than It Looks: The 0 showing Y and <§> cancels both § . One uncan­ celed <§> remains on the Q The smuggler fails to climb a rough wall in a driving rainstorm. “As you try to climb the wall, you realize the rain has made it far slicker than it looks. You fail to make any headway, and your first a t­ tem pt has loosened the few decent handholds this far down.” Extreme environments or circumstances may occasion­ ally increase the amount of strain the GM inserts into the encounter. Environmental strain should be less of a con­ cern during the average combat. In scenes outside of combat, strain adds weight to environmental effects. Enduring long periods of expo­ sure to heat, cold, radiation or unusual weather like sandstorms may cause strain. Psychological pressure may also induce strain. This kind of strain may come from strong emotional reactions to loss, extreme an­ ger, frustration, or another reaction that distracts a character from the task at hand. Obligation, when triggered in a game session, inflicts strain on the affected characters (see page 41). The GM should provide narrative descriptions demonstrating how the Obligation is affecting the character, thus producing the strain. Strain from Obligation is typically an emotional effect, from the stress of dealing with the circumstances producing or resulting from a character’s Obligation. When assigning strain, the GM should consider how all of the different sources may interact in an encounter or scene. Creating a scene in which strain is a primary com­ ponent is perfectly fine, but having a scene accidentally overwhelmed with strain can alter the narrative in unex­ pected ways. Typically, the GM should assign one or two points of strain for a given effect. Environmental effects may inflict strain, and the amount of strain inflicted can serve as an indication as to how dangerous the effect is. USING FEAR The galaxy is filled with frightful creatures and situa­ tions. Wild creatures like the savage rancor lurk in dis­ tant wildernesses or suddenly appear in surprising plac­ es such as Jabba the Hutt’s dungeon. Sith and followers of the dark side use fear as motivation and wield it as a weapon against their enemies. War, combat, in- J timidating adversaries, and environmental hazards may instill fear in anyone, anywhere. Fear inter­ feres with character actions and goals. It may S reduce a character's effectiveness, make him .• hesitate, or even cause him to flee. Within the game, fear is countered by the Discipline skill (see page 110) and occasionally the Cool skill (see page 108). Like any other skill check, the GM sets the difficulty and adds the appropriate dice to the character's dice pool. Interpreting the dice pool results is key to deter­ mining the effects of fear, even on a successful roll. The Discipline or Cool skill check represents the character’s ability to act in the face of fear, not necessarily the level of fear a character may feel. EX AM PLE A character is afraid of heights. A successful Discipline check means he overcomes the fear to act while crossing a high, narrow bridge w ithout railings...this tim e around. Next time, he might not be so lucky and freeze or stumble while making the attempt. W HEN TO MAKE A FEAR CHECK Any time Discipline or Cool is used to counter fear, it is called a fear check. Not every frightening situa­ tion requires a fear check. They should be restricted to unusual circumstances or the first time a charac­ ter experiences a particularly frightening situation. A pirate fighting stormtroopers probably doesn’t need to make a check. If Darth Vader comes around the corner and the pirate has never seen him personally, a check is appropriate. The frequency of fear checks is determined by the GM. Typically, once a fear check is rolled, the GM should not require another check for the same source during the same encounter, unless the circumstances significantly change. The GM might require more fear checks in a story where fear is a key element. A char­ acter who is constantly afraid of losing his ship or a TABLE 9-1: FEAR GUIDELINES State of Fear Check DiPficulty Example Minimally Afraid Easy(4) Somewhat overmatched in combat; a minimally dangerous creature; a minor threat to one's safety. Moderately Afraid Average (44 ) Obviously overmatched in combat; a dangerously aggressive creature; a credible threat to one's safety and minimal threat to one’s life. Very Afraid Hard (444 ) Battlefield combat; a pack of aggressive creatures; a major threat to one's safety and moderate fear for one's life. Mortally Afraid Daunting (4444 ) Terrifyingly intense combat; confronting a large and dangerous creature such as a rancor; overwhelming fear for one’s life. Utterly Terrified Formidable (444 44 A hopeless and utterly terrifying situation; combat against things incomprehensible to one's mind; being chased by a pack of rancors; fear so crippling that sanity cracks.

Confronting something known to be dangerous and very rare. 2 difficulty upgrades Being trapped in the gullet of a Sarlacc. Confronting something known to be extremely dangerous and unique. 3 difficulty upgrades Fighting Darth Vader. loved one might be required to make more checks to reflect his ongoing concern and stress. Typically, the effects of fear are determined by the results of a Discipline check. However, if the character has had time to prepare for the situation, and is not taken by surprise, the CM may allow the character to use a Cool check instead. DETERM INING FEAR DIFFICULTY The difficulty of a fear check is a com bination of circumstance and the individual experiencing the fear. No two people respond the same way to a frightening situation. Where an untrained civilian might freeze in fear when a fight breaks out, a trained soldier may act with confidence and effec­ tiveness. This is not to say that the solider is nec­ essarily unafraid; it simply means that he is better able to deal with the fear. Example circumstances and difficulties are shown in Table 9 -1 : Fear Guidelines. The difficulty is ini­ tially set reflecting a frightening situation for a person without prior experience in the events in question. The difficulty of the check can also be upgraded, de­ pending on the circumstances at hand. Upgrades usu­ ally depend on the circumstances of the check or the details of the creature or character causing the fear. For example, confronting a grim warrior in black ar­ more and carrying a lightsaber could at the very least be a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) check. However, know­ ing that the warrior is Darth Vader, who hunted down and killed the Jedi and is a Dark Lord of the Sith, can upgrade the difficulty of the check three times. The GM may add ■ to represent other aspects of the situ­ ation, such as surprise. The GM may also add □ and other beneficial dice if the character’s resolve is sup­ ported by powerful allies or other beneficial aids. EFFECTS OF FEAR The GM should interpret the results of the dice pool. Some creatures or talents may dictate the re­ sults of a fear check they specifically trigger. The GM may also create additional effects. <§> and O carry effects regardless of success and failure. If multiple fear checks are needed, <§> and O of later rolls may cancel out effects from earlier rolls. Suggested minimum failure effects are: • Failure: The character adds ■ to each action he takes during the encounter. • Threat: The character suffers a number of strain equal to the number of Failures. If the check gen­ erates <§> <§) <o> or more, the character can be staggered for his first turn, instead. • Despair: The character is incredibly frightened and increases the difficulty of all checks until the end of the encounter by one. TABLE 9-Z: SPENDING EXPERIENCE Suggested success interpretations are: • Success or m ultiple Successes: The charac­ ter avoids any fear effects, except those trig ­ gered by <§>. • Advantage: Cain □ on the character's first check. If spending multiple O grant □ to an ad­ ditional player’s first check. • Triumph: Can be spent to cancel all previous pen­ alties from fear checks, or spent to ensure the char­ acter need not make any additional fear checks during the encounter, no matter the source. CHARACTER DEATH Character death is a part of the Star Wars universe, and this game is no different. While death is unlikely to hap­ pen in most game sessions, the threat of death builds tension into the game session. How a player reacts to his character's demise depends largely on the player. Some take it in stride, and are soon ready to create a new one. Other players may be disappointed, upset, or angry, es­ pecially those who invested a good deal of time and effort into the character. They may be particularly frustrated if the character death is meaningless, cheap, or feels un­ fair. While the CM may try to prevent a character death through subtle or obvious means, such aid should be backed up by solid reasoning. Perceived favoritism in the CM’s handling of different deaths between different Play­ er Characters can lead to hurt feelings and angry players. PLAYING THE ROLE CMs should always remember that they are playing the role of NPCs motivated by their own desires, fears, rela­ tionships, and orders. How far the GM goes in portraying and performing the character depends on the CM’s com­ fort level in acting out the role. It is perfectly acceptable to speak in third person, such as "The crime lord tells you to take your money and never come back." However, it is more engaging and immersive to perform a voice or accent and speak directly to the characters. The same line might be delivered as “Here, scum, take your pre­ cious credits and get out. If you ever come back, I'll feed you to the rancor.” Most CMs use a mixture of these two approaches. However, if the GM’s performance elicits un­ intended laughter in a dramatic situation, it is probably time to consider a different approach. IMPROVISING Becoming a good CM requires a number of improvisa- tional skills, which are used throughout the game session. Improvisational acting occurs when the GM plays the role of NPCs reacting to character questions and actions. Im- USING MUSIC AND PROPS O ne of the great advantages of running a game in the Star Wars setting is the availability of music. The movie soundtracks add instant atmo­ sphere to a game session. Beginning an adven­ true with the opening fanfare and Main Title score instantly sets an unmistakable tone. Running the soundtracks at low volume in the background of the game session can add ambience. A better approach is to play selected tracks at the proper moments to add to the situation at hand. North­ ing fills the players with a bit of apprehension and says, “The Empire is here” like playing The Imperi­ al March just before announcing a Star Destroyer has arrived to ruin their day. With the multitude of Star Wars toys, mod­ els, replicas, and other products, it is also easy to use props during the game. Starships models, books with detailed pictures, and toy weapons can be adapted for use at the table, or serve as an example. However, not all toys set the appro­ priate mood. A highly accurate X-wing model can add interesting details to an in-game discussion about the craft. A preschooler's version of the same X-wing won’t have the same effect. Options Cost Prerequisites May spend experience to purchase ranks in any skill, up to rank 5. Career skills cost five tim es the purchased rank in experience. Non-Career skills cost five times the purchased rank in experience, plus 5 additional experience. W hether Career skills or non-Career skills, each rank must be purchased sequentially (so rank 2 must be purchased before rank 3, and so on).

Non-Career specializations cost 10 additional experience. None. provisational story changes occur regularly, as the CM makes constant behind-the-scenes adjust­ ments in order to keep the plot moving forward. If the characters move in an unexpected yet logical direction, the CM must be able to improvise new scenes or characters on the fly. Fortunately, these skills improve with time and practice. AWARDING EXPERIENCE POINTS The CM should award experience points after ev­ ery session. The amount awarded is typically 10 to 20 XP per character for a session of two or three major encounters and a handful of minor ones. An additional 5 XP bonus may be granted for reaching key milestones or completing story arcs. Playing to a character’s Motivation also grants 5 XP per session at the GM's option. The CM may consider awarding an extra point or two of XP for excep­ tional roleplaying or highly clever thinking. Pub­ lished adventures may recommend XP awards. The CM should give the players an idea of the source of their XP. For example, they may receive - 5 XP for avoiding a bounty hunter and another 5 XP for successfully transporting their cargo to their client. Any bonus XP that is awarded should defi­ nitely be explained to the players so they may as­ pire to those standards in future sessions. SPENDING EXPERIENCE POINTS When awarding experience, the CM should keep in mind what his players will be able to spend experience points on and how much^it costs. This is covered on page 92, but reprint­ ed here in Table 9 -2 : Spending Experience for convenience. This only covers spending experience after character creation. MANAGING RECORDS & DOWNTIME Between sessions, the GM and the players will find it helpful to maintain certain records. The CM should track XP and award it as needed. The CM should also alter the group's current Obligation as needed. The players should update their character sheets, particu­ larly if they increase their abilities or need to adjust their listed equipment. It is also helpful if the CM or a player keeps a journal or notes about each session. This makes it easier to remember the events of the sto­ ry so far and track the movements or names of NPCs. Not every new adventure picks up immediately where the previous one leaves off. Most should include down­ time for the characters. This allows them to gain needed training and carry out tasks that don’t need to be played out at the table. For instance, a smuggler might make several uneventful runs between adventures. There is no need to play out mundane events. The CM and players should be ready to summarize what has occurred during the downtime between adventures. FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENT Constructive feedback is critical for GMs, particularly new GMs, to learn what they can do to improve the game- play for everybody. The GM should ask for feedback after every few sessions, or after a particularly difficult or dull game. Feedback may be taken as a group at the table, but many players find it easier to discuss difficult situations one on one with the GM. Feedback may re­ veal issues mishandled by the CM or players. However, feedback more commonly helps the CM alter his game to better fit player expectations, or vice versa. CREATING AN EDGE OF THE EMPIRE ADVENTURE A dventures are the core of each game session. Creating new adventures can be one of the most exciting and enjoyable aspects of becoming a Game Master. Creating an interesting story that is also fun and mechanically balanced is challeng­ ing. This section will help the CM create his own adventures, specifically ones that are them atically appropriate for Edge of the Em pire EDGE OF THE EMPIRE VS. OTHER STA R W ARS ADVENTURES E dge of the Em p ir e is a publication focused on the tougher and g rittie r aspects of living and w ork­ ing in the fringes of the galaxy. The tim e frame follows the in itia l successes of the Rebel Alliance against the Empire in S tar Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, but before the battles at Hoth and En- dor. Smugglers, bounty hunters, scouts, and o th ­ ers th a t work at the edges of civilized space and/ or the edges of legality are the central theme of these adventures. Stories featuring the struggle between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire, or the Jedi, will be addressed in detail in upcoming supplements. USING PUBLISHED ADVENTURES Using published adventures gives the CM a prime example of how an Edge of the Em pir e style ad­ venture works. It also allows players from d iffe r­ ent gaming groups to have shared experiences, allowing them to compare how an adventure de­ veloped and differences in th e ir final outcomes. However, while published adventures are useful, the GM will likely find he needs to create his own adventures to extend the story or bridge gaps be­ tween official adventures. ASSEMBLING THE CAST Every episode, adventure, and story needs a cast of memorable characters. Sometimes, the major characters are outlined first, with the story devel­ oping around th eir goals and actions. Sometimes the p lo t comes first, generating characters to fulfill certain roles or cover aspects of the story. Usually, the characters and p lo t are developed together and com plem ent each other. ADVENTURE HOOKS T he following are a number of brief suggestions for adventure hooks to get a CM started in their game. The CM may expand on these sample Edge of the Empire adventure ideas: • The Player Characters use smuggling, bounty hunting, and mercenary missions to pay off a large debt to a crime lord. • The Player Characters run contraband into an Imperial system, city, or starport. • The Player Characters smuggle ryll spice from Ryloth (the Twi’lek homeworld) to Tatooine or a central Imperial world. • The Player Characters must protect a re­ mote outpost from pirates and raiders. • The Player Characters are mistaken for Rebel sympathizers by Imperial agents or local law enforcement, and must deal with the consequences. • The Player Characters are scouts, hired by some entity to explore specific star systems, Wild Space, or the Unknown Regions. They might run across a hidden Imperial base, a criminal hideout, a new species, or a starship crash site. • The Player Characters become caught up in an Imperial attack or reprisals on a world of questionable loyalties, The Player Characters must escape, help oth­ ers escape, or take a side in the conflict. • The Player Characters' ship is attacked by pirates while en route to a remote locale. STOCK NPCS Stock NPCs are the unnamed masses the Player Char­ acters encounter, battle, and negotiate with in most game sessions. They are often minions and rivals (See Chapter XII: Adversaries, page 389). Stock NPCs in an Edge of the Empire adventure include the av­ erage stormtrooper, fellow smugglers, the inevitable customs agent, and so on. Many stock NPCs don't even need statistics, or can rely on standard stats pro­ vided in this publication or others. Stock NPCs usually don’t have much of a backstory, or at least not one that directly influences the adventure. They are usu­ ally short term contacts or adversaries. RECURRING CHARACTERS Recurring characters are those that the Player Char­ acters encounter on a regular basis. They usually have names, and often the CM will create specific stats for each. Recurring characters might be enemies or adversaries of the Player Characters. They can be anything from the main customs agent at the play­ ers' favorite starport, to major villains out to get them. They are typically rivals or nemesis adversaries (See Chapter XII: Adversaries, page 390). Recurring characters help make the galaxy a more familiar place. They also save the CM a lot of planning time. It's much easier to rely on an old favorite charac­ ter than come up with a new one for every session. The GM should find ways to integrate them into the storyline. Turning background characters into leading characters is a way to build a more layered and interesting story. It may also en- courage the players to take a greater interest in other recurring characters. FAMOUS CHARACTERS Star Wars is filled with interesting characters, famous within the galaxy far, far away. Not all of the characters made famous by the movies are actually well known within the galaxy itself. Everyone in the galaxy prob­ ably knows who Darth Vader is. Fewer will recognize Chewbacca or a cer­ tain pair of common­ looking droids. The GM may use famous characters at his discretion. Part of this decision will be based on the GM’s thoughts towards maintaining official continuity (see the Using S t a r W a r s Canon (Or Not) sidebar on page 295). Some characters are better than others at literally and figuratively surviving encounters with the Player Charac­ ters. If the CM wants to maintain continuity, it is not a good idea to place major movie characters in situations where the PCs could logically endanger them. However, using recognizable characters is a great way to increase the Star Wars feeling of the game session Being hauled before Jabba the Hutt elevates a scene in the players’ minds, while adding layers of tension and information not easily conveyed with a new or lesser known NPC. A common method of including higher pro­ file characters from the movies or other sources is to have them issue missions or hire the Player Characters to fulfill specific re­ quests. The char­ acter might also deal with the PCs from beyond their immediate reach, such as via ho­ lographic communications or view screens. GMs should also know that the novelty wears off quickly, so it’s best to limit such encounters to special occasions. CREATING MEMORABLE ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES Creating an entertaining and memorable ally or en­ emy is challenging. As such a character greatly en­ gages the Player Characters, it is usually worth the extra effort. Ideally, players should enjoy interacting with the character and recall them fondly well after the game is over. There is no single formula for creating a successful character. Books and other resources that discuss char­ acters in novels and stories are equally helpful when re­ searching better character creation. However, there are character elements every GM can start with: • Select the character’s species. Most species have distinct background or physical elements that enhance or limit their role in the game. A Hutt isn’t likely to engage in a lightsaber duel, for instance. There is no single species inherent to an Edce of the Empire style adventure. Most any species can find themselves on the wrong side of galactic events or the law. • Select the character’s most influential home- world and what they learned from it. Even characters who move around the galaxy are influ­ enced by the attitudes or environment from their original or current home planet. • Select the character’s profession and former professions. Especially focus on how the character’s profession influences his current actions. Even NPCs have a past exploitable by the GM or the players. • Create the character’s personality. This is a wide open category. Personality traits run the gamut from arrogant and overbearing to kind and wise. Pick a few basic traits and highlight them when interacting with the Player Characters. Per­ sonalities for allies should have at least one re­ deeming feature. In Edge of the Em pire, allies can, and often should be, on the shady side. Enemies are commonly greedy and selfish, but these traits can be held in check for a while by loyalty or fear of their employer or leader. • Describe the character’s physical appear­ ance. Characters in Star Wars have no shortage of tattoos, cybernetics, distinctive armor, signa­ true clothing, scars, unusual hairstyles, and other memorable physical attributes. Major characters should have an immediately recognizable quality. • Develop the character’s “voice.” Selecting an accent, pitch, or tone of a character’s voice is a IN MEDIAS RES L atin for “ in the middle of things,” in medias res is the time-honored technique of start­ ing a story in the middle of the action. Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, immediately starts with a Star Destroyer pursuing and blasting away at the Rebel Blockade Runner. Similar techniques may be used to create an exciting start for a new adventure. The players are forced to deal with the immediate situa­ tion, before delving in the underlying issues that created it in the first place. The GM should consider combining in medi­ as res with the Obligation mechanic described later in this chapter. This idea throws the Play­ er Characters directly into an action-oriented encounter brought about by issues created by their starting Obligation. Bounty hunters might already be pursuing them or something in their smuggling compartment might decide to break its way out mid-flight. Maybe the Empire makes an example of the shadowport they are visiting by unleashing a Star Destroyer on the station. The action doesn't have to center on the Player Characters themselves; they might just be in the wrong place at the wrong time. crucial element in differentiating them from other characters. If the GM is not good or comfortable with accents or funny voices, he should at least describe the character’s voice from time to time. • Consider the character’s connection to the Force. While the Jedi and powerful Force users are not the focus of the Edge of the Em pire, char­ acters with lesser abilities can make for unexpected­ ed enemies and allies. • Outline how the character treats others. Plan not only how the NPC will interact with the Player Characters, but his or her friends and enemies as well. The NPC may not treat everyone the same or fairly, and the differences can reveal more lay­ ers of the character to the players. PRODUCING THE PLOT Creating a good adventure means concocting an en­ tertaining and plausible plot. Adventure ideas may come from innumerable sources, but it takes the GM to weave them into a playable game session. Compli­ cating matters is the fact that player actions alter the plot almost immediately. Since players have a habit of moving the story in unexpected directions, it falls to the GM to create an adventure adaptable to change, and to take multiple possible outcomes into account. THE STORY ARC Much like a novel or other story, an adventure story arc should contain a beginning, middle, and climac­ tic end. The beginning introduces the situation and the antagonists. The middle develops the events and the character actions. The end ties up the major plot points in a dramatic finish. BUILDING ENCOUNTERS Once the overall plot line and major characters are out­ lined, the GM should divide the major plot points into encounters. Adventures usually handle encounters in one of two ways. They can be highly linear in nature, with one encounter leading directly into the next, or they can be more free-form, with the next encounter dependent on the exact outcome of the one before it. Of the two types, the free-form variety allows for the most flexibility during the session. Highly linear adven­ tures run the risk of making the players feel like they’ve been railroaded into specific situations with no control over their own actions. Giving the players at least the illusion of free will is critical to maintaining the fun. PACING Star Wars adventures should be fast-paced. While there is a place for investigation, political intrigue, or slower events, they should be interspersed among chases, skirmishes, dra­ matic confrontation, and outright battle scenes. The GM should keep the action moving along at all times. Action doesn’t always mean outright combat. The GM should dispense with any en­ counter or scene that feels overly mundane, especially if it can be explained in a narrative. Star Wars adventures are often at their best if the GM' keeps the action fast-paced and' quick-moving. If the players are at a losses to how to proceed, the GM should feel free to give them just enough additional information to move them along to the next scene. If the players spend too long mulling over a certain situation or stalling out over a specific plot point, the GM can introduce something new to re­ act to. This could be as subtle as an intercepted mes­ sage from an adversary, or as blatant as thugs kicking down their door (metaphorically or literally). The other benefit of this is it makes the players feel like they are part of a larger world that moves forward even when they do not. LET THE PLAYERS SHINE C Ms must remember that the Player Char­ acters are the stars of the show. No matter how complex or exciting the plot, the Player Characters should always feel that they are the center of attention. Following this notion, each individual player should also enjoy moments of glory within an adventure. It is common for play­ ers to create characters focused on roles they enjoy playing, often with an effort to diversify the group and make sure all potential bases are covered. When crafting an adventure, the GM should build in moments for each of those char­ acter types, or specific characters, to signifi­ cantly contribute to the story. In short, give the players a chance to shine both in game and out. DRAMATIC ACTION Not every scene or encounter must involve high dra­ ma. However, major events should have a dramatic focus. The GM should create major moments that sig­ nificantly impact the overall storyline. The outcome of these encounters should have real consequences to the plot. The crime lord really will take their ship if the Player Characters don’t pay him back. The Empire really will throw the Player Characters in detention for a while if they’re caught smuggling. Most dra­ matically, their characters might not make it through this encounter alive. If the players are truly con­ cerned about the out­ come of the encounter and its effects on their characters, it quickly raises the level of dra­ ma in the scene. CONTROLLING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY Building a balanced and fair encounter is an exercise in controlling combat and environmental difficulties. While not every encounter needs to be a fair fight, most of the time, the Player Characters should have a decent chance of winning or escaping. Adversaries in combat encoun­ ters consist of minions, rivals, and nemeses (see Chap­ ter XII: Adversaries). When selecting adversaries, the GM must compare their attack skills and defenses with those of the Player Characters. If they use comparable dice, they are an appropriate individual opponent. If the Player Characters are outnumbered, their opponents should include more minions and rivals that are less of a threat individually, but are more effective in numbers. Individually, their combat abilities should be one or two dice lower than those of the Player Characters. Balancing narrative scenes is less of a concern. Me­ chanically, such scenes are usually focused on skill checks. The GM simply needs to confirm that any adversaries he selects have a roughly even chance of opposing the Player Characters’ skill checks. However, it is perfectly acceptable for opponents to have great­ er skill and abilities in these scenes, especially when dealing with beginning Player Characters. ENCOUNTER VARIETY Each adventure should feature a variety of encounter types. This gives a greater opportunity for characters of every type to contribute significantly to the story. Most adventures should be a mixture of combat, ro­ leplaying, exploration, and confrontation encounters. Some may mix in investigation, training, and other forms of play less common in the core Star Wars ex­ perience. Encounters should also vary in location and adversaries. See Running a Full Campaign on page 31 7 for additional encounter location ideas. DIRECTING THE SESSION An Edge of the E m pir e session should focus more on the g rittie r nature of dealing with the galaxy’s less savory places and people. While the Player Characters are free to be as heroic as they wish, they are more likely to be concerned about self- preservation and personal wealth than taking the battle to the Empire or freeing a planet of slaves. GMs should keep this distinction in mind when playing NPCs and especially when improvising new characters and situations on the fly. PRIOR TO START OF PLAY Character creation or adjustm ent should be com ­ pleted before the start of play. Obligation adjust­ ments should also be discussed and completed at this time. The CM rolls the Obligation check (see Using Obligation), and determines whether the group’s Obligation triggers, and if so, which player’s O bligation triggers specifically. He then decides whether he wants to bring up that Player Character’s O bligation in the adventure or simply let it prey on the minds of the players (not bringing up a character’s Obligation can often be a good dram atic tool, as it leaves the players a bit o ff bal­ ance and nervous. Keeping players from becoming com placent is usually a good idea). THE OPENING SCROLL Every S tar Wars movie starts with scrolling text th a t explains the imm ediate situation to the audi­ ence. It gives a little b it of context to the opening scene and foreshadows m ajor plot developments. The CM should w rite his own opening scroll for adventures he creates. It helps tie into the over­ all Star Wars feeling, and provides an easy intro ­ duction for the players. The CM should mimic the scroll style, lim iting the te xt to the bare bones of what is required to set up the opening scene. Star Wars-. Episode IV A New Hope does this in three long sentences. The CM should leave any descrip­ tions regarding the opening scene out of the scroll. Those descriptions should be part of the read- aloud te xt for after the scroll. SCREEN WIPES Star Wars movies use screen wipes to transition from scene to scene, jumping forward in time and/or chang­ ing locations. GMs can use metaphoric screen wipes to transition between encounters, especially if signifi­ cant time has passed. This can be used to cover long periods of travel, switch between groups in a party that has split up for a long period of time, and cover mundane actions that have no effect on the plot. ENDING THE SESSION Ending a session is different than ending the adven­ true. Ending a session occurs midstream, when the players do not have enough time to complete the adventure in one sitting. The players should note the current status of their characters, and jot down the exact situation they left to easily remind everyone where the game should pick up next time. Sessions are often ended on cliffhangers, to keep the suspense and excitement alive until the next session. The GM may decide to award XP for longer adventures. Oth­ erwise, he may elect to award it all at once, when the adventure is complete. ENDING THE ADVENTURE An adventure is typically finished once the major plot line is complete. If the adventure is part of a larger campaign, some subplots or story elements may carry over to the next adventure. Campaign story arcs typically span many adventures. The CM should award XP and grant other rewards at this time. Player Characters are free to advance their characters be­ tween adventures. USING OBLIGATION O bligation is a core narrative and game mechanic in Edce of the Empire (See page 38 for more information). Obligation influences both the charac­ ters and the adventure, often in unexpected ways. It can introduce new and unplanned alterations to the current circumstances. It also mechanically re­ inforces the concept that the universe responds to the characters’ actions and that their decisions mean something beyond both the GM’s and players’ im­ mediate control. GMs are encouraged to use Obligation creatively throughout the course of the adventure and cam­ paign. Since the Player Characters gain addition­ al XP by taking on extra Obligation, it is partly a player resource that should have a narrative or me­ chanical cost during the game. Players that took on extra Obligation should rightfully have to deal with more difficult situations than those players that kept their personal Obligation low. Obligation also provides a wealth of story hooks and roleplaying opportunities, influenced by the type of Obligation each Player Character has and when it is triggered. The CM should take every opportunity to use these hooks during the adventure or campaign. Published adventures may include suggested ties to certain types of Obligation. GUIDING STARTING OBLIGATION SELECTION During character creation, each player selects his Obligation type himself or by random chance (see page 38). Parties may end up with a wide va­ riety of Obligations, or a limited number of types shared between certain characters. The CM gener­ ally should not lim it the types of Obligations in a game but may work with the players if they want to use it to craft a specific, interesting backstory. The players should not be allowed to optimize or ma­ nipulate Obligation backgrounds to gain a substan­ tial benefit from it. Obligations are meant to grant a limited advantage in starting XP and/or equipment at the cost of hindrances and unexpected difficul­ ties within the game session. Alternatively, the GM (or players) may select or come up with new types of Obligation to fit a spe­ cific campaign or story arc. The Obligation may be the driving force behind an adventure or campaign, rather than a periodic problem. The CM should make sure that any Player Characters with Obligations less important to the plot are not forgotten, and are high­ lighted from time to time. USING THE OBLIGATION CHECK Before each game session, the CM makes an Obliga­ tion check (see page 41). The greater the group’s Obligation is, the greater the chance that it will come directly into play during that session. When triggered, the CM should note which player’s Obligation is acti­ vated, and note how that player’s specific Obligation type manifests itself. See the Obligation descriptions on page 39 for examples of how some specific Ob­ ligation types may influence events. The mechanical penalties of the Obligation check on some characters can be significant. A particularly painful result (rolling doubles) should have a major story impact during the session. If the Obligation af­ fects more than one character, the CM should con­ sider altering the plot for the session to reflect the sudden change. However, if the CM decides it would derail the story at a critical juncture, he can delay the actual encounter. The mechanical penalties should still remain in effect—perhaps the characters become informed of the impending problem and are still dis­ tracted and worried about it, even if (or because) they can’t immediately attend to the situation.

Government agencies will often attem pt to arrest on sight. Legendary in underworld circles or regions. Illegal sources o f equipm ent, vehicles, and weapons are available, b u t suppliers are wary o f the risk of angering a rival faction o r alerting the authorities, and may increase cost. USING THE OBLIGATION THRESHOLD The Obligation threshold indicates the group’s social standing and notoriety. It is the group’s total Obliga­ tion. Where the Obligation threshold number falls dic­ tates how difficult it might be for the Player Charac­ ters to talk with certain individuals, work with certain groups, and obtain legal or illegal equipment. Generally, the lower the number, the easier it is to deal with legitimate entities, such as governments, security forces, reputable shipyards, and individuals who are highly regarded. The higher the threshold, the greater the degree to which dealing with legiti­ mate entities becomes difficult, expensive, and often impossible. However, it may open up new opportuni­ ties when dealing with the underworld, black market, criminal groups, crime lords, and others who might not trust a more reputable individual or group. The effect of Obligation threshold numbers varies by region. Having a higher Obligation should hinder the characters more in the Core Worlds or Imperial space than the Outer Rim Territories or Hutt Space, for in­ stance. The GM should feel free to alter this to match the Player Characters specific Obligations, their circumstanc­ es, and the NPCs involved. Table 9 -3 : Group Obliga­ tion Threshold Guidelines lists ideas for threshold in­ terpretation and its influence while in Imperial-controlled space. Specific circumstances triggered by Obligation threshold may also be noted directly in an adventure. The GM also has the option to remove certain Obli­ gations from the group total when determining if a Group's total Obligation meets a certain threshold. The GM would most often do this if he decides a specific Obligation would not apply to a certain situation. EX AM PLE The GM is trying to decide if a local politician is going to meet with two of the PCs, Oskara and Lowhhrick. The group is at 65 total Obligation, which normally would make most politicians re­ fuse to meet with them publicly (see Table 9 -3 : Group Obligation Threshold Guidelines). However, the GM decides that Lowhhrick’s Oath Obligation, because it is a personal Oath to hunt down slavers that wronged his family, is not the sort of Obligation that would make the politician feel the Wookiee is a criminal. There­ fore, for the purposes of meeting this particular threshold, the GM decides the group’s total O b­ ligation only counts as 50, low enough that he’s comfortable with a quiet meeting. EX AM PLE: C O N T IN U E D In turn, the player controlling Oskara argues that her character’s Duty Obligation is to her home clan, and not to any underworld organizations, and probably shouldn’t count either. However, the GM notes that even though Oskara’s home clan isn’t an underworld organization, they do have ties to certain criminal enterprises. This is enough for the GM to feel that her Obligation does apply for the purposes of this threshold. MANAGING OBLIGATION RESOURCES Obligation is a powerful resource that may be spent and bargained with during the course of play. It gives the players an option beyond credits to obtain equipment or services they might otherwise be unable to acquire. However, unless the characters frequently ignore opportunities to reduce their Obligation, the GM can­ not normally force the players to take on additional Obligation beyond the start. The choice must be theirs, as an ex­ ercise in risk vs. reward. A character must weigh whether the advantage obtained will outweigh the draw­ backs. The GM should seek to craft interesting or compelling options so that the Player Character’s deci­ sion adds to the drama of the adventure. The flow of Obligation during a campaign is deter­ mined by three factors. The first is how much Obliga­ tion the characters start with. The more they start with, the more often it can come into play. The second is how often the players settle or take on new Obligation during the course of the game. If the Player Characters use it like credits, their Obligation will fluctuate regu­ larly. The third is how often the GM offers Obligation as an option during the session. The more opportunities the party has to gain and settle Obligation, the more they might utilize it. The GM must decide how often to insert Obligation offers into the game. Not every trip to the weapons store should include an opportu­ nity to gain Ob- ligation. Sometimes, the characters simply do not have the cash, and the proprietor isn’t interested in other options. However, when the characters need some­ thing important to the adventure, or they greatly desire something to improve their ship or personal situation, Obligation should be an obvious option. Gaining items or connections through Obligation should not be as simple as a picking something off of a menu. Typically, the characters must seek out alternative sources and make deals with them. The GM can exploit these con­ nections in future adventures via the Obligation check. The GM must also determine the value of the Obliga­ tion. There is no direct correlation between Obligation and the value of credits or specific services. It is subject­ tive and highly dependent on the current situation. Typi­ cally, the more dangerous the situation for the contact granting the party an item or connection, the higher the Obligation required. Rarity of items or access to indi­ viduals also play a role. Obligation may be assigned in any amount, but is typically 5 to 15 points. The type of Obligation should also be a factor. Most of the time, the GM should simply add on to a char­ acter’s existing Obligation type. However, some cir­ cumstances warrant the addition of a new Obligation type, such as blackmail, bounty, criminal, and debt. The GM should be careful not to overload a character with too many types of Obligation, usually maintain­ ing a maximum of three. MANAGING OBLIGATION SETTLEMENT Player Characters should have the opportunity to settle some Obligation at regular intervals, preferably given to a minimum of one Player Character once per adventure. Settlement may occur during an adventure, similarly to the way Obligation may be increased during the game. It may also occur at the end of or between adventures. EX AM PLE: SE TTLEM ENT BY PAYM ENT A ndy’s character sta rts w ith a D ebt O bliga­ tion of 10. The character owes 5 0 ,0 0 0 cred­ its. During an adventure, the p arty gets paid 10.000 credits, and they decide to apply it to A ndy’s character’s Debt O bligation. The GM may decide th a t each p o in t of Andy’s O b li­ gation is w orth 5 ,0 0 0 credits each. Paying 10.0 00 credits reduces the O bligation by 2, to a new score of 8. The GM could also rule th a t there is more to the O bligation than the m onetary am ount o r perhaps even the act of m aking payments helps manage the O bliga­ tion and reduces it more. EX AM PLE: SETTLEM ENT T H R O U G H CHARACTER ACTIONS John’s character has the Betrayal Obligation. The character used to be an Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) agent, but abandoned his position after witnessing Imperial actions and enslave­ meant of non-Humans. His betrayal hurt his in­ fluential family’s business and while the char­ acter is glad to be out of Imperial service, he highly regrets the residual effects. His betrayal is two-fold: Imperial and family. Given that he isn’t likely to ever aide the Imperials again, they are the most likely source of problems for him. To reduce his Obligation, he might focus on fix ­ ing his family connections by working to restore their business, using non-imperial clients. The GM must determine how much Obligation can be settled in a given fashion. Like the assignment of Obligation, it will vary due to circumstance. However, the GM should explain the reasoning behind each Ob­ ligation settlement, so that the players understand the process. If the amount of Obligation reduction varies without explanation, the players may become frustrat­ ed with the inconsistency. As with other rulings, the GM may listen to player reasons for a different amount of Obligation, but the GM has the final word. Obligation must be settled by a character’s ac­ tions. When th eir Obligation is activated, they should respond to it during the game session. Try­ ing to address the O bligation is not a guarantee of reducing it. Ignoring one’s Obligation often in­ creases the severity of response the next tim e the Obligation is activated. If a character ignores his Obligation after three activations, the character’s Obligation increases by five. E X AM PLE: CONSEQUENCES O F IG N O R IN G O B LIG A T IO N Sarah’s character has the Favor O bligation, owing a H utt for rescue from an Im perial de­ tension facility. The character’s O bligation is activated in a game session. The GM decides the H utt has called in p art of the favor, and requests she sell out a rival w ho’s also Sar­ ah’s character’s friend. Sarah refuses, and her character suffers the mechanical O bligation effects during the session. The next tim e the O bligation triggers, the H utt m ight demand she come and explain herself. If ignored, the H utt m ight send a message through a bounty hunter. If ignored a th ird time, the character’s O bligation is increased by five, and the Hutt m ight tip o ff the character’s location to the Empire, trying to get her recaptured. M A N A G I N G M I N I M A L O B L I G A T I O N In concept, Obligation never com pletely goes away, no m atter how much a character wants it to do so. This is represented by the minimum 5 Obligation per Player Character lim it. Some types of Obligation naturally fit this situation, Family, Obsession, and Responsibility, for example. They might be reduced to the point they d o n 't affect the character very often, but th e y’re still around. Other types may come to a natural conclusion. A character can com pletely pay o ff some debts, beat an addiction, or elim innate a blackmailer. Preferably, a character should always have some type of Obligation. However, if a character eliminates an Obli­ gation and does not take on more, he should be allowed to make that decision. His low level of Obligation makes it less likely it will be activated during the game. When it is, the CM will not have a specific type to rely on. In this case, the Obligation should come from the con­ sequences or results of an earlier adventure. Perhaps a crime lord the character or the party once crossed re­ surfaces and tries to pay them back. Maybe an Imperial agent they thought they escaped from or killed reappears in a new post. Since there is no way to eliminate this low level of Obligation, the only thing the characters can do is deal with the immediate circumstance as best they can. PLAYER MOTIVATIONS AND HOW TO USE THEM m otivations are built-in story and roleplaying hooks for both the player and the GM. The player uses Motivations to inform his character’s reactions to spe­ cific situations, offering a level of thought or detail be­ yond simply responding to the situation as presented. The GM uses Motivations to link the characters more intimately with the ongoing storyline. Players adhering to their characters' Motivations should be rewarded with additional XP, as well as more interesting plot lines. MANAGING MOTIVATIONS The GM should track player Motivations and how they may interact with a prepared adventure. Motivations, especially those determined randomly, may conflict with the assumed Player Character goals of a published adventure or GM created stories. After initial character creation, the GM should be able to better predict how their Motivations may interact with the intended plot. Players may keep their Motivations secret, possi­ bly going as far as establishing a decoy Motivation to cover their real one. Secret Motivations add to the depth and tension of the game, but also harbor pos­ sible story and party disruption when the secret is re­ vealed. If the party has widely divergent Motivations, the GM should be prepared to step in should player feelings be hurt if opposing Motivations are revealed. The GM may simplify the impact of Motivations on the story by encouraging characters with similar or compatible Motivations to combine them. Some Mo­ tivations also work well with certain types of Obliga­ tion. If the characters have divergent Motivations and types of Obligation, the GM may minimize the story complexity by de-emphasizing Motivation for those players who seem less interested in using the me­ chanic, or by incorporating it into fewer adventures. Characters should not often change their Motiva­ tions (see Changing M otiva tion s on page 97). When they do so, it should be for compelling story reasons, not because the bonus XP is too difficult to gain. Some Motivations may naturally end because the characters conclude a story integral to the Mo­ tivation. Some Motivations change slowly, as a new Motivation begins to dominate the character’s life or thinking. Changes to Motivations should also be re­ flected in the adventure or campaign. INCORPORATING MOTIVATIONS INTO THE STORY The GM should allow the player to dictate how impor­ tant his character’s Motivation is to his experience. Whereas Obligation is intended to be an outside force that permeates character interaction and the ability to function within the adventure, Motivation focuses on the character’s internal drive and how that influ­ ences his interaction with the galaxy. If the player wants to focus on his personal story, or consistently gain the XP awards from adhering to his Motivation, the GM is encouraged to incorporate his Motivation into the adventure more often. Not all Motivations need to provide deep story hooks. If a player is more comfortable reacting to situ­ ations as they unfold than dealing with a super-secret background history with surprise appearances by past enemies or events, then the GM should allow them to play to that style. Some players are happy to simply use their Motivation to justify their current actions. The potential interaction of character Motivations and Obligations can inspire the CM to weave a com­ plex storyline, complete with surprises from the past or unknown connections between characters. This ap­ proach works best if the details trickle out during the adventure, foreshadowing larger revelations. However, an unexpected connection or reveal can add more tension or surprise to an already climactic scene. Motivation XP bonuses should not be automatically achievable in every game session. If possible, the CM should use rewards or story issues to make sticking to a Motivation a real choice. The character gains the bonus XP, but loses out on some other reward and causes difficulty with the plot or other characters. Sticking to a Motivation should be an interesting, and sometimes difficult, choice. Otherwise the bonus XP is too easily achievable. REWARDING MOTIVATIONS Mechanically, the reward for adhering to a Motivation is simple: 5 XP per session, with a one-time 10 XP reward for an exceptional session, occurring once in the character’s life. Additional awards are not usually necessary, as they become the regular awards nor­ mally integrated into the campaign. Story-wise, players should be rewarded for adhering to their Motivations by including opportunities to inter­ act with them more often. An exceptionally good use of Motivation might be rewarded with a tangible, in­ game item or advantageous situation. This is especially helpful if the results of adhering to Motivation were ac­ tually not in the party’s or player’s best interest. On the flip side, players should not be overly penal­ ized for violating their Motivations. People and charac­ ters are complex entities and it is sometimes difficult to anticipate when a character might find other forces more compelling than their normal internal drive. Usu­ ally, the characters simply do not receive the XP re­ wards or story advantages and play continues. CREATING NEW MOTIVATIONS The potential for character Motivations extends beyond the three primary Motivations and their specific exam­ ples included in Edge of the Empire. Future products will detail additional Motivations. CMs or players may cre­ ate their own Motivations using the following guidelines: • Check to see if the proposed Motivation fits with­ in the Ambition, Cause, and Relationship catego­ ries. If not, it is a new Motivation. • Check to see if the proposed specific Motivation fits with any of the existing specific Motivations. If so, consider using the listed Motivation instead. • Create a new category, if needed. Try creating a short list of specific Motivations to test if the cat­ egory is broad enough. • Establish the expected types of stories likely to come from the new Motivation, so the GM and player fully understand the intended driving force behind it. • Make sure the new Motivation is something the character will have to work to maintain. Avoid Motivations that easily give up their XP rewards every session through actions a character might take in any game session, regardless of story. • Offer the new Motivation to the other players, un­ less it is intended to remain secret in the game. THE BASE OF OPERATIONS T he base of operations is an important concept in an Edge of the Em pire campaign. The base of op­ erations serves as the focal point for a group, helping to bind them together into a cohesive single entity as opposed to disparate individuals. This book assumes the base of operations is a group’s starship, and is written accordingly. However, a base of operations could be any number of things, from a single cantina the group owns to an entire space station. The con­ cept is more important than the physical form the base of operations takes. As long as the group sees it as their home and a place from which to operate, it's serving its proper purpose. The concept of a "home base” is a constant theme in Star Wars. The most well known, of course, is Han and Chewbacca’s Millennium Falcon, the aging and iconic tramp freighter the two rogues piloted around the galaxy. For them, and other characters in the movies, the Falcon quickly became more than a means of transportation; it became their home. Hopefully the players in Edge of the Empire can es­ tablish the same relationship with their own base of operations; whether it’s a starship, station, or any other location. The GM can help engender this rela­ tionship through his own actions as well. USING A BASE OF OPERATIONS Groups of player characters often start the game only loosely or tangentially affiliated. Many players build their characters with a particular background and character story in mind. This is perfectly acceptable but it does mean that when the group convenes for the first time, the GM has a collection of individual characters that may not have a common thread or backstory to bind them together. Over time and the course of working together on sev­ eral adventures, the group will become a more cohesive whole. This happens through the process of working together to face shared challenges and develop shared goals. The base of operations serves a two-fold purpose in this process. First, it provides an initial catalyst for working together (most starships require several crew members to operate, after all), and gives every player character in the group something they can share in and jointly own. Secondly, it can evolve over time into some of the goals the player characters share. Improving their base of operations, protecting it, or even purchasing and establishing a new one are all goals shared by an entire group, not just one or two characters. During gameplay, a base of operations also serves a valuable purpose as a place groups can return to be­ tween encounters and adventures. This is where they can safely rest, rearm, and recover from injury. If need be, this is where they can flee to when in danger. This means a base of operations is primarily a nar­ rative concept, rather than a mechanical one. There may be rules governing the base of operation's physi­ cal form (for example, a starship serving as a base of operations has a starship profile), but its primary uses are narrative. RESOURCES The group's base of operations often serves as a place to stockpile group resources. While many items and pieces of gear may be owned by a specific char­ acter (such as personal weapons and armor sets), it makes more sense for other items to be jointly owned by a group. For example, it makes more sense for the group to jointly own one bacta tank (instead of multiple individual tanks), one astromech droid for navigation, a single repair kit for starship maintenance, or even one tent and crash survival kit. The base of operations pro­ vides a place to store these items where any members of the group can access them as needed. The most common starship a group uses is the light or medium freighter; an affordable vessel with options for customization and enough space for the entire crew. However, it is perfectly possible, and logical, for mercenaries to use a small-to-medium warship, or for a scouting party to use a specialized scout ship. Individual starfighters are not recommended as a base of operations, due to their single or dual seat configurations. A GM might allow a squadron in a mercenary style campaign but the group is still go­ ing to need a place to store these vessels. Very likely that would be a larger ship that could serve as a base of operations. Speeders are also not generally appro­ priate, but large speeders may be usable in the right adventure. A large sail barge, for example, could cer­ tainly work as a base of operations. Large-scale capital ships such as a Star Destroyer or Mon Calamari Cruiser may be used as a base of operations. However, the sheer size and power of such vessels (not to mention the cost of keeping one run­ ning), should prohibit most groups from obtaining or using them. In general, the guidelines found on page A base of operations can also serve as a stockpile of "odds and ends” that the player characters may need in the future, even without the group keeping track of these specific items. The rules for spending Destiny Points to gain access to minor but valuable pieces of equipment such as respirators (see page 28) also rely on the existence of a base of operations. Narra­ tively, its easier to explain finding the rebreather set tucked away in the corner of a starship’s cargo hold than just having them appear out of thin air. RESTAND RECUPERATION The galaxy is a dangerous place and a base of opera­ tions serves a vital role as a place a group can return to and recover from its perils. Often, healing wounds or recovering from critical injuries takes time and the base of operations provides a haven where the injured can spend that time safe from danger. In addition, a base of operations can house complete medical facilities (as opposed to emergency medkits and stimpacks) allow­ ing for quicker recovery from injuries. Even the uninjured can benefit from a place to rest and remove strain. TRAVEL AND INCOME GENERATION The Star Wars universe is big—an entire galaxy of exot­ ic locales. One of the reasons Edge of the Empire’s de­ fault base of operations is a starship is so that groups are guaranteed a means of transportation. Being able to travel to a new world can open up whole hosts of new possibilities for adventures. Likewise, having ac­ cess to a starship means the group can take on all sorts of interesting (and potentially dangerous) paying jobs such as smuggling, exploring new star systems, and tracking bounties from world to world. These provide a steady stream of income for the group, and often become adventures in their own right. GROUP IDENTITY As the group of Player Characters grows and evolves, it often assumes its own group identity. This can co­ alesce around the group’s base of operations. For ex­ ample, if their base of operations is a starship, they become the crew of that starship, and that’s how NPCs begin to identify them (and hopefully, how they identify themselves). The same holds true if the base of operations is a cantina or even a space station. SELECTING A STARSHIP As merchants, smugglers, mercenaries, scouts, or ga­ lactic vagabonds, the party’s natural base of opera­ tions is a hyperspace-capable starship. Normally, the party must be in control of their vessel and have some claim to it. Preferably, they are the owners of the star- ship, even if they are deeply in debt regarding pay­ ments or are embroiled in other circumstances. HITTING THEM WHERE THEY LIVE F or GMs, a base of operations also offers the opportunity for a classic adventure twist: hit­ ting the PCs at home. This is a tried-and-true plot twist in movies and literature—mostly because it works. Threatening the PCs’ home or attacking them at home can make a threat seem much more real and dangerous. After all, if a villain attacks them in their “safe haven,” where are they going to run? Of course, it’s important to use this carefully, and not overuse it. First, the GM has to give the group a chance to establish the base of op­ erations as a home. Usually this means waiting three or more sessions, preferably while the group is making use of their base of opera­ tions. Until the group takes their base of op­ erations for granted as a place of refuge, there is little point in imperiling it. Second, the CM should not make a habit of attacking a group’s base too often (perhaps as little as once ever). All too quickly, groups be­ come jaded to this threat or stop relying on their base of operations at all. Finally, the CM should always leave a way for the group to either rebuild their base of opera­ tions elsewhere or restore its safety (possibly by eliminating the threat themselves). A game that puts a group’s backs against the wall but then allows them to triumph against the odds can be very enjoyable for everyone involved. 99 for a starting group starship should determine what starship the group has and, by extension, the starship best suited to work as a base of operations. CONTACTS As the group participates in more adventures and travels through the galaxy, they’ll likely make contacts. Contacts are NPCs who can provide information or resources to the group, and while some may be specific to a certain player character, others are general contacts who know the entire group. These contacts can be tracked as part of the group’s base of operations. These contacts might be established narratively (especially if they owe the players) or may be purchased through group resources or by undertaking group Obligation. Contacts requiring greater initial Obligation should be more powerful, have access to more resources, and/or be better connected. A low Obligation contact might be a lesser criminal boss, where a high Obliga­ tion contact could be Jabba the Hutt. The CM may require that the party complete an adventure with the contact. They might work with the contact or he may bail them out in exchange for Obligation. Contacts may incur additional Obligation as the ad­ venture or campaign proceeds. The source of any ad­ ditional owed Obligation should be noted with the contacts and recorded with all other Obligation entries. However, if the characters manage to fulfill their Obliga­ tion to the contract, they can still retain the contact (as long as the CM decides it makes sense for the ongoing narrative of the campaign). At that point, they may not owe the contact anything but their history in working to­ gether ensures the contact is still willing to help them. It’s also very likely that some of the group’s contacts may owe the group something, whether favors, money, or some other debt. In this case, the group should just note the contact in their list and list them in their Ob­ ligations. It’s also possible that the status of the con­ tact and Obligations owed changes over the course of the campaign. The important thing for a CM to keep in mind is that the status of a contact and any Obligation owed to the contact can be two independent points. Contacts can provide material aid to groups but their most valuable role in an adventure is providing information. CMs can use contacts to advance the plot of an adventure by providing valuable informa­ tion to their player characters through an “in-game" source. Likewise, if players know their characters have contacts, they will likely feel it’s well within the realm of an adventure to ask their contacts for information. ALTERNATE BASES OF OPERATIONS While Edge of the Empire focuses on ships as the par­ ty ’s base of operations, other types are possible, such as hidden bases, cantinas, hideouts, strongholds, academies, and more. The guidelines covering bases of operations mentioned previously apply equally to any type of base of operations. ADJUDICATING DESTINY POINTS D estiny Points represent the inherent connection be­ tween the characters, the villains, and the fate of the galaxy—or at least their part in it. Destiny Points are flexible and fickle, sometimes aiding the characters, sometimes hindering them. They also represent the influence of the light and dark sides of the Force on the character's actions and lives. The characters typi­ cally use light side points to increase their chances to achieve their goals, while the CM typically uses dark side points to hinder and obstruct them. The flow of points between the light and dark side pools are repre­ sentative of the shifting balance of power between the light and dark side of the Force. Generally speaking, the Player Characters are the good guys of the game and thus may only spend light side Destiny Points, and the CM may only spend dark side Destiny Points. See page 27 for a complete explanation of Destiny Point mechanics. ENCOURAGING DESTINY POINT USE The flow of Destiny Points may vary greatly between dif­ ferent parties and CMs. Newcomers to the game may be reluctant to spend Destiny Points for fear of having them unavailable when a more important or critical situ­ ation arises. The CM should encourage Destiny Point use throughout the game. He should spend points regu­ larly to replenish the light side pool, and to highlight the integral role of destiny in the Star Wars setting. The players may decide to ration Destiny Point use, and it is within their rights to form a strategy for Destiny Point expenditure. Beyond keeping points for their own use, they might also hoard them to prevent the CM from using them at critical moments. This is a good occasional tactic, but if it becomes a regular problem, the CM should balance things out by hold­ ing back a few points for his use. Ideally, there should be a free flow of Destiny Points throughout the game. While not every die roll needs to be influenced, the CM should use them often when major NPCs are involved, or critical moments arise. Overuse in lesser situations may annoy or demoralize the players, especially if things don’t go their way. More subtly, the sudden and consistent use of Destiny Points against consecutive die rolls can high­ light the difficulty of the Player Characters’ current approach. Perhaps the dark side is stronger at this location. Perhaps the Player Characters have taken the wrong path and this is the way the Force is telling them there might be a better approach. By using Des­ tiny Points instead of ■ to fulfill this role, it hints at the influence of the Force over the situation, instead of a naturally occurring environmental, physical, or political hindrance. DESTINY POINTS AS NARRATIVE AID One of the more powerful uses of Destiny Points is to creatively influence the ongoing story. The players may spend Destiny Points to improve their immediate situ­ ation. These expenditures can be classified into three categories: dumb luck, reasonable extrapolation, and common sense. DUMB LUCK Dumb luck comes into play when the play­ ers request something that might reason­ ably be expected to be absent in the cur­ rent location or situation, but is somehow available. Examples include finding a datapad in the seat cushions of a com­ mandeered transport, finding a pass­ word noted on a piece of paper and hidden in a desk, discovering a rare piece of equipment in an .abandoned mechanics shop, or even just recovering the right part in a junk pile. Dumb luck can explain a great many things, but should not be allowed to work when it stretches credulity too much. Salvaging exactly the right hyperdrive part from a dissimilar starship shouldn’t normally work. REASONABLE EXTRAPOLATION Reasonable extrapolation occurs when the players re­ quest something that could logically be available in the current location. Finding a medpac in an emergency ve­ hicle, locating a secured comlink for an enemy’s comm system on a high ranking officer, and benefiting from an NPCs logical planning ahead are examples of reasonable extrapolation. Most of the time, the characters should find what they are looking for. It may not be exactly what they want, but should be adaptable in some fashion. COMMON SENSE Sometimes, an item should be available because of common sense. For example, fruit should be avail­ able from a fruit tree in season, a toolbox contains the proper common tool, or a freighter’s computer system contains the shipping manifest. The item is expected to be there but there is not a 100% chance, which makes the Destiny Point useful. If the requested item is nearly guaranteed to be there, the GM may even grant the item without the Destiny Point. It is up to the GM to approve all Destiny Point uses to influence the narrative. In essence, the GM should decide if the request is reasonable given the circum­ stances and assess any impact to the adventure plot. Creativity should be rewarded whenever pos­ sible. Plowever, the players should not be allowed to abuse the system to avoid paying for something they could otherwise afford or circumvent prohibi­ tions that would normally prevent them from ac­ quiring the item or service. Likewise, the charac­ ters should not be allowed to use a Destiny Point to make up for forgotten items or poor planning, or to give them something they purposefully avoided or left behind. If the Destiny Point use would derail the ad­ venture plot, it should be denied or altered, even if it was normally a reasonable request in other circumstances. For example, if part of the adventure requires the characters to deal with limited resources, using a Destiny Point to find a needed item at just the right mo­ meant probably should not be allowed. RUNNING A FULL CAMPAIGN C ampaigns are to adventures what the Star Wars saga is to individual movies. A campaign is a long term story arc in which the action that occurs within the story of each adventure adds to the arc. Campaigns give the players time to play, develop, and advance their charac­ ters. Running a highly detailed campaign is not neces­ sary; a GM might opt to run largely unconnected adven­ tures with the Player Characters as the only constant. However, developing a larger story arc gives the players the chance to attain a greater goal that is not logically attainable in a single adventure. WHAT IS AN EDGE OF THE EMPIRE CAMPAIGN? As with Edge of the Empire adventures, the campaigns highlighted in this book emphasize the rougher and darker aspects of the galaxy. The Player Characters are more likely to spend their time at the fringes of space and society than the height of Core World splendor. They likely know more about the criminal underworld than the protocols of high government. That’s not to say that the Core Worlds or government intrigue can’t be part of the story, but if they are, it is more likely to be in the darker, more corrupt, and more sinister edges of seemingly high society. The characters’ personal connections are typically shady at best, and often downright crooked, manipu­ lative, and dangerous. Even when the characters try to follow a lawful or honorable path, their situations and associates keep corrupting their choices. This is not to say the characters can never escape a bad situation, but it doesn’t take very long for new problems to crop up. Edce of the Empire campaigns typically focus on the fringes of society. Run-ins with Imperials are common in most regions of the galaxy, while Rebel Alliance-focused stories are not common. The Player Characters may encounter Rebel sympathizers or agents from time to time, and even work for them, but the struggle between the Rebellion and the Empire is not the focus of these campaigns. Unless the campaign is truly in an isolated backwater, the fringes of the galaxy, or a self-centered region like the Corporate Sector, the Player Characters should at least hear about Rebel activities from time to time, and might experience them directly or indirectly. OUTLINING THE CAMPAIGN Campaigns are made of multiple adventures, usually three or more, that require multiple game sessions to complete. Some campaigns may last weeks, months, or even years in real time. When creating a new cam­ paign, the CM should outline the major events, loca­ tions, and characters of the story arc. It isn’t necessary to understand every connection to every story idea from the beginning. A loose, logical progression of ma­ jor events will form a skeletal plot that can be detailed as play proceeds, especially when creating individual adventures. Much like adventures, campaigns usually have a beginning, middle, and end, though it may use multiple adventures within each act. LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR CAMPAIGNS Like adventures, campaigns may use a linear or non­ linear progression of stories. Linear progressions allow one story to build directly on the events of the previous adventure. However, they tend to restrict Player Charac­ ter freedom to take the story in unexpected directions. The GM must spend time and resources to keep the Player Characters on track and the players might feel railroaded if it disrupts their illusion of choice too much. A non-linear campaign takes more planning, but allows for a lot more flexibility in play. In a non-linear campaign, the results of an adventure dictate which adventure comes next. When outlining the campaign, the GM cre­ ates a flowchart or tree of adventures, where a positive or negative (or other) outcome links up with an adven­ true that is based on that result. Some adventures may be skipped by the Player Characters, depending on the exact layout of the chart. GMs that like to give the players a lot of leeway in the direction of the campaign may find that the non-linear approach allows the story arc to pro­ ceed easily, even if the circumstances or specifics change. Example Campaign Concept: Hyperspace rail­ road. The Player Characters are dedicated to freeing slaves from the Empire, the Hutts, and various locales. Perhaps some of the Player Characters are escaped or rescued slaves themselves. The Player Characters may be altruistic, but likely seek some kind of fee for their services. They might be smugglers, trained mer­ cenaries, or a combination. Sample Linear Campaign Basic Outline: • Episode 1: The Slave Ship. The Player Charac­ ters respond to a distress call from a Trandoshan freighter, damaged by an asteroid strike. The Trandoshans ask the Player Characters to board their vessels to help with repairs. Once aboard, the Trandoshans try to capture any non-Human Player Characters. The Player Characters manage to free the slaves and a fight erupts to capture the ship. The Player Characters also learn the Tran­ doshans work for a particular Hutt, as part of his slave trading network. Episode 2: Wookiees are Trouble. One of the rescued slaves is a Wookiee who convinces the Player Characters he is wealthy. He hires them to rescue his family from Kashyyyk. Afterwards, the Player Characters go to Kwenn Space Station to reunite the family. They find the Wookiee is gone, taken by bounty hunters to Nar Shaddaa. The Player Characters follow and clash with the Hutt crime lord to free the Wookiee. They eventually escape, taking the Wookiee back to Kwenn Space Station. Episode 3: On the Run. The Hutt (or his asso­ ciates if he didn’t survive) puts a bounty on the Player Characters’ heads. They are attacked at Kwenn or another location. If they defeat their at­ tackers, they escape. If not, they are taken and held for transport to the Hutt. The Player Charac­ ters find their pursuers are persistent, and must deal with unexpected attacks for a time. Episode 4: Hutt Showdown. The Player Char­ acters discover ways they might get their bound­ ties removed, such as paying off, eliminating, or blackmailing the Hutt. They obtain the cash or information for blackmail, or plan to shut down his slave operation. They seek him out and set up a showdown on their own terms. They discover he also has a Hutt bounty on him. If they capture him and turn him over to the right Hutt, they cash in and disable the network. Sample Campaign Flowchart / Tree Outline: See below for the campaign tree. This tree builds off of the linear campaign above, and adds the following possible adventures: • Episode 1A: Trandoshan Guests. If the Trandoshans capture the Player Characters in Episode l , the Player Characters are held and taken to a remote world. The Trandoshans land and use their ship to host an auction. The Play­ er Characters get another opportunity to stage an escape during the auction. If they succeed, they may try to take the Trandoshan ship, or one of the buyer’s vessels. • Episode 2A: The Depths of Nar Shaddaa. If the Player Characters fail to free the Wookiee, they learn he has been moved to a prison in the lowest levels of Nar Shaddaa. The Player Characters must brave criminals, creatures, and worse to break him out. • Episode 4A: Hutt Revenge. If they fail to capture or kill the Hutt, the Player Characters find the bound­ ties have doubled. They are constantly harassed by bounty hunters. Criminals won’t deal with them and even friends fear being seen with them. They must confront the Hutt again or flee the area. BEWARE OF BORING BATTLES B attle scenes and skirmishes may happen in most any locale. However, some locations are naturally more available during the course of the campaign. Setting too many encounters in these locations quickly becomes monotonous and restrictive. They should not be ignored or abandoned, but limited and controlled by the CM, spontaneous battles not­ withstanding. Likewise, if Player Character tactics be­ come too predictable from skirmish to skirmish, the GM should introduce surprise elements to break the Player Characters out of their routine. Corridor, doorway, and airlock fights should be minimized or eliminated whenever possible. These battles typically discourage movement, as characters take cover or clog the doorway. A better solution is to get the characters into the larger (and hopefully more interesting) room or space beyond the door before the battle begins. End boring chases quickly. Chases should be fast, exciting, dangerous, and finish quickly. If it becomes apparent one side will never catch the other, the CM should find a way to end it and move on to the next scene. Unexpected obstacles, a sudden burst of speed, or a mysterious disappearance behind a mo­ mentary impediment can halt a chase immediately. Player Characters who consistently use the same Initiative order or choices may be making good tactical moves, but might also be irritating those who never go first. The CM can mitigate this issue by initiating battles with those who normally act later, while the rest are otherwise occupied. DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL ADVENTURES When creating the campaign, it is not necessary to fully flesh out all adventures at the beginning. The GM may develop each adventure in order. By waiting until the adventure is needed, the GM may adapt the specifics to the exact situation as it has developed in the game. At this point, the adventure concept should be outlined and developed. New locations should be mapped out and the appropriate NPCs created or noted. Below is a sample adventure concept, using one of the examples from the campaign notes above. Example Adventure Concept: The Player Characters are hired to smuggle a Wookiee family off of Kashyyyk and bring them to Kwenn Space Station in Hutt Space. Sample Adventure Story Arc Progression: 1. The Player Characters sneak past Imperial pa­ trols, land on Kashyyyk, con/bluff/break the Wookiees out of their slave pens, and avoid Impe­ rial interceptors to escape the system. 2. The Player Characters arrive at Kwenn Space Station to discover that their Wookiee employer has been captured by bounty hunters. It takes time to track down the hunters. They discover the Wookiee has been handed over to a Hutt crime lord. He has already taken the Wookiee to Nar Shaddaa, the smuggler's moon deep in Hutt territory. The Player Characters must free the Wookiee if they want to get paid. 3. The Player Characters arrive at Nar Shaddaa. The crime lord has multiple lairs. The Player Characters must discern which one holds the Wookiee. They must devise a way into the Hutt’s hideout and negotiate for the Wookiee’s freedom, or plan a way to break him out. If successful, the Player Characters must retreat through Nar Shaddaa, with the Hutts pursuing them. Once the Wookiees are reunited, they hire the Player Characters to take them to another world. CREATING AND USING MAJOR VILLAINS Campaigns usually include at least one major villain op­ posing the Player Characters. While the villain could be something generic, like the Empire, it is much more ef­ fective to make him or her an individual person or small group roughly equal in power. This puts a face on the faction he or she is part of. This is especially helpful when the faction is unlikely to be defeated by the Player Characters. The villain can be defeated, even if the over­ all organization cannot. The villain may be known from the beginning or may be revealed as the plot develops. Major villains must be memorable (see Assembling the Cast, on page 302). They are most effective if their handiwork is seen in operation, even when they are not around. Villains must do evil, villainous things to motivate the Player Characters and set up a rivalry for good roleplaying. That’s not to say every villain must be evil incarnate, but major villains should be worse than the average bad guy. Villains in an Edge of the Empire campaign usually come from the darker side of the galaxy. Pirates, con artists, raiders, hardened criminals, slavers, crime lords, brutal mercenaries, out of control bounty hunt­ ers, and others make good villains. Imperial ship cap­ tains and high level Imperial Security Bureau agents can ruin any Player Character’s day. SELECTING LOCATIONS The Star Wars galaxy is filled with fantastic locations and exotic environments. GMs should select spectacu­ lar locations when creating their adventures and cam­ paigns. For example, Cloud City floating above a gas giant planet, the city-sinkholes of Utapau, and the city- planets of Coruscant (Imperial Center) and Nar Shaddaa all offer very different and unique urban environments. While some adventure types may be run at any of these locations, others will be enhanced by selecting one that complements the NPCs and envisioned plot Edge of the Empire locations tend to be seedy, rough, and distant. If the location itself isn't somewhat intimidating, the char­ acters inhabiting it or the situation itself should be. Selecting individual encounter locations is also im­ portant. They should be interesting in some fashion- location, layout, environmental effects or hazards, or even the characters or creatures they encounter. Avoid setting final battles or encounters in mundane locales or hallways. These should the epic locations that should add greatly to the atmosphere and actual gameplay. ADVENTURES & ENCOUNTERS INSPIRED BY OBLIGATION AND MOTIVATION The flexible nature of the campaign format allows GMs to insert adventures or encounters prompted by sudden character actions, which are motivated by their Obligation or Motivation. When planning the campaign, the GM should outline several encounters and a couple of adventures appropriate to the Player Character’s Obligation and Motivation incentives. Pre­ pared encounters make these spontaneous actions easier for the GM to deal with on the fly. E X AM PLE O B LIG A T IO N ENCOUNTERS: Addiction: A dealer, pusher, or fellow addict un­ expectedly arrives and tries to sell his goods or tem pt the Player Character into giving in to his addiction. He interrupts the Player Characters in a public space and make a scene. The law isn’t far behind. Betrayal or Blackmail: The Player Character suddenly realizes that the person the party has to deal with knows something about his betray­ al or blackmail. The Player Character may have to avoid the situation or confront the individual. Either might tip off his teammates, potentially damaging their relationship. Family, Favor, or Responsibility: A message or individual arrives, demanding the Player Char­ acter’s immediate help. Doing so disrupts the Player Character’s or party’s plans. Refusal or delay makes the situation much worse, and the demands keep coming. E X AM PLE M O TIV A TIO N ENCOUNTERS: Am bition (Fame): The Player Character is of­ fered the opportunity to fly in a famous, but illegal, swoop race. Winning the race grants a big reputation boost across the Outer Rim, but merely participating draws unwanted Imperial or bounty hunter attention to the party. Cause (Non-Human rights): The Player Charac­ ter sees a group of ISB agents arresting only non-Human refugees disembarking from a pas­ senger ship. The opportunity presents itself to stop the agents and free the refugees, but will completely disrupt the party’s plans. Relationship (Clan): A Rodian Player Character’s clan is engaged in a not-so-secret war with an­ other clan. The Player Character sees the op­ portunity to ambush a member of the clan while working with the party on a different mission. Doing so will draw unwanted attention to the operation but will raise the Player Character’s status among his clan. If the CM prefers a style of campaign that relies much more on player decisions than CM plotting, he should regularly mine the Player Character’s Obligation and M otivation for encounter ideas. Entire adventures and campaigns may be con­ structured around these two mechanics and the situ­ ations they produce. The base of operations also provides regular inspiration for adventure ideas, as the Player Characters try to improve their ves­ sel and th eir situation. PLANNING REWARDS Every adventure in the campaign should have built-in rewards. Rewards may be money, equipment, vehicles, influence, or something less tangible but equally value­ able to the Player Characters. Having a debt forgiven, receiving a favor, or being introduced to an influential figure are examples of intangible but valuable rewards. Story rewards are also a must for adventures. Not every encounter needs this, but the completion of an adventure should alter the amount of Obligation the characters and party carries forward. Rewarding players for adhering to their Motivations also keeps the party happy. Rewards at the end of the campaign should tie di­ rectly to the overall plot and be impressive enough to satisfy or impress the players. If the Player Char­ acters continue in a follow-up campaign, be careful when doling out the rewards and be ready for them to come into play in the next campaign. DEALING WITH PARTY CHANGES Long-running campaigns increase the likelihood that one or more players leave before the campaign is fin­ ished. Fortunately, the extended storylines provide multiple situations for a character to leave and a new character to be introduced. CMs should look for natu­ ral opportunities to do so, such as between adven­ tures or when the players are in a starport or other public location where they might meet a new addition to the crew or party. Usually, a player leaves due to scheduling conflicts, as other life events influence playing time. However, if one or more players leave because they are not enjoy­ ing the campaign, the GM should get feedback from them and the remaining players and consider altering the game. If the remaining players are okay with the direction and there is little the GM can do to keep the departing players, there may not be much to change. However, if the players are not enjoying the campaign and the GM can do something about it, he definitely should alter it. This applies to published adventures as well as original work. KEEPING THE CAMPAIGN ON TRACK Keeping the campaign moving forward can be chal­ lenging when the players take the story in an unex­ pected direction. Remember, most campaign outlines can withstand a lot of flexing and adjustment. Feel free to insert additional adventures, perhaps special adventures to deal with an unexpected twist, into the outline at any time. If the players want their charac­ ters to follow a path that is completely inappropriate for the campaign or create subplots along the way, it is usually time to run an individual adventure or series of encounters to play out the situation. CONCLUDING THE CAMPAIGN The conclusion of a campaign should be the highlight of the entire story arc. Being Star Wars, it should in­ clude an impressive skirmish or battle, along with a dose of personal drama for one or more characters. All major plots and subplots should be resolved logi­ cally and satisfactorily to the players. Many campaigns end early due to unforeseen cir­ cumstances or player or GM fatigue. If interest is wan­ ing, the GM should end the game in a satisfying way, rather letting it fall apart. Concluding a long-running campaign is often a major feat that the players and GM should rightly celebrate beyond the game. ALTERNATE AND OPTIONAL RULES I n Edge of the Empire, there are some rules that are not integral to gameplay. Though the players and CM should not need to use these rules (and for this rea­ son, they are not presented with the rest of the game), these rules might help in some specific situations. All of these rules are not part of the Edge of the Empire rules set. They are alternate rules, and should not be used unless two conditions are met: • The CM must decide to use the rules. • The CM must discuss them with the group, and the group must agree to use the rules as well. Croups can use any number of these rules; as one does not require the others be used, groups can mix and match as they choose. MAKING PASSIVE CHECKS Not all checks are of vital importance to the story. Sometimes, a CM just needs to know if the character knows some useful information, or has the necessary skills to overcome a simple problem. In this case, the CM can call for a passive check Once the CM determines the difficulty of the check, the PC can spend a maneuver to make the check. The PC simply compares the ranks he has in the relevant skill to the difficulty of the check. If his ranks exceed the number of ^ added to the pool, he passes the check, with a number of successes equal to the difference be­ tween the two. If his ranks do not exceed the number of p a d d e d to the pool, he fails. He can, however, try to make the check as an action later. The passive check exists to reduce the need for assem­ bling and rolling dice pools. Making a check in Edce of the Empire is a relatively important event. Any check can generate <§> and O , and many can generate ($) and These need to be resolved, and may result in effects of great import and excitement for players during a game. However, there may be some situations in the game where the events going on are relatively mundane, and the GM wants to maintain that. (This might occur during narrative downtime, for example). Passive checks remove the check from the occasion, meaning that player char­ acters won’t gain O or (&, but also won’t have to con­ tend with <§> or ^ Essentially, they exist to determine the success of mundane tasks that a player character should already know how to perform (since they must have one or more ranks in a skill to succeed on a passive check). However, the GM should keep some aspects of this op­ tional rule in mind when implementing it. This rule can penalize players whose characters have lower skills and higher characteristics, as opposed to players who chose to invest in higher skills and lower characteristics for their characters. Also, if they do employ the rule, they should remember that even if a PC fails a passive check, he can always try again using a regular check. ALTERNATE RULES FOR INITIATIVE The following are two alternative rules for determining ini­ tiative in encounters. Its intention is to speed up the time it takes to begin an encounter by reducing bookkeeping at the beginning of an encounter. These rules are presented for groups who prefer to transfer quickly from narrative to encounter gameplay, without any ‘lag’’ as the GM sets up the encounter and determines the initiative order. THE PASSIVE CHECK VARIANT The first rule uses a variant on the passive check con­ cept from the prior section to determine initiative. At the beginning of the encounter, each PC or NPC determines whether they would use Cool or Vigilance depending on the circumstances. Then, instead of making a check, each simply compares skill ranks. The highest rank determines the highest initiative slot, and so-forth. Ties always go to PCs. The benefit of this system is that it moves quickly and still rewards players who invest in the Cool or Vigi­ lance skills. However, there are some aspects of this rule players should be aware of. First, like with other passive checks, this system is less useful for charac­ ters who have a high Willpower or Presence and low Cool or Vigilance. Second, early in games when most players have 0-2 ranks in a skill, there are likely to be a lot of ties with NPCs, meaning PCs will usually go before NPCs. This can skew encounters, and should be something a GM considers when building them. THE CHECKING ONCE PER SESSION VARIANT The second rule requires PCs to check initiative, but does so at the beginning of a session, instead of dur­ ing the beginning of each encounter. During the setup for a session, the CM has each play­ er character make one Cool and one Vigilance initiative check. He records the results, then does the same thing for any potential adversaries the PCs might encoun­ ter during that session. During the session, instead of checking initiative at the beginning of an encounter, the CM uses the pre-generated results from the beginning of the session. He does this for any and all encounters the PCs get involved with during the session. This option has several benefits that may make it appealing to groups. Primarily it allows PCs to benefit from having high Presence or Willpower, instead of just Vigilance or Cool. It also gives the initiative order a wider "spread” of results, and does not guarantee that the character with the highest skill rating goes first, or the character with the lowest skill rating goes last. However, there are several limitations with this rule that should be considered. First and foremost, this system "locks" players into the results of one check at the beginning of the session. If they generate mediocre results, they have to deal with this for the entirety of the session, and this could generate frustration. Another issue to remember is that neither of these alternative initiative rules allow GMs to add environ­ mental bonuses to initiative checks, and some player character abilities (such as the □ bonus for the Height­ need Awareness talent, for example) might not be able to be used when determining the initiative order. ONE-CHECK COMBAT RESOLUTION The following rule is intended to help GMs resolve ongoing combat encounters more quickly. When the results of a combat encounter are a foregone conclu­ sion but playing through the remaining turns would take additional time that could be better spent con­ tinuing the story, the GM can employ this rule. At the beginning of the round the GM wants combat to end, he asks each PC to make one final check. The nature of this check depends on what each player wants their character to do to help resolve the re­ mainder of the encounter. Once each player makes their choice, they roll the check as normal. Success means they accomplish their part in the resolution of the encounter; additional # may mean they play an even greater role. O can be spent to recover strain, while means the member gains an unexpected reward from the encounter; may­ be a bag of frag grenades or pouch of credits from an E X AM PLE ENCOUNTER RES O LU TIO N : Hash, Oskara, 41-VEX, and Lowhhrick are fight­ ing a street gang. The fight has not been going well for the gangers; of the eight original mem­ bers, only three are left. The GM decides the results of the encounter are foregone and would like to move things along. Each character must select one skill check to determine how they bring the encounter to a close. Hash selects Pilot (Planetary) as his choice, saying he rams the group’s speeder into the pile of crates the gangers are hiding behind to drive them out of cover. Lowhhrick and Oskara both select Ranged (Heavy), choosing to mow down the suddenly ex­ posed gangers. Finally, 41-VEX selects Comput­ ers, slicing into local law enforcement databases and directing the authorities to a different loca­ tion while the band makes their escape. adversary, or a reputation as an extremely dangerous individual. Conversely, uncanceled T should result in the character suffering an equal number of wounds, while <§> inflicts strain and each ^ Inflicts a critical hit. These are the injuries acquired as the encounter ends. The encounter resolves successfully no matter how well the PCs do on their check; the checks simply de­ determine whether or not the PCs resolve the remainder of the encounter without incident, or if they pick up some cuts and bruises on the way. The primary benefit of this rule is that it can resolve encounters where the outcome is foregone. Forcing players to eliminate every adversary can sometimes be tedious, and this helps avoid that sense of frustration. On the other hand, the GM should be careful to only use this when the outcome is certain and never when there’s a chance of PC failure. Also, he should avoid using it during especially momentous combats, such as those against particularly noteworthy adversaries. THE GALAXY T he Star Wars galaxy is a vast and wondrous place, with myriad species, spectacular worlds, interstel­ lar hazards, and more. While the average galactic citizen may never stray too far from his home world, the adventurous, the daring, and the ambitious can find endless opportunities, legitimate or- otherwise. How a traveler feels about the galaxy at large, or in­ dividual planets or regions, largely depends on the lens through which he views it. An Imperial politician regards galactic events far differently than a Rebel, an outcast, or just the average citizen. And smugglers? They view every trip as a new opportunity. Every new world is a chance to beat the odds and strike it rich —or at least break even and live to see another run. The first thing most travelers need to realize is how enormous the galaxy truly is. There are an estimated four hundred billion stars in the galaxy. Most are unin­ habitable, and not every star system has only a single star. After a great deal of research, galactic cartogra­ phers and astronomers place the number of habitable systems at 3.2 billion. Of those, only 69 million or so .have sufficient population for Imperial membership, and, finally, only about 1.75 million planets are fully represented and integrated into the Galactic Empire. The next thing travelers should know is that only about twenty five percent of the galaxy has been for­ mally surveyed. While there are large regions of unex­ plored space—such as the Unknown Regions and the ever-shifting Wild Space areas, there are still vast, divid­ ed areas within Known Space that may have never had more than a single survey droid pass through in centu­ ries. Of course, the stars have been mapped from afar, even if not explored properly. Still, isolated pockets of unexplored space can be found throughout the galaxy, especially around star systems that are expected to be ■ uninhabitable, or isolated by natural interstellar features. Millions of habitable planets means a mind-bogglingly huge number of species exists in the galaxy. More than five million intelligent species are logged in Imperial da­ tabases. The vast majority have likely never engaged in interstellar travel or colonization on a large scale. How­ ever, given the availability of interstellar travel, and the multitudes using it, it is quite possible to regularly meet species one has never seen before. " Y o u w ill n e v e r f in d a m o r e w r e t c h e d h iv e o f s c u m a n d v illa in y . We m u s t b e c a u t io u s . " ' -Ben Kenobi THE GREAT HYPERLANES H yperspace travel is the driving force behind galactic civilization. Without it, interstellar travel would take far too long to support a galactic-scale government or trade system. Though its origins are buried in the ancient past, hyperdrives have been the firmly estab­ lished technology behind exploration, transportation, and warfare for centuries. Hyperspace itself is an alternate dimension that al­ lows starships to achieve speeds beyond the speed of light. However, such travel is inherently risky, and one cannot typically make a hyperspace jump in a straight line between two distant destinations. Objects of suffi­ cient mass, such as a planet or star, project correspond­ ingly sized hyperspace shadows that interfere with and endanger navigation. Eddies and other gravitational oddities also occur, especially in areas with a lot of gravi­ tational activity, such as the core of the galaxy. Ships straying too close to a mass shadow may be damaged, destroyed, or violently forced out of hyperspace. Com­ plicating matters is the fact that every star, planet, and object in the galaxy is constantly moving, making even a viable path dangerous the next time around. Safe hyperspace travel is best achieved through established hyperlanes or hyperroutes. These well- mapped routes are the backbone of galactic transpor­ tation and commerce. They are constantly monitored and mapped by agencies of the galactic government (currently the Imperial Space Ministry), and updated star maps are available at virtually any starport. Lesser known, illegal, secret, and smuggling routes also exist, and may be obtained through illicit, or at least private­ ly available, sources. Hyperspace travel without using a known route is possible, but slow and very dangerous. GRINNER’S GALAXY OF OPPORTUNITIES So, another 'independent merchant,’ huh? I’ve seen your type before. You’ve acquired a rickety ship and you're ecstatic to escape whatever dismal rock you came from. Maybe you owe someone money, maybe not...yet. Listen to me, you better learn how to get around the galaxy, and quick. Get to know one or more of the major hyperlanes, plus whatever regional and local trade routes serve your planets of choice. A good smuggler knows how to get the most out of his hyperdrive, and squeeze the best travel times out of the route in question. Your liveli­ hood, not to mention your lives, depend on it. Still interested? All right, sit down and let’s deal. The name is Grinner, one-time smuggler, full-time infochant. I’ve got leads for jobs in every part of Known Space, and to worlds beyond. Well find something you like. As safe routes change somewhat from trip to trip, hy­ perspace travel times correspondingly vary. Travel times are affected by the ship's hyperdrive speed (called a multiplier), the capability of the astrogator to plot an efficient path, the accuracy of the available star chart, and the natural ebbs and flows within hyperspace that affect each passage. Ships making parallel hyperspace jumps together are normally, but not always, affected by similar hyperspace conditions, making their arrival times and relative positions comparable to each other. MAJOR GALACTIC HYPERLANES The major hyperlanes have been in use for centuries. They are well traveled, well mapped, and connect to some of the most important sectors and systems in the galaxy. They are also the best patrolled, raising the stakes somewhat for smugglers, criminals, and others seeking to avoid government interference. The greatest routes are described below, along with a list of notable locations on or near the route. They are listed more or less from Coreward to Rimward (with the exception of the Hydian Way, which starts at its northernmost point, in relation to Galactic North). PERLEMIAN TRADE ROUTE At around 25,000 years old, the Perlemian Trade Route is one of the oldest and most well-traveled hyperlanes in the galaxy. It extended the early Republic deep into the northeastern quadrant of the galaxy, from Corus- cant out to Ossus and the Tion Cluster. It intersected with early connections to Hutt Space. It runs from Cor- uscant through the Tion Hegemony in the Outer Rim out to Wild Space. The Perlemian is one border of the Slice (see page 355), and its existence combined with regional political pressures led to a rapid colonization of the eastern side of the galaxy. It crosses the Hydian Way at Brentaal, and the Corellian Run at Coruscant (currently known as Imperial Center). Notable Locations: Coruscant (Imperial Center), Brentaal, Taanab, Roche, The Wheel, Ossus, Rhen Var, Felucia, Raxus, and the Tion Cluster. CORELLIAN RUN The Corellian Run was founded at about the same time as the Perlemian Trade Route, and constitutes the op­ posite border of the Slice. The Corellian Run helped establish Corellian influence in the early Republic, and maintains it in modern times. It remains one of the most important military and trade routes in the galaxy. The Corellian Run starts at Coruscant, bends around the Deep Core through much of the Core Worlds terri­ tory to Corellia, before extending as almost a straight shot to the Outer Rim, Ryloth, and beyond. Notable Locations: Coruscant (Imperial Center), Corellia, Duro, Gamorr, Bacrana, New Cov, Christoph- sis, Rodia, Tatooine, Geonosis, and Ryloth. CORELLIAN TRADE SPINE The earliest section of the Corellian Trade Spine con­ nected Corellia to Duro. Eventually, the route was ex­ tended to the southern end of the galaxy. As it leads to a less-developed and populated area of the galaxy, the Trade Spine is not as economically prosperous as other routes. Its southern tip leads to areas only recently explored in galactic terms. The Trade Spine intersects with the Rimma Trade Route at Yag’Dhul, and the Hydian Way at Terminus. Notable Locations: Corellia, Duro, Bestine, Yag’Dhul, Bespin, Hoth, and Terminus. RIMMA TRADE ROUTE The Rimma Trade Route serves a number of influential or otherwise important systems and sectors through­ out the southern areas of the galaxy. The Rimma was originally created by Tapani Sector merchants, blazing their way from the Colonies towards Abregado-rae in the Core Worlds and out to the distant Kathol Sector at the edge of the galaxy. The Herglic trade empire and the Tapani helped fuel expansion into the south­ ern regions. The Rimma intersects with the Corellian Trade Spine at Yag’Dhul, and the Hydian Way at strategically impor­ tant Eriadu. PLANETS, STAR SYSTEMS, SECTORS, AND REGIONS P lanets are typically the smallest political and cultural unit recognized by the galactic govern­ meant. Only the oldest and most powerful have their own Imperial Senator. Most have a plan­ etary governor who oversees the entire star sys­ tem, except in systems with multiple planets of significant population or influence. In the early days of the Republic, star systems were organized into sectors containing fifty worlds with a significant population, regardless of physical size. Nonstop exploration and colonization forced changes to the system to keep from overwhelming galactic governance. Under the Galactic Empire, sectors became more important as political units and for military organization. Groups of sectors were collected into Oversectors, allowing the Impe­ rial military to conduct operations across sectors with less political interference. Areas with active military campaigns became Priority Sectors. Regions are the largest territory designations in galactic governance. The term region varied from era to era, with some referring to areas later divided into sectors. In the Empire, the term re­ gion typically refers to a galactic-scale area of the galaxy, related to the expansion of galactic gov­ ernments. This includes vast areas such as the Core Worlds or Outer Rim. Notable Locations: Abregado-rae, Thyferra, Yag’Dhul, Sullust, Eriadu, Sluis Van, Dagobah, and Kal'Shebbol (Kathol Sector capital world). H YD IAN WAY The Hydian Way is the only major hyperlane to span the entire galactic disc. Pieced together from many smaller routes, the Hydian Way extends from the southern areas, through the Core Worlds, bends back to the northeast edge of the galaxy, and ends at the Corporate Sector. While the Hydian Way has fewer in­ fluential systems directly in its path, it links to many greater and lesser routes throughout the galaxy. It crosses the Perlemian Trade Route at Brentaal, the Corellian Run at Denon, the Rimma Trade Route at Eriadu, and the Corellian Trade Spine at Terminus. Notable Locations: Bonadan (Corporate Sector cap­ ital world), Telos, Mandalorian Space, Taris, Brentaal, Denon, Malastare, Eriadu, Mustafar, and Terminus. THE DEEP CORE T he Deep Core is the astronomically chaotic, star- packed region orbiting the massive black hole at the center of the galaxy. Given the high density of star sys­ tems and the extreme fluctuations in the gravitational field, hyperspace travel through the Deep Core is ex­ tremely difficult if not impossible, and always highly dangerous. Very few navigational routes exist, and most of them are closely guarded Imperial secrets. INTO THE CORE Given the difficulty in penetrating the Deep Core, ga­ lactic expansion naturally radiated outwards, along easier paths towards the rim and open space. While a few deep core systems are inhabited, most are not, or are too difficult to reach and survey. Despite the difficult location, a few Deep Core worlds had a great impact on galactic history. It is believed the origins of the Jedi and the Force came from one of the isolated Deep Core worlds. One of the galaxy's most influential systems in ancient times was Empress Teta, a major supplier of carbonite and one of the original sources of human expansion into the galaxy. However, for much of galactic history, the Deep Core was largely ignored by the rest of the galaxy. However, Chancellor Palpatine seized on the opportunity given by the Clone Wars to secretly scour the region for new hyperspace routes and usable worlds. He turned some of the data over to Separatist forces to launch a sur­ prise attack on Coruscant near the end of the conflict. The rest of the information he kept secret. It is rumored he silenced anyone involved in the scouting missions. Some of the Empire's most highly guarded secrets are the routes into the Deep Core. The Emperor es­ tablished the Deep Core Security Zone, making any travel illegal without the proper permits and autho­ rizations from the Imperial Security Bureau and the Bureau of Ships and Services (BoSS). Travel within the Deep Core is highly regulated and patrolled with extreme security. Only a handful of systems are ever open to receive hyperspace traffic, usually only a cou­ ple at a time. Known worlds are largely unpleasant and unlikely to draw the typical merchant or tourist traffic They include prison planets, industrial worlds, and indentured or enslaved mining colonies. Some systems have been secretly colonized by Im­ perial decree; many are heavily protected "fortress worlds.” Among these many presumed secrets is the planet Byss, deep in the heart of the Core. Byss is the Emperor’s personal retreat at the end of the ex­ tremely dangerous Byss Run hyperroute. Unknown to the galaxy at large, he trains acolytes and others in the ways of the dark side, and conducts disturbing experiments. Also along the route is Prakith, home to the Emperor's feared, Force-wielding High Inquisitors. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Deep Core, at or before the rise of the Empire. Byss: Byss is the Emperor’s ultra-secret personal re­ treat and foremost fortress world, located at the end the Byss Run. Access is highly regulated, and even knowing of the world’s existence is a death sentence. Most believe it is a myth or propaganda. Byss Run: This is a highly unstable and dangerous hyperspace route from Empress Teta to Byss, via Prakith. The Empire main­ tains navigational aids to keep the secret route vi­ able. Much of the Byss Run was used by General Grievous to attack Coruscant, using an unstable path starting beyond the Byss Run at Abregado-rae in the Core Worlds. Empress Teta system (Koros Major): Empress Teta is still a producer of carbonite, after thousands of years of mining and production. The Emperor’s Deep Core exploration efforts start in this system. It remains one of the more easily and frequently visited systems in the Deep Core. Koros Trunk Line: The ancient, main hyperroute for the majority of travelers into the Deep Core is the Koros Trunk Line. It has long been heavily used for transporting carbonite from Empress Teta to Coruscant and beyond. Prakith: This is the fortress world of the High Inquisi­ tors, housing their headquarters, the Citadel Inquisi- torius. Prakith is well defended in space and on the ground. High Inquisitors train and bring their unfortu­ nate prisoners to this world. Tython: Tython is a largely inaccessible planet where the Force was thought to have been originally discovered in the ancient past. Early worshipers of the light side left the planet to eventually become the first Jedi Knights. GRINNER'S DEEP CORE OPPORTUNITIES T h e D e e p C o re ? D o y o u h a v e a d e a th w is h ? T e ll y o u w h a t, I'll ju s t s h o o t y o u n o w and take your ship. It's the sam e result either w ay, except your ship doesn't go to w aste. Okay, listen, I don't know who put this idea in your head, but it's a bad one. First, the Deep Coore is a navigational nightmare. I don't care how good your navigator is, but dodging stars, unpredictable gravitational fields, andenormous black holes stacks the odds against you enormously. The whole region is a natural disaster area andhyperspace deathtrap, which is why nobody goes there.Well, it's the original reason nobody goes there. These days, nobody is allowed to go there. The Empirehas set up this thing called the Hyperspace Security Net to make sure no one gets into the Deep CoreSecurity Zone without his mighty majesty's permission. Rumor has it that the Security Net has interdictorships, minefields, and entire starfleets patrolling the few routes in . If you ask me, anything the Emperorwants to guard that badly? He can have it.P erm ission? S ure, it's possible, if you have the credits for outrageous fees, the tim e for Imperial bureaucracy, and preferably; some e sort of corporate or political backing. O h, also the Imperial Security Bureau will do a complete background check. I know you; you w on't pass. And if by some miracle you do, you'll fly by an Imperial schedule u sin g a ro u te a n d d e stinatio ns to their liking. If you stra y off course, they'll just kill you.Now, I've only head of two good reasons to brave all that. One is credits. Of course, if someone is pay- ing you that much, you will likely be up to something that the Imperials won't like. Still, I've heard they occasionally need pilots for plain old supply runs in there, so maybe it's possible. There's probably some plum corporate contract involved. I can look into it for you.The other reason is finding someone, or something. There were plenty of rumored prison planets and slave worlds in the Deep Core. Someone might hire you to break someone out, which is no small feat. More likely though, you'll be after someone you care about. All I can say is, do your homework, don't underestimate your chances, and good luck. Frankly, it's easier to just join the Imperial Navy. Now listen, I have much easier, and more profitable, opportunities out there than the Deep Core. Even working for the Hutts gives you a longer life expectancy. THE CORE WORLDS T he Core Worlds region is the governmental and cultur­ al center of the galaxy. For millennia, the Core Worlds were the heart'of the Republic, and they retain that sta­ tus under the Galactic Empire. The region consists of a semi-circular ring of star systems around the north, east, and south sides of the Deep Core. Every major hyper- lane starts in, or intersects with, the Core Worlds. CORE WORLD DOMINANCE The Core Worlds are among the most ancient civiliza­ tions of the Republic. From these central worlds, explo­ ration radiated outwards towards the rim of the galaxy. With it came governmental, societal, and economic ex­ pansion that Tunneled vast amounts of wealth back to the Core Worlds. These densely populated planets are among the most powerful in the galaxy. Much of the rest of the galaxy regards the Core Worlds .citizenry as aloof, snobbish, and elitist. This assessment is largely true, and is only bolstered by Core Worlder ar­ guments that everyone else is simply jealous of their stat­ ure and opportunities. Cultural, political, and-economic clashes between the galactic regions are common. While.political and economic conflicts are common occurrences throughout the history of the Core Worlds, large-scale warfare occurred far less often than in the outer regions of the galaxy. The citizens tend to think of themselves as largely protected from such displays of violence. These attitudes were shattered .in modern times by the Clone Wars, which brought the realities of interstellar warfare to the very cradle of the Republic. With the events of the Clone Wars manipulated by Chancellor Palpatine, he used the fear generated by the war to support his vision of peace through mili­ tary strength and a dominant central government. Thus, with the establishment of the Galactic Empire, the Core Worlds became its strongest supporters. Citizens tend to turn a blind eye towards-the darker side of the' Empire, often dismissing the worst stories as dissident or Rebel lies and propaganda.. Most ac­ tively support the Imperial cause and government. They remain ignorant of its worst evils, which Palpa­ tine takes great steps to obscure. Organizations like COMPNOR (Commission for the Preservation of the New Order) that actively support Imperial aims find popular support. The Core Worlds, and Coruscant (Imperial Center) in particular, are the greatest driver of the Imperial-bu­ reaucracy and.war machine. Spurred on equally by ide­ ological goals and economic gain, Core Worlds support has allowed Imperial power to permeate the region. Rebels, dissidents, sympathizers, and other outliers are ' not welcome, and security is generally tight and effec­ tive. Though opportunities exist for smugglers and pi­ rates, they are ruthlessly hunted down when detected. Many have tied to the lesser security or the outer re­ gions to ply their trade with a bit more safety. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Core Worlds, at or before the rise of the Empire. Abregado-rae: Located in the Borderlands region of the Core Worlds, Abregado-rae is a center of manu-' facturing and trade. Though it marks the start of the Rimma Trade Route, the system is not especially influ­ ential in galactic affairs. Alderaan: Alderaan was one of the original worlds of the Republic, a home to early human colonists. An influen­ tial player in galactic politics, Alderaan was a world of high culture for centuries. It became pacifist following the brutal Clone Wars, but overtly and secretly opposed the Emperor. Alderaan was destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to both intimidate the galactic citizenry into submission before the Empire, and to wrest the location of a secret Rebel base from Leia Organa. The rocky, shat­ tered remains of Alderaan are called the Graveyard. Brentaal: Brentaal benefits tremendously from its stra­ tegic location at the intersection of the Perlemian Trade Route and the Hydian Way. Brentaal IV is a wealthy world powered by an active trading center, extensive starports, broad manufacturing facilities, and galactic shipping. The Brentaal Houses firmly control the system thanks to their dominant position in galactic trade. Corellia: Corellia is the beneficiary and founder of two major hyperlanes that intersect the system, the Corellian Run and Corellia Trade Spine. It is an unusual planetary system, consisting of five inhabited worlds, two of which orbit the ancient and mysterious Center- point Station. Three species call Corellia home: Hu­ mans, Selonians and Drall. Corellia is famous for its shipyards and the free-spirited attitudes of its human citizens. See page 357 for more information. Corulag: Corulag is dedicated to Emperor Palpatine’s New Order. It is home to the prestigious Corulag Acade­ my, a highly acclaimed and sought-after military school. Coruscant (Imperial Center): Coruscant is the tra­ ditional capital of the Old Republic, and the heart of galactic culture and influence. Emperor Palpatine re­ named it Imperial Center after seizing power. While the black hole at the center of the Deep Core is the geographic center of the galaxy, the origin point for Republic and Imperial navigational charts remains Coruscant. The entire planet is covered in a dense ur­ ban cityscape, with the well-to-do living in the towers and upper levels, leaving the dregs of society to the ■ lower levels. It is the center of the Imperial power, the galactic bureaucracy, and many of the galaxy's most powerful economic institutions and corporations. Duro: Duro is homeworld to the Duros species. The Duros were among the earliest spacefaring societies, predating even the modern hyperdrive. They originat­ ed and blazed a great number of hyperroutes, include­ ing an early portion of the Corellian Trade Spine. They developed and colonized the systems they discovered to great economic effect. The surface of the planet became overwhelmed by industry and sprawling au­ tomated corporate farms. Due to the high pollution and terrible conditions, most Duros live in orbital cit­ ies or elsewhere off-world. Kuat: Kuat is home to the legendary Kuat Drive Yards, responsible for manufacturing starships throughout the history of the Republic, the Clone Wars, and the Galactic Empire. Completely ringed by an orbital stardock for starship manufacturing, Kuat produces thousands of ships a year, including the iconic Im­ perial Star Destroyer. Hundreds of millions of work­ ers inhabit the orbital ring. Given the system's great strategic importance, the Empire maintains a massive presence in-system and around the region. Access to the system is highly controlled. Ralltiir: Ralltiir is best known for its extensive bank­ ing system, as well as its attempts to remain politi­ cally neutral. Before the Battle of Yavin, agents and factions secretly attempted to guide its influential financial markets towards Imperial support. After Rebel sympathizers tried to counter the Imperial actions, the Empire invaded, seizing direct control. Since that time, the system has become the target of Rebel raids and covert operations. While the Empire retains control, Ralltiir’s financial institutions have been greatly damaged. Rendili: Rendili supports one of the galaxy's largest starship producers, Rendili Star Drive. Rendili sided with the Separatists during the Clone Wars, but its support was inhibited by its Home Fleet’s loyalty to the Republic. Chancellor Palpatine used the crisis to bring such fleets under more direct governmental control. However, the system’s disloyalty ultimately hurt Rendili Star Drive, as it received no lucrative Im­ perial contracts. GRINNER’S CORE WORLD OPTIONS Now, the Core Worlds. Lots of opportunities there for a crafty freighter captain, such as yourself. Sure, the Imperials like to make everyone think the region is locked down tight. It makes the residents feel safe, you know, better to keep them under control, like good little Imperial citizens. Well, it's a bit like that. Security is a lot tighter. Customs officials are a lot more effective. You certainly don’t want to hang around on an Imperial world any longer than you have to, especially if you have a few warrants out there. Imperial detention facilities are not fun, let me tell you. However, all of that security and bureaucracy opens up new markets for people like you and me. Somebody always needs some restricted goods, or outright illegal items smuggled to them, and they'll have to pay extra to avoid Imperial issues. If you've got some morals, you'll find that a lot of perfectly normal goods are illegal for various reasons on Imperial worlds. Of course, since those reasons are often political, you’ll need to avoid any apparent connection to the Rebels. So, here's what I have right now. The first one is a bit morbid. I've got a family of Alderaan survivors who want to make a trip to the Graveyard to pay their respects. This one isn’t so much illegal as it is risky. The remains of Alderaan haven’t had time to stabilize their orbits, and won’t for years to come. Just don’t get too close, and you'll be fine. Sometimes an ISB ship or two’s in the area, trying to ID anyone who shows up and check them out later. Don't hang around. This next one is a fairly standard contraband run into Brentaal. With all the merchant activity around the system, you’d quickly become just another ship in the spacelanes. You’ll have to deal with customs, of course, but it’s high-paying and it shouldn’t be too hard for you to pick up a legitimate cargo for the trip back out. This last one is pretty dangerous. It seems that one of the wealthier banking officials wants to sneak his family off of Ralltiir. At the very least, that means they have reasons to avoid the Imperials. They might be wanted criminals, but I’d be willing to bet they’ve been tagged as Rebel sympathizers. If they were agents, they wouldn’t be looking for this kind of help. Whichever you choose, just make sure your ship’s licenses and identification are legal, or at least able to withstand close scrutiny. Chances are good you’ll run into some kind of Imperial officials, if nothing more than the customs officers who inevitably greet you at most every starport. Don't forget to watch your back. ISB agents love to root out threats to the New Order, Rebel or not. THE COLONIES T he Colonies form the first ring of major galactic ex­ ploration and expansion beyond the Core Worlds. The Colonies are the second most densely populated region after the Core Worlds themselves, and magni­ tudes greater than the galaxy at large. The Colonies extend in a semicircular pattern around the similarly explored Core Worlds region. Settlement of the Colonies started before the es­ tablishment of the Republic. Explorers and colonists extended the power and ambition of the Core Worlds from which they came. Primitive generation ships pre­ dated hyperspace capable craft, making the coloniza­ tion effort all the more remarkable. Due to the limi­ tations of travel and communications, many worlds broke away from their original rulers within a few gen­ erations. The ongoing conflicts between the Colonies and their home worlds proved to be a driving force in the establishment of a galactic government. COLONIAL POWER Though the region still struggles for the prestige it feels it deserves, the Colonies hold some of the wealthi­ est worlds in the galaxy. Compared to the outer ter­ ritories, the Colonies are culturally advanced and an economic powerhouse in their own right, though the Core is reluctant to ever acknowledge this fact. The region has long been the source of political strife and change in the history of the Republic. The Colonies believe themselves to be at the economic forefront in the galaxy, combining the power and wealth with the raw materials needed throughout the galaxy. With the development of the Colonies came the advancement of galactic standards and laws aimed towards curbing abuses of power both governmental and corpo­ rate. Much of this was due to major galactic struggles often erupting from conflicts with and within the Colo­ nies themselves. Due to this reputation, the Galactic Empire keeps careful watch over the region, dealing harshly with any troublesome areas, so as not to let anti-government sentiment grow into a major threat to Imperial power. A great percentage of Colonies' megacorporations and other operations greatly ben­ efit from Imperial contracts orchestrated to keep the region happy and under control. These efforts keep the region in line, but have not stopped a growing resentment towards the Imperial government that is building beneath the surface. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Colonies, at or before the rise of the Empire. Arkania: A cold, tundra-covered world located between the Perlemian Trade Route and the Hydian Way, Arkania is the home world of the native Arkanians and their ge­ netically modified off-shoots, who are treated as lesser beings. The Arkanians are scientifically minded, but of­ ten unscrupulous in their dealings and experiments. Balmorra: Located at the very edge between the Colonies and the Core Worlds, Balmorra is a heavily industrialized world. Known for producing arms for the Imperial Army, Balmorra is one of the primary manufacturing locations for the AT-ST walker. Byblos: Another major manufacturer of military equipment, Byblos is a heavily populated world on the Corellian Run. The planet’s unique architecture GRINNER'S COLONIAL PROSPECTS features enormous towers of up to 5,000 levels, with each tower dedicated to a specific function. The world is also known for Byblos Drive Yards, producing air speeders and other flying vehicles. Cato Neimoidia: Though it is an independent colony, Cato Neimoidia is best known as a Neimoidian “purse world." Cato Neimoidia was one of the wealthiest planets in the galaxy, but its status suffered a ma­ jor setback when Republic forces captured it during the Clone Wars. Until then, it was a major Separatist stronghold. The world is known for its bridge cities, underslung from enormous, natural rock arches. Commenor: Commenor is well known for its inde­ pendent spirit. As such, the Rebel Alliance has es­ tablished a secret starfighter training facility on Folor, Commenor's largest moon. Devaron: Devaron is the homeworld of the Devaro- nians, located near the Corellian Trade Spine. It is a mountainous world, covered with deep valleys, lakes, and major rivers. Devaronian females tend to remain on their homeworld, while the males wander their planet or the galaxy at large. Fondor: Fondor is known primarily for its orbital ship­ yard. The Empire seized these facilities and is nearly finished building Darth Vader’s new flagship, the Su­ per Star Destroyer Executor. Ghorman: Located along the Rimma Trade Route, Ghorman is best known as the site of a major, public Imperial atrocity. In response to an anti-tax demonstration, the Imperial commander Wilhuff Tarkin landed the ship sent to collect the taxes on top of the demonstrators. Tarkin was promoted to Ah, the Colonies. There's a lot of wealth tied up in these worlds, and they're not afraid to spend it. Now don't get too excited. The Empire is still very active here, as well as plenty of local authorities. So you have to be careful. The trick to a successful run in the Colonies is usually to appear as legitimate as possible. It's not that they don't like fringers and hard working merchants, but they respond much better to those they see as success- ful, even if they suspect otherwise. My recommendation? Dress the part. Clean up your ship. Maybe invest insome crew uniforms, or at least leave the ratty jumpsuits in your quarters. First impressions matter greatly tosome customers, especially those you might take on as passengers. Plus it helps impress custom officials. It's surprising how many smugglers think their piece of junk starship is just the thing to go unnoticed, when a well-kept vessel can deter all manner of uncomfortable questioning. With all of that money floating around, it's not tremendously difficult to find some kind of work; especially if you don't mind standard fetch-and-carry jobs. Speaking of, first on my list is a request to covertly transport some rare biological specimens out to a medicalresearch lab on Arkania. It has some advanced preservation technology, but don't you worry about that. The passenger escorting the device will keep it running during the trip. Of course, it must be something less than legal, or they would just hire a shipping company. This one is a bit unusual. It looks like one of the wealther Neimoidian Politicians is relocating to Cato Neimoidia and needs transport to haul his considerable belongings. However, from the sound of it, he's actually looking for someone like you to work as decoys for the actual moving vessels. I guess he has some enemies, or he's just trying to throw off the ISB while moving some kind of illegal collection. Either way it's risky, but pays very well. If your crew's willing to do a good deed and get paid for it, I hear there's a wealthy, free Herglic merchant willing to hire mercenaries to free certain individuals from slave compounds in old Herglic Space. I'm no Rebel sympathizer, but even I abhor the Ghorman tragedy. I hear they're trying to make this year’s dem- onstrations quite the show, which is bound to stir up more trouble. There's definitely a few Rebel agents on the planet now, and they're likely looking for people who can cause trouble or stir up a crowd. Or if you’re out to make a credit at their expense, I bet they come with high bounties. Now, back on the legal side of things, I know you can regularly pick up passengers at Mrlsst between sessions at the universities. They are usually just looking to hitch a ride back to their various home worlds However sometimes you get the unusual research student who needs a lift to somewhere really exotic or dangerous. the rank of Moff. The event serves as a rallying cry against the Empire. Giju: Giju is the homeworld of the Herglics and the center of their pre-Republic empire. They once colo­ nized and controlled systems around their home- world, stretching into the Inner Rim. Their influence extended along the Rimma Trade Route. Although the Herglics were one of the first species to join the Re­ public, the Empire has essentially enslaved them. Mrlsst: Mrlsst is a swampy planet known for its uni­ versities. It lies at the edge of Tapani Space. THE INNER RIM O riginally called just the Rim when first opened for exploration and settlement in the early Republic, the Inner Rim gained its current name after scouts continued into the Expanded Rim, now known as the Expansion Region, The shape of the populated area is roughly semi-circular, with a northeastern bulge and narrowed eastern zone in the Slice, between the Trel- len Trade Route and the Corellian Run. The Inner Rim marks the original boundary of civilized, explored space. In its early days, it was the great frontier: raw and rugged. Corporate concerns and rapid colonization quickly pushed the frontier further out, actually distorting the shape of the Inner Rim region in the process. Those avoiding the corpo­ rate exploitation of the Expanded Rim also avoided the eastern edge, creating the northeastern bulge. It wasn’t long before the Inner Rim was well within the realm of Republic commerce and politics. INNER TURMOIL The Inner Rim holds a great variety of worlds, many in major agricultural and industrial roles. Within the Slice, population density is actually similar to the Col­ onies, but drops off quickly in other areas. Culturally speaking, the Inner Rim is the dividing line between the core of the galaxy and the outlying sectors. As such, the residents are a bit unique in the galaxy, looking up at the Core regions, and down on their ever distant neighbors. Like the Colonies, the citizens of the Inner Rim harbor a well-known undercurrent of jealousy for their neighbors close to the Core. Despite its distance from the Galactic Core, the Inner Rim holds some of the most sought after goods in the galaxy. Two main sources of critical healing substances are found in this region. These are Manaan for kolto (es­ pecially in the ancient Republic), and Thyferra for bacta. The region is also an important industrial zone. The re­ Namadii Corridor: The Namadii Corridor is an im­ portant hyperspace route between Coruscant (Impe­ rial Center) and Bilbringi in the Inner Rim. Neimoidia: This is the Neimoidian homeworld, origi­ nally colonized by the Duros. The world is regularly overlooked or upstaged by the nearby Core Worlds, much to the Neimoidian's disdain. Procopia: Procopia is the capital world and heart of the old Tapani Empire, and now serves the same role for the Tapani Sector. Located in the southern reaches of the Colonies, the Tapani sector still exerts economic and political influence throughout the area. gion is strategically important, and wars have been a regular problem throughout the Inner Rim’s history. Some of the earliest secessionist fighting in the Clone Wars erupted at the Cotal home system of Antar. It lies near the eastern, narrowed region, bordering future Separatist territory and an extension of Hutt Space in the adjacent Expansion Region. The southern por­ tion of the Inner Rim harbored the closest border of continuous Separatist space towards the core regions. Centered around the intersection of the Rimma Trade Route and Corellian Trade Spine, this end of Separate­ ist space started at Bestine and Thyferra, and followed the Rimma all the way out to Elrood in the Outer Rim. Under Imperial control, Inner Rim worlds are regu­ larly under martial law, or threatened to become so in the near future. The Empire keeps a close watch and has not forgotten, or forgiven, the systems with a Sep­ aratist past. More and more of the local population are becoming fed up with the increasingly oppressive conditions. Significant numbers are relocating to the less regulated Expansion Region. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Inner Rim, at or before the rise of the Empire. Antar: The Cotal homeworld of Antar IV has a high­ ly unusual orbital pattern around a gas giant, which greatly varies its reception of light on any given day. The Cotals are well adapted to their unique condi­ tions. There is generally no organized central govern­ meant. The Empire has not forgotten that a Separate­ ist movement fought an early battle here before the Clone Wars, as well as maintained a base on Antar IV. Bestine: Once regarded as yet another nondescript colony world, Bestine is now well known as a target and instigator of Rebel activity. A few years ago, the Empire forcibly removed the established colony to convert the system into a new naval shipyard. By betraying promises made to the relocated colonists, the Empire has turned the system into a rallying and recruitment point for Rebel agents, as well as a legiti­ mate military target. GRIIMIMER’S INNER RIM RECOMMENDATIONS These days, the Inner Rim may as well be code for Imperial martial law. Not every planet has a re­ strictive Imperial presence, just most of the ones you actually want to visit. It’s not like the locals want it that way; many wish the Empire would lay off and mind its own business. The problem is, the Empire makes everything its business. Now, you’ll start to see more variety in the wealth and success of various worlds. Some are quite rich and successful, while others barely scrape by or have failed altogether. You’ll also notice a lot less traffic out here. There are still plenty of densely populated planets, but they are much more spread out. Let's run down the job list. First, I've got Denon, the Inner Rim’s answer to Coruscant. It’s big, ur­ ban, and frankly, a bit boring. I can set you up with most any standard shipping or smuggling run. Next is something of a mercy mission. Ever since the colonists were uprooted from Bestine by the Empire, they've been trying to work out their next move. I’ve got a few families who need a lift out to the Expansion Region. Maybe they know something I don’t, or more likely someone I don’t, but the Expansion Region just isn’t exactly looking for new workers these days. If you take them, prepare a backup plan. They might end up on your ship longer than you expect. Last is Thyferra. How would you like to do some bacta smuggling? Sure, bacta is legal, but if you can avoid the Bacta Cartel, it’s a whole lot more profitable. If you get your hands on it, you can offload it for a huge profit at most any out-of-the- way planet or world under bacta embargo. Just remember, those Thyferrians are a touchy bunch. Be sure to be polite to your contact. Bilbringi: Bilbringi holds a famous and well-defend­ ed orbital Imperial shipyard in an otherwise lifeless star system. Denon: Located on the Corellian Run, Denon is a completely urbanized world. It resembles Coruscant, but with much less power and prestige. Hapes: Hapes gives its name to a cluster of stars and an ancient world not far from the Perlemian Trade Route. Isolated from surrounding space by gas and ionized particles, Hapes is largely autonomous, stand­ ing apart from the Empire, as it did in the Republic. See page 354 for more information. Manaan: Manaan is the water-covered homeworld of the aquatic Selkath species. Since the Old Republic, Manaan has been the only known source of kolto, a strong healing substance. In modern times, Manaan is better known as a resort world. Now under Imperial control, rumors whisper that the resort is actually a cover for Imperial activity. Myrkr: Myrkr is a highly obscure world. Those in the know regard it as a smuggler’s stopover or decent world to hide from just about anybody. The trees have a natural metal content that makes sensor scans dif­ ficult. Myrkr’s greatest secret is that it is home to the ysalamiri. Though virtually unknown to the galaxy, a ysalamiri naturally repels the Force, completely defeat­ ing the Force abilities of Force sensitive individuals. Onderon: Onderon is a planet covered in wild, le­ thal jungles. It has a single, huge, fortified settlement called Iziz built to hold back the wild monsters. It also has an ancient reputation for savagery and evil. One of Onderon’s moons, Dxun, holds the tomb of the an­ cient Sith Lord Freedom Nadd. Dxun actually passes close enough to Onderon to form an atmospheric bridge between the worlds at certain times. Taanab: Taanab is an agricultural world and exporter of foodstuffs. The planet is most famous for the re­ cently reported “ Battle of Taanab,” where Lando Calrissian creatively defeated pirates who annually raided the world. Thyferra: Thyferra is the homeworld of the Vratix species, the inventors of bacta. With the rise of the Empire, two corporations called Xucphra and Zaltin negotiated a deal with the Imperial government to control virtually all of the galaxy’s bacta. The human- owned companies dominate the world government, and are collectively known as the Bacta Cartel. Yag’Dhul: Yag’Dhul is the bizarre homeworld of the equally unusual Givin species. The planet’s three moons and complex orbit results in extreme tidal forces that expose portions of the plant to hard vacuum. This gave rise to the Givin’s unique physiology to resist such con­ ditions, and their natural abilities as shipbuilders and mathematicians. The system is at the intersection of the Corellian Trade Spine and the Rimma Trade Route. THE EXPANSION REGION T he Expansion Region is one of the galaxy’s primary regions for manufacturing and heavy industry. The region underwent extreme corporate development and extensive mining over the centuries. With a signif­ icant percentage of the mines played out, the region has suffered economically for the past few centuries. The Expansion Region has an irregular shape, with a very thin band in the northern reaches of the region and a wider bulge in the eastern and southeastern areas. The population density of the region is far less than the Core Worlds, or even the Inner Rim. While the Inner Rim was still developing, explorers and corporate opportunists surged into the Expand­ ed Rim. A boom was well under way before it was officially opened for colonization. They quickly estab­ lished major mining colonies and industrial complex­ es on the worlds they seized. The operations were so disruptive they distorted the shape of the Inner Rim region, producing its northeastern bulge. ECONOMIC FLUX Eventually renamed the Expansion Region, further exploration and development became an experiment in corporate governance and control. Mega corpora­ tions and guilds controlled entire star systems and clusters, efficiently stripping them of any usable ma­ terial for direct shipping back to the inner regions, or to local industrial and manufacturing complexes. Wars were also a concern in the early years. The conflicts changed the exploration and settlement ef­ forts, pushing them further westward in the region. Eventually, these more successful and diverse sectors sought to culturally distance themselves and-called their area the Trailing Sectors. The northern sectors lagged in development. In re­ sponse, the Republic granted their development and governing rights to the Expansionist Oligarchy. The corporate conglomerates that made up the Oligarchy severely abused their power, reducing the citizenry to near-poverty conditions. Once the scandal broke, the Senate removed the Oligarchy from power. Similar situ­ ations played out across the Expansion Region over the centuries. Corporate control gave way to Republic representation in most systems, though the companies still exert extensive influence. The experiment led to the development of the Corporate Sector (see page 352). In recent centuries, the mines of the original colonies in the Slice region played out, plunging the area into an unstoppable economic decline. The systems and corporations struggle with what remains and they are unlikely to regain the industrial power they once enjoyed. During the Clone Wars, large areas of space in the southern and Slice sectors became Separatist holdings. Able to take advantage of the economic troubles, the Separatists made significant inroads in regional politics.. After the establishment of the Empire, an influx of im­ migrants and refugees from the Inner Rim has created new opportunities for the citizenry. Unfortunately, they also add to the economic woes and unemployment is­ sues already rampant. After the war, the Empire moved to stabilize the economic situation by creating major staging areas for Imperial cargo and military fleets. This included efforts to relocate portions of the population, as well as to take advantage of Inner Rim refugees. The economic revival in those areas helped draw support for the Empire among the population. However, the Rebel Alliance has found the disused mining operations and abandoned worlds are ready-made for secret opera­ tions. The Rebels are making inroads with those suffer­ ing the worst of the economic situation. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Expan­ sion Region, at or before the rise of the Empire. Bacrana: Bacrana is home to one of the Imperial Navy’s largest regional staging areas, as well as one of the megacorporations that controls many of the local systems. The Rebels are highly active in the sector, with a secret base and training facility. They have tak­ en increasingly bolder action since the Battle of Yavin. Cathar: Cathar is the homeworld of the species of the same name. Cathar is best known for suffering a dev­ astating attack during the ancient Mandalorian Wars, before the world became a member of the Republic. The feline-like Cathar live in large city-trees. Dorin: Dorin is the home planet of the Kel Dor spe­ cies. Black holes greatly restrict hyperspace travel in the area. Dorin’s atmosphere is toxic to most off world species, and the Kel Dor themselves wear breath masks and protective eyewear off-world. Iktotchon: Iktotchon is the homeworld of the Iktot- chi species. Known for their precognitive abilities, they foresaw the conditions of the new Empire. Many returned to Iktotchon to escape the dark times, and new orbital colonies were built to accommodate those returning to the system. The Empire has block­ added the system, but both sides seem content to avoid further confrontation. Kinyen: Kinyen is the homeworld of the Gran, where they maintained a meticulously balanced, peaceful civilization for millennia. Access to Kinyen was highly restricted for non-Gran. As such, they initially resist­ ed Imperial demands to full access to their world. In response, the Imperials ordered an orbital bombard­ meant. The Gran relented, but some have joined the Rebel Alliance in response. Tierfon: Tierfon is home to an active but secret un­ derground Rebel starfighter outpost. GRINNER’S EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES The first thing you have to understand is that most of the eastern sectors are in terrible eco­ nomic shape. The megacorporations are suffering greatly, after sucking system after system dry of any usable material. On top of that, I’ve heard it's developing a significant Rebel problem, causing all kinds of havoc. Now, the Empire has taken an active role in prop­ ping up some systems and sectors. That means that the better functioning planets are often Im­ perial strongholds. It’s working, but it’s a stopgap measure. The main problem is, it’s impossible to rejuvenate a mine that has completely played out. So, unless someone comes up with a new way to generate credits, I expect the region to continue its downward spiral. Even so, there are good credits to be made if you know where to look. The downturn's opened the door to criminal organi­ zations like never before in this region. I've heard of violent turf wars around Bacrana, and that's with the Imperial fleet in-system. Speaking of, you want to try to avoid the Imperial staging areas, unless you’re an authorized shipping agent. With the uptick in Rebel attacks, they’re feeling a bit jumpy these days, and I doubt you can handle too much Imperial scrutiny. So, that might be the best place to start. Get on with one of the local criminal syndicates. They're always searching for good smugglers, hired guns, and bound­ ty hunters. Also, remember a lot of these systems are essentially company towns. Citizens jump at the chance to buy legitimate goods not available in com­ pany stores. If you're really clever, you can undercut the company prices with similar or cheaper goods from elsewhere. Of course, most companies take a dim view to competition. THE MID RIM T he Mid Rim opened for colonization after the Ex­ pansion Region’s booming growth died down. It is known as a relatively peaceful and somewhat boring region of the galaxy. The eastern areas of the region (within the Slice) developed first, with the northern and southern regions growing significantly after the opening of the Hydian Way. The region’s eastern side is significantly wider than the northern and southern portions. The northern area is barely connected to the rest of the region. The eastern edge borders Hutt Space, which intruded into the Mid Rim significantly at times. Population density is significantly lighter than any of the interior regions. Unlike its Coreward neighbor, the Mid Rim enjoyed a relatively organized and lengthy colonization pe­ riod. While the corporations plundered the Expan­ sion Region, a different type of colonist arrived in the Mid Rim. Some were idealistic organizations, such as religious groups or ambitious, radical political groups. The Mid Rim enjoyed effective governance and general security, thanks in no small part to the simultaneous opening of the Outer Rim to coloniza­ tion. Those avoiding or fleeing Republic interference opted for the more distant Outer Rim, bypassing Mid Rim worlds completely. MIDDLE OF THE PACK Much of the Mid Rim remains unexplored, or only nominally surveyed. Inhabited systems tend to be clustered around the major hyperlanes. While the re­ gion has a reputation for relative peace, the vast open areas allow pirates to operate more easily than in the central regions. Pirates have been a major problem in the region for centuries. During the Clone Wars, much of the eastern Mid Rim territory within the Slice was dominated by Sepa­ ratists. The conflict allowed a temporary incursion of Hutt influence and control. Some areas remained contested between the two factions for the duration of the war. Other Separatist space bounded several of the major hyperlanes. They held the northeastern end of the Perlemian Trade Route, starting in the out­ er area of the Mid Rim. They held the central stretch of the Corellian Run and the entirety of the Rimma Trade Route as it passed through the Inner Rim. Areas outside of Separatist space were not immune to the war, as both sides pushed for greater control, by both political and military means. Despite the region’s substantial Separatist influ­ ence and support during the war, it has been re­ markably loyal to the Empire. The northern stretch­ es had no significant Separatist space, and many areas and systems in the southern and southeast­ ern portions remained loyal to the Republic, even in the face of Separatist threats and attacks. Imperial m ilitary efforts to crack down on piracy win a lot of Mid Rim support. After years of fighting, much of the Mid Rim enjoys the relative return of peace under Imperial control. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Mid Rim, at or before the rise of the Empire. Ando: Ando is the water world home of the Aqualish species, living on small islands and floating cities. Ando sided with the Separatists in the Clone Wars and is now ruled by the Empire as a police state. Bimmisaari: Bimmisaari is the homeworld of the Bimms, which are two different but peaceful and co­ operative species that share the same name. One species evolved on Bimmisaari while the other is a near-Human strain. Bimms are merchants, scholars, and artists. Bothawui: Bothawui is the homeworld of the Bothan species and center of Bothan Space. Some say the influence of the Bothan Spynet is one of the reasons for the Mid Rim’s long-term peacefulness and stabil­ ity. While Bothawui stays neutral during the Galactic Civil War, its spynet secretly serves the Rebels. Boz Pity: Long used as a graveyard world by regional systems, Boz Pity gained notoriety due to the Outer Rim Sieges during the Clone Wars. The Confederacy of Independent Systems kept a significant starfleet in the system. Regional worlds continue to bring their dead to Boz Pity. Centares: Centares is an industrial trade world at the edge of Inner Rim space, used as a kickoff point for those headed into the wilder areas of the Outer Rim. Cerea: Cerea is a relative paradise, peaceful and re­ mote. Cereans live in harmony with nature, while visi­ tors reside in technologically enabled compounds. Falleen: Falleen is the homeworld of the reclusive species of the same name. An Imperial world, a major city on Falleen suffered an Imperial orbital bombard­ meant to stave off and destroy a lethal biological agent that escaped from an Imperial lab. The Falleen resent the Empire for these events. Iridonia: Iridonia is the homeworld of the Zabrak spe­ cies. Due to the extremely harsh environmental condi­ tions, such as hugely powerful storms and lethal seas, many Zabrak have relocated to other worlds. It was once the site of a Sith training academy. GRINNER’S MIDDLE PITCH To hear those from the Core talk, you’d think that the Mid Rim is nothing more than a few slightly interesting systems scattered amongst the vast unsettled territory. While a lot of Mid Rim residents might share that assessment, they're quick to point out the region's biggest threat: pirates. Even with centuries of exploration and colonization, there just hasn't been enough time or people to fully develop the entire expanse. I would guess a significant portion of the unexplored area of the known galaxy is in the Mid and Outer Rims. That leaves a lot of room for pirates to operate with little interference, and a lot of places to hide out. Now, if you're experienced combatants, mercenaries, or private security, I can line you up with a few settle­ ments in need of a little extra firepower. Some of these are just temporary assignments, but a few of them I bet you could turn into a long-term contract. Remember, though, although some of their problems are local riffraff, you may end up trading blaster bolts with well-armed raiders. If you have a decently armed starship, there is no shortage of convoy duties for shipping companies or individual merchants. It helps if you have a decent reputation. By that I mean a resume they can check up on. Too many of these ships have been raided by their own escorts over the years. If you're looking to make some trades or maybe a bit of gambling, I'd recommend heading out to the Wheel space station. It has the distinction of being devoid of Imperials, though I'd bet ISB keeps more than a few undercover agents around. Ithor: Ithor is the homeworld of the Ithorian species. They live in herd cities, floating above the surface of their world, which they consider sacred. Ithor is a center for botanical and biological based trade, which is extended through the use of their spacefaring herdships. Kashyyyk: Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wook- iees, is a world of extremely dense forests, with trees thousands of meters tall. The Wookiees live mainly in the treetops, as Kashyyyk’s ecology tends to be­ come more lethal the closer one gets to the forest floor. Kashyyyk was a battleground during the Clone Wars. After the war, the Empire officially occupied the planet, enslaving the Wookiees and shipping them off-world for manual labor and construction projects. Malastare: Malastare is a world on the Hydian Way shared by several sentient species, including Gran and Dugs. The Gran live in urban areas, while the Dugs live among the trees and wilder lands. The Gran regard and use the Dugs as a labor force. Naboo: Naboo is the homeworld of the Gungans, but largely ruled by a human government. It is the origin world of Emperor Palpatine, Queen Amidala, and oth­ ers who played significant roles in the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. Naboo is a subjugated world and features one of Palpatine’s private retreats. However, enemies of the Empire continue their secret resistance activities. Ord Mantell: Ord Mantell sought to remain apart from Imperial interests. It lies at the juncture of two lesser hyperroutes. See page 361 for information. Roche: Roche is the home system of the insec- toid Verpine species, which lives in a massive as­ teroid field. The Empire has virtually enslaved the Verpine for their expert engineering skills, which fuel the Imperial military industrial machine. Im­ perials are stationed within the Roche asteroid field to make sure the Verpine remain in line. Ruusan: Ruusan is an ordinary world of the Min­ ing Guild with a major role in Jedi history. A mil­ lennium ago, the Sith were essentially destroyed as a major force in the galaxy for hundreds of years. The Brotherhood of Darkness was con­ sumed by a thought-bomb at the last battle of Ruusan during the Light and Darkness War. The location is now known as the Valley of the Jedi. Ubrikkia: Ubrikkia is the manufacturing center for the famous Ubrikkian Industries and its subsidiaries. Repulsorlift vehicles, military craft, droids, and more come from various Ubrikkian factories. The Wheel: The Wheel is an aptly named, enormous wheel-shaped space station located on the Perlemian Trade Route, known for its casinos and gladiatorial arenas. Ships of most any size may dock with the sta­ tion. At this time, the Wheel enjoys a special kind of immunity, and Imperial ships are not allowed to ap­ proach. The station pays taxes to the Empire to main­ tain its current status. THE OUTER RIM TERRITORIES T he Outer Rim Territories are the outermost official regions in Known Space. They are by far the most expansive and least explored areas, a wide swath of space, tracing the rim three-quarters of the way around the galaxy. The area’s extreme distance from Coruscant and the Core Worlds has always been both a great asset and major hindrance to its prosperity, political fortunes, economic development, and securi­ ty. As with the Republic before it, Imperial control and influence varies greatly from system to system, and sector to sector. The region’s reputation for lawless­ ness and danger is well deserved, but is often simply not the case in highly developed systems and sectors. Despite its remoteness, the Outer Rim has played a significant role in galactic politics, economics, and warfare since ancient times well before the origins of the Republic. The expanding Hutts clashed with the Tion Hegemony and Xim the Despot before the Perle­ mian Trade Route connected Coruscant to the region. Since that time, exploration and colonization of the territories has been irregular and haphazard. The rate of Outer Rim exploration was closely tied with the extension of the major hyperlanes into the furthest reaches of the galaxy. The earliest develop­ meant expanded from the Perlemian Trade Route in the northeastern quadrant, around the Jedi world of Ossus and the Tion Hegemony. The presence of Hutt Space slowed and deterred colonization of the Slice, driving colonists to seek worlds away from Hutt influence and interference. Similarly, difficulties with various Sith and Mandalorian attacks and invasions disrupted development of the northern area. Explora­ tion picked up in the southern reaches with the extent­ sion of the Rimma Trade Route, the Corellian Trade Spine, and the Hydian Way. Republic control over the Outer Rim varied greatly over the ages, and each system was often responsible for its own security. Power struggles between regional factions, isolationist systems, and militant species all contributed to the difficulties of maintaining order in the Outer Rim. Beyond that, significant criminal en­ terprises found a great haven in the Outer Rim, some­ times officially sanctioned by corrupt and disreputa­ ble governments and corporations. OUTER REACHES Chancellor Palpatine used the Outer Rim as a great game board in his bid to take total control of the Re­ public. Using the politics of Outer Rim trade conflicts to propel himself into becoming Chancellor, Palpatine then orchestrated the Clone Wars through the cre­ ation of the Separatist movement. This enabled him to oversee the creation of a powerful central govern­ meant and military, to counter the growing Separatist threat in the Outer Rim. The Clone Wars greatly disrupted political control in the Outer Rim. The Hutts took advantage of the situ­ ation to extend Hutt Space to cover more than three quarters of the Outer Rim portion of the Slice. The Sep­ aratists controlled most of the rest, plus about half of the northern reaches. They also held a large continuous region along the Hydian Way and Rimma Trade Route. After the war, the Empire used its ever-growing mili­ tary might to reestablish control over significant areas in the Outer Rim. The Hutts were pushed back to their traditional holdings, more or less. Outer Rim citizens of­ ten welcomed the return of civilized trade and transport. However, some systems and sectors benefited more than others. Some felt the oppressive actions all too common within the Empire. Over time, Imperial political realities, interference, and military interventions started to wear thin on the independent-minded Outer Rim residents. Rebel sympathy generally runs greatest in the Outer Rim. However, given the hugely diverse civiliza­ tions, species, and geography, there is no consensus. Worlds that fare extremely well under the Empire en­ thusiastically support Imperial Center, For the most remote fringe worlds, little has changed with the rise of the Empire. They must rely on themselves for their own security and destiny. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Outer Rim, at or before the rise of the Empire. Bakura: Bakura is a self-sufficient, remote world es­ tablished by the Bakura Corporation. It was temporar- THE MAW N ear the planet of Kessel lies a mysterious cluster of black holes known as the Maw or the Maw Cluster. Nearly un-navigable, this region is somewhat unstable and has created the conditions that make the Kessel Run so dangerous. However, it is theorized by many scholars of galactic history that one of the ma­ jor Pre-Hyperspace Era races must have been involved with the creation of the Maw, for the placement of the black holes—and the fact that they have not merged together—strongly suggests that it is not a natural formation. The remote nature of the Maw and its nearly inac­ cessible nature has made it attractive to the Empire, and many secret facilities have been placed there at the Emperor’s command. ily used as a Separatist headquarters during the Clone Wars, and recently came under Imperial control. Barab (Barab I): Barab I is the homeworld of the reptilian Barabel species. It is currently under Impe­ rial control. Bespin: Bespin is a gas giant and home to the Tibanna gas mining colony of Cloud City. The city fell under Sep­ aratist control during the Clone Wars, but now operates independently. It has popular resorts and casinos. Christophsis: Christophsis is a crystalline planet that is still recovering from its role as a major Clone Wars battleground. Colu (Clak’dor VII): Clak’dor VII is the homeworld of the Bith species. The planet was ecologically destroyed by civil war, forcing the Bith to live within sealed, domed cities. Clak’dor VII was a Separatist world. Dantooine: A world active in the ancient Republic, with the ruins of an ancient Jedi Academy and train­ ing center. More recently, it housed a secret base of the Rebel Alliance, but was evacuated after the dis­ covery of an Imperial tracking device in a shipment. Elrood: Elrood is a major Outer Rim commerce and manufacturing center. Eriadu: Eriadu is the capital world of the Seswenna Sector. It is Grand Moff Tarkin’s homeworld, and his influential family’s traditional power base. Eriadu was loyal to the Republic during the Clone Wars, and an important center of Imperial power in the Outer Rim. Endor: Endor is a virtually unknown, remote system. The Forest (Sanctuary) Moon of the gas giant Endor has been completely isolated by the Empire. Felucia: Felucia is a wild, untamed world filled with dangerous animals and exotic, fungal plants. Felucia was a major battleground during the Clone Wars. Gamorr: Gamorr is the homeworld of the Gamorrean species. The planet is often in a state of war due to the ever-present squabbling between Gamorrean clans. In ancient days, it was also the site of a lesser Sith train­ ing facility. Gand: Gand is the homeworld of the species of the same name. It is ruled by a totalitarian monarchy. Gand settle­ ments are small colonies separated by dense mists. The environmental conditions led to the creation of the Gand Findsmen, who hunted fugitives through the mists. See page 47 for more information on the Gand. Geonosis: Geonosis, homeworld of the insectoid Geonosian species, is a ringed world, located ex­ tremely close to the Tatooine system It served as an early base of operations for the Separatists, and was the site of the first battle of the Clone Wars It houses countless factories beneath its barren surface. Kessel: Kessel is the legendary location of the Kessel Run, a treacherous hyperspace route bounded by a cluster of black holes and used by smugglers to avoid Imperial patrols around the planet itself. The planet is an irregularly shaped rock, only known for glitterstim, which was originally researched for medical uses. Kes­ sel is Imperial controlled, but the illicit trade of glit­ terstim spice still survives. See page 359. Mon Calamari (Mon Cala, Dae): Mon Calamari is the homeworld of both the Mon Calamari and the Quarren species. This water-covered world is currently enslaved by the Empire, but is on the verge of freeing itself. The Mon Calamari live on or near the surface in giant floating cities, while the Quarren come from the ocean’s depths. THE EXPANDING STAR WARS UNIVERSE T he Galaxy chapter covers the broad basics of the galaxy as a whole, at the time of the Empire and from a scoundrel’s point of view. It is meant to introduce new players to the vast, expansive universe from the movies and stories well beyond. It also serves to remind longtime fans where recognizable worlds and regions can be found in the galaxy. At over 30 years old and counting, Star Wars stories new and old continue to be popular. With new novels, graphic novels, fictional ref­ erence books, TV shows, and games releasing every year, no single source can keep up. Fu­ true Star Wars roleplaying game products will, of course, continue to provide more material about many areas. Hopefully, this chapter will inspire game masters and players alike to seek out more information about locations that stir their interest. It’s a big universe. Mandalore: Mandalore is the homeworld of the Mandalorians, an ancient, warrior-based culture. The Mandalorians once ruled large swaths of the galaxy, but currently hold little significant power or influence, aside from their own system and sector. Mustafar: Mustafar is an obscure, volcanic world long mined by the Techno Union. The planet was the final resting place for the Separatist Council after they were killed by Darth Vader. The planet also saw the epic battle between Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi. After the war, the Techno Union was nationalized and Mus­ tafar came under Imperial control. Polis Massa: This system holds the home asteroid field of the Polis Massans. The asteroids were mined via attached habitats and stations. Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa were born there to Queen Amidala, after Obi-Wan Kenobi rescued her from Anakin Sky- walker who had become Darth Vader. Rodia: Rodia is the homeworld of the Rodian species, in the Tyrius system. It is a jungle-covered planet, with huge environmental shields protecting the major cities from their surroundings. Clan politics dominate Rodian life, explosively intermingled with their violent culture. Ryloth: Ryloth is the homeworld of the Twi’lek spe­ cies. The planet is subject to unusual weather and ro­ tational patterns, producing heat storms that warm the world. Most Twi’leks live underground. Socorro: This desert world was originally colonized by Corellian settlers. It is a shadowport with no orga­ nized government, though it has millions of inhabitants. Smugglers and other outlaws thrive on Socorro. It is known for its substantial ship customization services. Sluis Van: Sluis Van is the homeworld of the Sluissi, a species famous for their technical and starship skills. Sluis Van is a major Imperial shipyard, guarded by a series of battle stations. Sullust: Sullust is the difficult homeworld of the Sul- lustan species. The lethal fumes produced by Sullust's volcanos force the Sullustans to live in large, elaborate underground cave cities and systems. The planet is dominated by the SoroSuub Corporation, which re­ cently seized control over the system and declared allegiance to the Empire. Not all Sullustans agree, and some are turning to the Rebel Alliance or their own resistance groups. Taris: Taris is a city-planet important to the ancient Jedi, Sith, and Mandalorian wars. The planet’s influ­ ence and stature has not kept pace through the cen turies. It is now under Imperial control. Tatooine: Tatooine is the homeworld of the Jawas and Sand People (Tusken Raider) species. Tatooine is a desert world that was home to numerous influential figures in the galaxy. It remains under Imperial con­ trol after being wrested from the Hutts after the Clone Wars. Despite this, Jabba the Hutt and his criminal en­ terprise remains a dominant force in planetary affairs. Teth: Located at the current Rimward edge of Hutt Space, Teth was taken from Hutt direct control dur­ ing the Clone Wars. The Republic pushed long estab­ lished criminal activity out of the system, and the Em­ pire made Teth the capital of the Baxel Sector and, nominally, Hutt Space. The Hutts reestablished their influence via other measures, and the Imperial Moff is regarded as corrupt. Telos: Virtually destroyed thousands of years ago by a Sith fleet, Telos was rebuilt via an extensive Repub­ lic environmental restoration effort. The system was part of Separatist space during the Clone Wars, and became a victim of subsequent Imperial atrocities against the civilian population. Utapau: Utapau is the homeworld of two intelligent species, the Pau’ans and the Utai. An isolated world of deep sinkholes interconnected with caves and cav­ erns, Utapau once housed the Separatist Council, until they were forced out by the Republic and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi killed General Grievous. The world remains under Imperial control. Yavin: Yavin is the gas giant for which the moon Yavin 4 is named and orbits. Yavin was the location of the Rebel's secret main base, until it was discovered by the Death Star. Ziost: A central world for the ancient Sith, Ziost was the site of numerous battles and power struggles. Knowl­ edge of the planet faded over the centuries. However, after the Clone Wars, Imperial navigation charts and other references to the system were purged. GRINNER’S OUTER RIM OPPORTUNITIES The Outer Rim is a smuggler's paradise. The sheer number and variety of worlds and species means that somebody somewhere needs something all the time. There is always somewhere you can acquire manufac­ tured goods, and always a place in desperate need of them. To top it off, government and officials are often ineffective, corrupt, or just plain lazy. A lot of places barely even have a government to deal with. Of course, that means you’ll have to rely on yourself and your friends a lot more. You have to be able to repair your ship, fend off pirates, and talk your way out of tight jams with criminals, constables, paramilitary defenders or whatever law might be around. You have to make do with what you have, and know how to scrape together enough credits to get you to the next starport. You just won't believe the number of species you’ll see out in the Outer Rim. I’ll bet that at any given star- port, you’ll only be able to name a quarter of the aliens you see. You'll have to raise your diplomacy and bargaining skills several notches, just to be able to deal with the unusual clientele you’ll run across. You're bound to make cultural mistakes along the way. You'll accidentally insult somebody, or inadvertently cross someone else. It just happens. You’ll have to learn how to talk your way out of it, and when to give up and run. Now, don’t think that just because you’re in the Outer Rim, that the Empire doesn’t exist. It might seem that way sometimes, and it may as well be true in some systems. However, every major system has some kind of Imperial presence, and there are worlds more dedicated to the New Order than you’ll find closer to Coruscant. Sorry, Imperial Center. Old habits die hard. Another tip. You never know when an Imperial ship will show up and ruin your day. You're just as likely to run across a Star Destroyer as a customs vessel out here. Don’t be stupid. Most of the time you are not going to outrun or outgun them. If you’re lucky, you might outsmart them occasionally. Just remember though, you might get away once, but if they get you on file, your chances plummet the next time around. You're going to be boarded in-flight or on the ground, so you better learn how to deal with it. Better to play the part of a good citizen than end up in detention with your ship impounded. Remember, also, the Imperials take their anti-piracy operations very seriously. In fact, pirates are the only thing that gets their attention even more than the Rebels. Don't give them any reason to believe you're either one. I like having you as a client. I need to get these jobs out to someone. Okay, enough rambling advice, let’s see if any of these interest you. The Hutts? Jumping right to the top, huh? Let’s talk about Hutt Space in a few minutes. Outside of there, you could always try to get work out of the infamous Jabba the Hutt on Tatooine. He doesn't like failure, and tends to send trigger-happy bounty hunters after those who disappoint him. You're welcome to try, of course, but I would wait until you have a bit more experience and a lot more of a reputation first. Tatooine isn’t a bad choice though; there is always some scum up to something out there. If nothing else, it’s a good starting point to something bigger and always somewhere better. It might not have the greatest paying gigs or the best clients, but it is busy. Now, Rodia is a decent place to get some experience. The Rodian clans are always looking to gain an ad­ vantage over their enemies and neighbors. The lesser clans smuggle goods into their lands, usually to keep from tipping off the powerhouses that they're up to something. They're used to this sort of operation, so it’s usually very organized. Good secret landing zones, speedy offloading, and even relatively good pay. Of course, once you throw in with one clan, it’s awfully hard to work for any of their enemies without suddenly making a lot of Rodians mad at you on all sides. Think of them as good training for dealing with Hutts, except they're likely to hunt you down themselves if things go wrong. WILD SPACE AND THE UNKNOWN REGIONS W ild Space and the Unknown Regions represent the vast interstellar unknown reaches of galactic space. They are the true frontier. However, just be­ cause they are largely unexplored, that doesn’t mean they are uninhabited. Based on the number of spe­ cies and other civilizations already known through­ out the galaxy, it is a good bet that there are likely millions more. The Unknown Regions alone could be hiding expansive interstellar empires of its own. The term Unknown Regions most often applies to the un­ explored western side of the galaxy, naturally barred from normal hyperspace travel. Wild Space refers to areas that have been at least nominally explored, though it may have been centuries in the past. These areas are usually scattered around the edges of the Outer Rim, but there are also pockets within what is normally regarded as Known Space. W ILD SPACE Wild Space has long been the term for minimally ex­ plored areas at the fringes of Known Space. Due to continuous efforts to explore and colonize system af­ ter system, Wild Space is the ever-changing edge of the map. Wild Space represents great opportunities to independent, corporate, and government scouts. Discovering a new civilization to trade with, or a new world rich in precious metals and ore, can make the discoverer famous. While the scouts might get a sub­ stantial bonus for a great find, the real credits are to be made by the traders and developers to follow. Wild Space is dangerous. Just getting into Wild Space can be tricky due to nonexistent or outdated astrogation data. Initial contact with a new species rarely goes smoothly, and most scouts aren’t fully equipped diplomatically or officially to deal with the situation. Plenty of these worlds may be registered as uninhabited or unknown, but scouts never know when a lost colony, smuggler’s den, or underworld base might suddenly appear. Such settlements are rarely happy to be discovered. During the Clone Wars, Wild Space made for conve­ nient hiding places and staging areas for the Separatists. With their ties to megacorporations and the various in­ dustrial and mining guilds, they had a wealth of propri­ etary scouting information unavailable to the Republic. Both during the war and in the dark times afterwards, desperate refugees sometimes fled into Wild Space. Initially, the Empire pursued the Separatist refugees and performed reconnaissance in force to eliminate some of the larger hideouts and settlements. Now that the Empire’s military and bureaucratic control over the galaxy has stabilized, it organizes official ex­ ploration missions deep into Wild Space. THE UNKNOW N REGIONS Historically, Unknown Regions is the term for unex­ plored space beyond the known worlds. As such, this area continually shrunk in size as civilization, and the Republic in particular, expanded through the ages. The Unknown Regions remain the source of outra­ geous tales and sinister threats. Galactic civilization views the area as a combination of romantic frontier and a source of unexpected horror. It is a place that has produced new threats and reinvigorated old en­ emies for millennia. Before the establishment of the Republic, in the earliest days of Coruscant, the Raka- ta Infinite Empire ruled important worlds across the galaxy, from their home world deep in the modern day Unknown Regions. During the time of the Old Republic, Sith and Mandalorian foes long thought destroyed would periodically reemerge and wreak havoc on the galaxy. The modern day boundaries of the Unknown Re­ gions were established with the discovery of a great tangle of hyperspace anomalies, forming a barrier that splits the galaxy virtually in two. The tangle makes hyperspace travel extremely difficult or im­ possible. Though its origins are debatable, it has been a natural obstacle to galactic exploration and development for millennia. Survey missions and other efforts to find reliable routes are at best slow and dangerous. However, passage is not completely impossible. The Republic sent a well-supported, long-term expedition in the form of the Outbound Flight project. Like the majority of such efforts, it ended in disappearance and disaster. Travelers also occasionally arrive from the other side, though their appearance is often vio­ lent and aggressive. During the Clone Wars, official exploration efforts largely ceased, with Republic scouts distracted by the war. Government-sponsored exploration began anew with the Empire, in an effort to expand Imperial space, exploit new resources or worlds, and search for any sign of rebel activity. Rebel efforts to use the Unknown Regions as a base of operations are mini­ mal, due to the resources and time needed to find suitable locations. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Un­ known Regions and Wild Space, at or before the rise of the Empire. Hum: Located in the Unknown Regions in the north­ west quadrant of the galaxy, Hum is a world origi­ nally held secret by the Jedi. Under the mountains of this icy world lie caves holding Hum crystals. Jedi used these crystals in their lightsabers, usually giving them a blue or green color. The world is now moni­ tored by Imperial droids, who keep a watchful eye for any surviving Jedi or other Force users returning for the crystals. Kamino: The homeworld of the Kaminoans, this was the source of the Republic's Clone armies during the Clone Wars. The water-covered world is still under strict Imperial control. Kamino is an extra-galactic system. It is located in an area of Wild Space beyond the Outer Rim, in a dwarf satellite galaxy near the Rishi Maze. Unknown World (Rakata Prime, Lehon): This home- world of the Rakata species was the center of the an­ cient Infinite Empire, which once spanned the galaxy. Now, however, the planet is long abandoned, save for the relics and ruins that dot the beaches and oceans of its surface. HUTT SPACE A mong the oldest civilizations in the galaxy are the Hutts. Controlling a large region of space along the Mid Rim and Outer Rim border in the Slice, the Hutts have been a fixture of galactic politics, criminality, and gamesmanship for thousands of years. The borders of Hutt Space fluctuated greatly over the centuries, ex­ panding and contracting in accordance with the bal­ ance of power between the Hutts and the surrounding governments. After a brief expansion of territory before and during the Clone Wars, the Hutts lost control of many Coreward sectors and systems in the Mid Rim, as well as some trailing sectors in the Outer Rim. The ma­ jority of official Hutt Space currently rests in the Outer Rim within the Slice, though their influence extends to sectors, systems, and governments far beyond. The Hutts were among the earliest interstellar ex­ plorers and colonists in the galaxy. Expanding out­ wards from their homeworld of Varl, their colonies thrived thanks to their own cunning, determination, and the enslavement of species they discovered in their path. Their first encounters with humans were in the ancient Tion Cluster, and their first suitable rival was Xim the Despot. The Hutts soon had their own problems, in the form of a civil war. Their homeworld and many colo­ nies were utterly destroyed. The survivors moved to Evocar, renamed it Nal Hutta, and established the Council of Elders to lim it future conflicts. A f­ terwards, the Hutts sought power and influence through means other than strictly m ilitary mea­ sures. Through the centuries, the Hutts would in­ fluence corporations, governments, and criminal empires throughout the Republic. GRINNER’S WILD IDEAS Now, you must be crazy if you’re talking to me about Wild Space and the Unknown Regions. You know the difference, right? Wild Space refers to known but lightly explored regions within the galaxy proper, especially at the edges of the spiral arms. The Unknown Regions are just a blank space. People mix them all the time, but they're not the same. Sections of Wild Space can be found most anywhere in the galaxy, but most of the time, people mean those areas at the periphery of the Outer Rim and elsewhere. Every so often, someone, maybe a govern­ meant or large corporation, will send an expedition into one of those zones. Once in a while it’s a group of dedicated colonists. The Unknown Regions is a different animal entirely. There’s a reason galactic civilization has developed on one side of the galaxy for millennia. It’s called the hyperspace tangle. You see, while everyone’s looked for centuries for a usable hyperlane like the Hydian Way, it just doesnt seem to exist on the western side of the disk. The main reason is that hyperspace seems to be tied in knots, forming a nearly impassible barrier between Known Space and the Unknown Regions. Even when someone finds a route through the tangle, it doesn’t stay stable for long. If you're going to the Unknown Regions, you'll need the best astrogator and the best astrogation equip­ meant you can buy. Are you a trained scout? If not, you better hire someone. Everything I said about fending for yourself in the Outer Rim goes triple in the Unknown Regions. If you can find your way in, there s little telling what you’ll discover. As to what you’ll find beyond the barrier, that’s anyone’s guess. You heard the legends and stories as much as I have. Ancient Sith strongholds? Maybe. Force-using pirates? Sure, why not. Planet sized fac­ tories spewing ready-made starfighters and battle cruisers? Well, if you find that one, I'll help you start a bidding war between the Rebels, the Empire, and the Hutts. Some say you can even find the legendary home world of the ancient Infinite Empire. Now, I’ve known a few foolhardy souls who’ve tried their luck at the Unknown Regions. You know how many came back? Two, and that’s because they were lucky enough to survive a hyperspace mishap while trying to penetrate the barrier. I don't know what happened to the rest. Maybe they died in the attempt, found something carnivorous on the other side, or found something they liked better than being in civilized space. For all I know, they might come walking through that door in the next five minutes, but I wouldn't bet on it. GRIIMNER’S HUTT CONNECTIONS Hutts and smugglers, they’re just a natural pair­ ing, aren’t they? Working for the Hutts is lucrative but dangerous. The more you work for one Hutt, the more entrenched you become in his business. That might mean more credits, and maybe ris­ ing up some sort of power structure, but a Hutt will expect loyalty in return. Freelancing for other Hutts and especially hated rivals are a good way to find a big bounty on your head. If you are un­ comfortable with that notion, don’t work for them. Now, just about every kind of smuggling operation can be had, if you can find the right Hutt. Spice, weapons, contraband, stolen starships— anything you like. If you’re a specialist, if you're really good, and you stay bought, you'll find your reputation and pay rise quickly. Hutt Space is certainly their center of power. You’ll find their fingerprints on operations all over the Outer Rim. However, their reach goes far beyond their home sectors. With the right connections, they can influence most any corporation or govern­ meant across the galaxy. How much pressure they can exert varies greatly, of course, but if the Hutt in question doesn't have a direct connection, I’m sure he can find one quickly. Jobs in Hutt Space are pretty easy to come by. Keeping yourselves from drowning in intrigue is the real trick. I’ve got a few pointers for you. One, stay away from jobs dealing with the Boonta area. You’re not likely to be offered any from the Hutts, unless you’re a Hutt yourself, so that's not the issue. No, sometimes other interests will at­ tempt to hire smugglers to penetrate the area. If you’re caught, you’re likely to end up in the slave pits, if you live. If you succeed, and word gets out, even escaping to the Unknown Regions won’t stop their bounty hunters. If you’re looking to avoid working directly for the Hutts, go ahead and make a trip to Nar Shaddaa. There are plenty of other galactic interests in play there. Other good meeting places are Kwenn Space Station and Sriluur. Lots of interstellar traffic makes for a lot of intersecting interests. HUTT MANIPULATION The Hutts made treaties with the Republic establish­ ing boundaries at the Coreward edge of the galaxy. As Hutt Space does not intersect with any of the great hyperroutes, they created many within their own re­ gion. The Hutts also established secret routes into the Republic. They have never truly recovered from the loss of their one-time Republic trade route to Nal Hutta and its moon Nar Shaddaa. A supernova and its effects made the route impassible. In the years before the Clone Wars, Hutt influence extended into traditional Republic and neutral ter­ ritory. The Hutts took full advantage of Republic corruption and conflicts between the Separatist systems to gain economic and territorial ground, especially in the Expansion Region, Mid, and Outer Rim. Their Outer Rim expansion reached the sys­ tems along the Corellian Run, including Tatooine and Ryloth. Hutt Space contracted greatly as the Empire ex­ erted renewed political and m ilitary power over the traditionally Republic sectors. Nominally, the Hutts are Imperial subjects, with Hutt Space under Impe­ rial control and ruled from the Rimward Teth system. In reality, the Hutts largely govern their own affairs and their worlds, and the Empire allows them to do so. While there are occasional shows of force, or pro­ tracted political battles, they are often merely po­ litical theater. As long as the Hutts continue to be a source of lucrative tax income, and they do not support the Rebel Alliance within their borders, the Empire tolerates their semi-autonomous status. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within Hutt Space, at or before the rise of the Empire. Boonta: Boonta is a region of closely located inhab­ ited systems in the center of Hutt Space, protected by otherwise rarely seen Hutt warships. It is closed to most outsiders. Cyax: Cyax is a star system considered taboo and sa­ cred by the Hutts. They do not speak of it, and keep its location off of their official star charts. Klatooine: Klatooine is the homeworld of the Klatoo- inian species. It was conquered by the Hutts prior to the establishment of the Republic. Kleeva (Boonda’s Moon): Boonda’s Moon orbits the gas giant Kleeva, and houses a droid factory that serves as one of the Hutts’ best-recognized legiti­ mate businesses. Kwenn Space Station: Kwenn is a large space sta­ tion at the current Coreward edge of Hutt Space in the slice, known for the Royal K Casino. It is visited by travelers and Imperial military vessels alike, and is the entry system to the Ootmian Pabol hyperlane. Nal Hutta: Once called Evocar, Nal Hutta became the Hutt's adopted home world at the expense of the native Evocii species. The Hutt Grand Council meets here. See page 360 for more information. N ar Shaddaa: Called the Smuggler’s Moon, Nal Hutta's city-moon is infamous for its lax laws and impressive criminal connections. See page 360 for more information. Ootmian Pabol: Ootmian Pabol is a major Hutt Space hyperlane, connecting Nal Hutta to Kwenn and into the Empire and Inner Rim via Ubrikkia. Pabol Hutta: Pabol Hutta is a major Hutt Space hy­ perlane, connecting Nal Hutta, Varl, and Sleheyron to the periphery region at the current northernmost point of Hutt Space. Shag Pabol: This is a major Hutt Space hyperlane, connecting Nal Hutta and Ylesia to the Outer Rim world of Teth, Rimward of Hutt Space. Sleheyron: Sleheyron is one of the most powerful trade worlds in Hutt Space, deeply entrenched in Hutt intrigue and politics, and able to exert extensive eco­ nomic power. Sriluur: Sriluur is the homeworld of the Weequay, and is currently under Imperial control. Regardless, the planet remains a favorite meeting place for smugglers and others with business in the area. Toydaria: This is the homeworld of the Toydarians, long time servants of the Hutts. Toydaria exports foodstuffs and provides recreational activities and re­ sorts for the Hutts. Ylesia: Ylesia holds glitterstim spice mining and pro­ cessing operations, which uses slave labor. Varl: Varl is the original Hutt homeworld. It remains sacred to them, though its surface was essentially de­ stroyed in an ancient civil war. It is well protected from outsiders. THE CORPORATE SECTOR T he Corporate Sector lies on the outer edge of the Outer Rim Territories. The northeastern end of the Hydian Way ends at the major industrial port world of Bonadan, after passing through the heart of Corporate Sector space. The sector is bounded by Wild Space on its western edge. Politically, it is the result of experi­ ments with total corporate control of a major region of space. The sector is administered by the Corporate Sector Authority, controlled by companies participat­ ing in the conglomerate. Though the area administered has changed over its history, the CSA currently oversees about 30,000 worlds divided into twenty-nine territo­ ries. The CSA controls everything about the sector, serv­ ing as government, security, and the sole employer. The Corporate Sector was home to human and oth­ er colonies since before the formation of the Repub­ lic. Though accessible at an early stage of Republic exploration, the region’s remote location hampered development. The extension of the Hydian Way into the area improved trade and communications with the galaxy’s core, but it did not attract attention like the inner regions. Most major galactic events, wars, and invasions failed to reach much more than the out­ skirts of the modern Corporate Sector boundaries. The original experiments in corporate-controlled space failed in areas of what became the Expansion Region (see page 339). When the corporations tried again, years later, they negotiated a deal to take over several hundred systems, far out in the Outer Rim. While the Republic initially provided security and safeguards for workers, it was not long until the cor­ porations obtained practical control of the sector. CORPORATE CONTROL Over the years, the Corporate Sector developed at a moderate rate, but never truly met corporate expecta­ tions. Member companies presented various solutions to this problem to the Senate, which usually included expansion proposals. As economic and political con­ ditions within the Republic worsened, most member companies joined the Separatists when the Clone Wars erupted. Loyalist companies were pushed out. After the war, however, the loyalist companies grasped the opportunity they had received for backing the vic­ tors. During the rise of the Empire, the young industri­ alist Baron Orman Tagge approached Emperor Palpa- tine with a proposal. If the Empire dissolved the traitor megacorporations and gave their assets to loyal corpo­ rate entities, as well as dramatically expanding the size of the Corporate Sector and giving it autonomy within its borders, the new CSA would provide the Empire with a massive annual tithe of profits and materials. The new Corporate Sector was an instant success— at least for the megacorporations who owned a stake in it. The CSA could use and exploit the resources of tens of thousands of star systems, and soon con­ trolled vast amounts of wealth. Under CSA guidance, opportunities within the sector expanded greatly and large numbers of workers moved into the region, hop­ ing to share in the profits. However, they quickly learned the realities of living under a corporate master. The CSA controls virtually everything, including paychecks, the cost of goods and services, and access to anything they need or want. Even the small independent companies and merchants allowed to operate feel the heavy hand of the CSA in their dealings. The corporate sponsors’ drive for profits controls everything else. Abuses of power, while more subdued than in earlier eras, have returned nevertheless. Conditions are poor and often hazardous, meeting the barest minimum needed to keep operations running at minimal cost. One of the worst crimes in the Corporate Sector is conspiring to form a union. NOTABLE LOCATIONS The following are areas of interest within the Corpo­ rate Sector, at or before the rise of the Empire. Bonadan: Bonadan is a heavily populated industrial world, central to Corporate Sector travel and distri­ bution services. Environmental conditions are dismal, with overwhelming pollution. Security is tight. Weap­ owns are prohibited, and automated scanners con­ stantly enforce this policy. Craci: Craci is the origin world of the popular Cracian Thumper, used as steeds by scouts and others. Agri­ culture and industry across the five worlds powers its enormously active starports. Davirien: Davirien is a research jungle world owned by a single corporation, Chiewab Amalgamated Phar­ maceuticals. Imperial training operations are allowed on Davirien, which is highly unusual within Corporate Sector borders. Etti: Etti IV is a favored planet of the CSA’s wealthier executives, with resorts, estates and leisure attrac­ tions. The native sentient species, the Etti, were relo­ cated to Etti V, which is off limits to outsiders. Farana: Farana is the homeworld of the Ocsin, which are near-human merchants and explorers. Farana is also the name of a region of Wild Space to the west of the Corporate Sector. Part of tra ­ ditional Farana Space now lies within the Corpo­ rate Sector, thanks to the annexation of the Ocsin colony (see below). Farana and most of its nearby colony systems have never been part of the Re­ public or Empire. Kalla: Kalla is home of the University of Kalla, the Corporate Sector's premier educational institution. The Empire maintains an observation post and base in system. Lythos: Lythos is a heavily exploited system of four­ teen worlds. It is a center of agriculture and mining. Maryo: Maryo is an oceanic world, well known in the Corporate Sector for its wild and varied markets. It is a favorite destination for the extremely wealthy. Mytus: Mytus holds Stars’ End, a highly secure prison facility controlled by the CSA, for profit. Mytus is actu­ ally located in Wild Space and kept separate from the Corporate Sector for political reasons, as well as truth­ ful denials about its existence in Imoerial or CSA soace. Tiran: Tiran is the capital world of Tirani Space, a small area adjacent to the Corporate Sector. The Ti­ rani have rebuffed recent CSA offers of annexation, leading to armed conflicts and outright invasion and seizure of some worlds by the CSA. GRINNER’S CORPORATE CONNECTIONS^ The Corporate Sector? The first thing you have to realize with the Corporate Sector is that de­ spite the stories, the Corporate Sector Author­ ity doesn’t actually own and operate every single business and operation. Just almost all of it. There are plenty of small-time independent oper­ ators and lesser corporations doing business ev­ ery day out there. It’s just a lot harder for them. They're often subject to seemingly random fees, taxes, and whatever else the CSA can dream up to drain a few more credits out of them. The funny thing about the Corporate Sector is how insulated it is from the galaxy. Sure, they get ga­ lactic news and are subject to Imperial decrees, but their local problems and CSA regulations make it feel like an entirely separate entity. Aside from whatever they can sell to the rest of the gal­ axy, they are simply too caught up in their own affairs to worry too much about galactic issues. Now, the smuggling opportunities are similar to other areas of the galaxy with restricted goods. However, your best bet here is to get some reliable info on whatever gadget, food­ stuff, drink, entertainment, or object can't be found at a decent price out there. Despite the Espos’ best efforts, there's still a thriving black market for people looking to avoid the steep company prices on everything. There are also occasional opportunities to work for the CSA directly. I would avoid those. They won’t be fair, and you'll soon find you run up some kind of unexpected debt or penalty difficult to pay off or avoid. It's a bit like working for the underworld, in that respect. STARS' END A formerly highly secret prison facility located in the Mytus system of the Corporate Sector, Stars' End serves as a destination for hardened criminals, political prisoners, and anyone who sufficiently angers the Corporate Sector Au­ thority. The prison is a massive tower holding thousands of stasis booths—prisoners' cells, keeping them silent and frozen in time, a handy way to prevent riots and escape attempts. In addition, Stars’ End possesses formidable de­ fenses ranging from turbolaser batteries to an on-station Marauder-class corvette. One successful escape from Stars' End oc­ curred in 2 BBY, when the smuggler Han Solo organized a rescue of his partner, the Wookiee Chewbacca, as well as several more unjustly im­ prisoned citizens. The escape nearly destroyed the entire complex. Stars' End has since been repaired and rebuilt, although greatly lacking one of its greatest shields—secrecy. Ocsin: Ocsin is actually a colony of the Ocsin. The CSA recently annexed the system into the Corporate Sector, offering technological help in exchange for the rich Wild Space navigational data Ocsin scouts have compiled. Reltooine: Reltooine is the first Corporate Sector system on the Hydian Way. It is mainly a tourist at­ traction, thanks to the gas giant’s spectacular rings and moons. Saclas: Saclas is a rough-and-tumble Ocsin colony. It is a favorite meeting place for merchants and smug­ glers who want to avoid too much CSA contact. OTHER NOTABLE LOCATIONS n ot all galactic geographic areas are classified by planet, system, sector, or major region. Some titles are informal spacer slang for a hyperroute or collection of stars. Others are holdovers from past in­ terstellar empires or long-held cultural connections. As the Republic expanded and encountered existing interstellar political bodies, it often granted them Al­ lied Region status. Most eventually joined or were otherwise incorporated into the Republic as sectors. However, a few Allied Regions remain, though most travelers would regard them as still part of Republic or Imperial space. Some Allied Regions and other bodies still retain significant political power. A very few are fully autonomous, even under the Empire. BOTHAN SPACE Bothan Space is an Allied Region in the Mid Rim of over 150 inhabited systems of mainly Bothan colo­ nies. It is ruled by the Bothan Council and Bothan clans. Bothan Space remains an Allied Region under the Empire, but it is closely monitored and still subject to Imperial decree. THE CENTRALITY The Centrality is a small, remote, semi-autonomous region nominally under Imperial control. The region has little to offer the galaxy at large, and the Empire recently installed a puppet government to oversee the region. The Hutts also have no interest in direct rule, but have heavily influenced the Centrality for thousands of years. They continue to do so, even under the Empire. The Centrality is located at the far reaches of the Outer Rim, beyond Hutt Space and adjoining Wild Space at the edge of the galaxy. The Cand homeworld is also nearby. The Cadma Conduit hyperroute con­ nects the main Centrality systems to the more main­ line hyperlanes that eventually connect to the Perle- mian Trade Route and Hutt Space. Merchants and travelers are typically interested in Oseon for its asteroid-based casinos, and a small ring of nearby star systems. Among them is Rafa, home- world of the ancient Sharu. Towards the far end of the Centrality lies the hidden world of Tund, home of the mysterious Sorcerers of Tund. HAPES CLUSTER The Hapes Cluster is home to the isolationist Hapes Consortium, an Allied Region of the Republic and the Empire. Hapes’ division from the rest of the galaxy is partially physical. The cluster is surrounded by a natural feature called the Transitory Mists, which in­ terferes with hyperspace travel. Only a few stable routes link the cluster to the outside galaxy, and they are heavily guarded. The Hapes Consortium is a matriarchal society domi­ nated by royalty, etiquette, constant political intrigue, and assassinations. Their continual internal maneuver­ ing and gamesmanship focuses their attention on their own affairs. The Republic was happy to leave the Con­ sortium alone. It appears the Empire is following suit. HERGLIC SPACE The Herglics established their own Empire well before the rise of the Old Republic. The Herglics empire failed long before they allied with the Republic. The Empire seized control of Herglic industry, and now mercilessly rules the Herglics. Herglic Space is still considered an Allied Region. It includes about forty systems, mainly near the Rimma Trade Route. MANDALORIAN SPACE As the home region of the fearsome Mandalorian war­ riors, and their homeworld of Mandalore, the extents of Mandalorian Space have expanded and shrunk along with their fortunes. At the height of the ancient Mandal­ orian Wars, Mandalorian Space stretched from the edge of the Inner Rim to the northeastern edge of the Outer Rim. While other systems and areas Coreward were also conquered, they were occupied Republic worlds. Even in modern times, this vast area is among the least populated in the galaxy. By the time of the Clone Wars and rise of the Empire, Mandalorian Space large­ ly meant the Mandalore Sector. Thought nominally loyal to the Republic, factions within the Mandalorian ranks fought for cultural and political dominance. By the time of the Empire, few publicly follow the old ways. Boba Fett is the best known representative of this ancient warrior culture. SHADOWPORTS Shadowports typically operate without regard to any type of government regulation. Many rely on hidden, remote, or mobile locations, while others buy off law enforcement. Some ports are simply too big and busy to be adequately policed, sustaining an ongoing mix of legal and illegal activity, even in Imperial or other­ wise regulated space. Shadowports may be found in every region of the galaxy, though many are in the Outer Rim Territories. Shadowport juggernauts Nar Shaddaa and Kwenn Space Station are favorite destinations in Hutt Space. Tatooine, Terminus, Bespin, and Socorro are a few of the better known ports in the Outer Rim. Even the Core Worlds are not immune, with the once reliable Abrega- do-rae sliding into the realm of shadowy dealings. In truth, no one knows how many shadowports exist, as most rely on some form of secrecy for their continued operation. While the mega shadowports benefit from their notoriety, there are far more, smaller ports known only to their local patrons, smugglers, and criminals. While major shadowports host a vast array of illegal activities and contraband, smaller ports tend to spe­ cialize in local needs. At a minimum, they are excellent meeting places for those who wish to avoid regulatory complications. Most rely on smuggling in some form, as enabler and purchaser. Some shadowports include star- ship repair and upgrade services, useful for those requir­ ing clandestine repairs or illegal upgrades to their ships. Though relatively safe from government agents, shadow- ports are highly dangerous. Owners and operators are al­ ways on guard, protecting the operation from agents and rivals. Large criminal enterprises run many shadowports, posing a danger to any who challenge their control, or simply disposing of anyone they feel is a threat. THE SLICE The Slice is the vast, wedge-shaped region of the galaxy between the Perlemian Trade Route and the Corellian Run. Like regions, the Slice is largely a geo­ graphic designation and not a political division. No one controls the Slice. The Slice extends from the Core Worlds all the way to the edge of the galaxy, and was the heart of galactic exploration and development for millennia. Almost every usable world has been mapped and explored from the Expansion to the Core Worlds. Beyond the Expansion Region, the volatility of Hutt Space and the vastness of the Outer Rim means that there are still worlds to be dis­ covered, developed, and exploited. Galactic exploration flowed along the Perlemian and the Corellian Run, and turned towards the inner reaches of the Slice. Aside from the Outer Rim and portions of the Expansion Region, a large network of hyperroutes ties the region together. TION CLUSTER The Tion Cluster lies on the Perlemian Trade Route in the Outer Rim. It formed an early connection with the Republic that helped spur development of the Perle­ mian much farther into the galaxy than any other early hyperroute. Home to one of the most ancient Human societies, it was first colonized by sleeper ships from Coruscant. Given the difficulties of hyperspace travel at that time, the region became isolated and their origins forgotten. They developed their own hyperdrive sys­ tem, based on a "lighthouse network’’ of beacons. The society produced the legendary Xim the Despot, who eventually fell in battle with the Hutts. The Tionese also fought with Coruscant, with battles and skirmishes all along the Perlemian Trade Route. The Hutts eventually intervened, attacking the Tionese with such ferocity that they sought protection from the Core Worlds. Within the cluster lies the Tion Hegemony, a group of twenty-seven systems remote and uninteresting enough to avoid direct Imperial control. As such, it supports a va­ riety of illegal and semi-legal operations. It is a favorite, if distant, home for smugglers and criminals. BESPIN Astronavigation Data: Bespin sys­ tem, Anoat Sector, Outer Rim region Orbital Metrics: 5,110 days per year / 1 2 hours per day Government: guild Population: 6 million (Humans 68%, Ugnaughts 8%, Lutrillians 6%, other 18%) Languages: Basic Terrain: gas clouds M ajor Cities: Cloud City (capital), Tibannopolis (semi-abandoned), Ug- naught Surface Areas of Interest: Life Zone Major Exports: Tourism, Tibanna gas, cloud cars M ajor Imports: consumables, industrial goods Trade Routes: Corellian Trade Spine, Corellian Run Special Conditions: Type I atmosphere (breathable) only in band of the Life Zone Background: In a universe full of rarities, Bespin still manages to stand apart. With no livable surface area, gas giants are rarely worth colonizing, Bespin, how­ ever, contains a resource so valuable it makes any ex­ pense in colonization viable: Tibanna gas. Tibanna gas serves several purposes in galactic technology. One refined version is a potent hyperdrive coolant, while another version can be used with weaponry. Blaster packs are filled with compressed gases which, when excited, emit a bolt of searing energy. Of the half-dozen gases available on the market, spin-' sealed Tibanna gas is one of the most powerful (and expensive), as it quadruples energy output of a blaster pack. Safest when used in heavy weapons, spin-sealed Tibanna gas still finds its way into personal weaponry. This fortune in Bespin’s clouds led to a host of re- pulsorlift cities inhabiting the “Life Zone,” a band of breathable atmosphere 50 kilometers deep. The zone is also home to immense, beldons which graze on clouds of phosphorescent algae, packs of velkers which prey on the beldons, and rawwk bats which scavenge on anything that remains. Bespin’s capital, Cloud City, was constructed by the entrepreneur Ecclessis Figg, who planned to conceal his illegal mining operations of Tibanna for blaster weap­ owns with a veneer of legitimate business. To this end he touted his city as a luxury resort and coolant mining operation. Years later, under control of Baron Adminis­ trator Lando Calrissian, the “cover" has become reality; tourism is one of Cloud City's major industries. Under Calrissian's rule, Cloud City has risen in prosperity to remain as Bespin’s undisputed capital. Although Cloud City is Bespin’s largest city, there are communities making credits mining Tibanna gas. The largest, Tibannopolis has seen a reversal in mining for­ tunes in the last decades. Now, mostly abandoned, it drifts aimlessly. One of the other floating communities of note is the so-called “Ugnaught Surface,” a floating platform whose surface is landscaped to mimic the sur­ face of the Ugnaughts’ homeworld of Gentes. CLOUD CITY D esigned by an Alderaanian architect, Cloud City conceals its mining infrastructure with an airy elegance that matches the surrounding at­ mosphere. For many, there is no more romantic getaway than a week in the clouds. The top fifty levels of the city house resorts, spas, casinos, shopping centers, theaters, chapels—anything that pleases the heart and relaxes the mind. The city’s mid-section consists of the facilities for Be­ spin Motors, and also Port Town, where the locals work and live. At the bottom levels near the main repulsor shaft, a dedicated workforce of humans, Ugnaughts. and Lutrillians fly out in trawlers to scoop Tibanna from the atmosphere, then return to package the mined gas for export. CORELLIA Astronavigation Data: Corellian system, Corellian Sector, Core region Orbital Metrics: 329 days per year / 25 hours per day Government: republic Population: 3 billion (Humans 60%, Drall 20%, Selonians 20%) Languages: Basic Terrain: forests, hills, plains M ajor Cities: Coronet (capital), Kor Vella, Tyrena Areas of Interest: Treasure Ship Row, Corona House, The Cold Beaches, Selonian tunnels M ajor Exports: starships, alcohol, consumables M ajor Imports: weaponry, raw materials, luxury goods Trade Routes: Corellian Trade Spine, Corellian Run Special Conditions: none Background: When it comes to starships, buyers can rely on three rules: if you want quality, trust the starshipwrights of Fondor; if you want to impress, buy Kuati; if you need speed, go Corellian. Thrust, accel­ eration, and hyperspace velocity are the major design concerns of any Corellian shipbuilder, from the mom- and-pop outfits who customize light freighters, to the galactic renowned Corellian Engineering Corporation. Speed is not just a feature of Corellian engines, it’s also in every Corellian's genes. They are people who are always on the move; whether it be jetting off to a remote star system without warning or letting their wee ones take joyrides on swoops, Corellians are renowned throughout the galaxy as having "rocket fuel for blood.” However, theirs is a restlessness without malice; a Corel­ lian's heart is his true engine, passion his accelerant. This propensity to act before thinking has jump-started the career of billions of Corellian smugglers and scouts, EARNING YOUR BLGODSTRIPES T he most prestigious of Corellia's national prizes are "bloodstripes,” yellow or red piping stitched down the trouser legs. Corellia’s govern­ meant and military award them for heroic displays of bravery, done with the knowledge that such action requires great sacrifice. For a people who prefer to shoot first and ask questions later, mo­ ments of deliberation are valued highly. and has also made many Corellians such as Solo and Antilles household names. Some popular sociologists claim that Corellian bold­ ness stems from their origins as an orphan race of hu­ mans, since no archaeological trace of a pre-industrial, primitive culture has been found on the planet. That, plus the fact that Corellia’s system sports five habitable planets (Corellia, Drall, Selonia, Talus, and Tr'alus), and an ancient, massive space station called Centerpoint, lends an air of mystery and romance to Corellia. With its history of starhoppers, spaceship engineers, and two-bit smugglers, one may expect that .the planet Corellia is itself a junkyard of burnt-out engines and non-recyclable conduit housing. This could not be fur­ ther from the truth. Corellia is a lush world of forests and farmlands, ice-capped mountains and golden beaches. Its capital, Coronet, is a bustling, lively city, with all the amenities of any metropolis in the galaxy and the kinds of bars and brothels you can find on Nar Shaddaa. Corellians love to mix their spiced ale with a good fist- fight, then go home to sleep it off in a comfortable bed, so as to be ready for another round the next day. Corellia's independence was at a nadir when the Republic fell. Palpatine had no patience for Corellian intransigence and swiftly turned the system's ruler, the Diktat, into a puppet of an Imperial Moff. Unlike Fondor, however, the Empire has not been able to completely nationalize Corellia's shipyards and engi­ neering corps. FONDOR Astronavigation Data: Fon dor system, Tapani Sector, Colonies region • Orbital Metrics: 41 2 days per y e a r /31 hours per day Government: guild Population: 5 billion (Humans 75%, Herglic 11 %, Mrlssi 7%, Sullustan 3%, other 4%) Languages: Basic Terrain: industrial urban Major Cities: Fondor City (capital) Areas of Interest: orbital shipyards, underground steam tunnels, cities M ajor Exports: starships, technol­ ogy, droids M ajor Imports: consumables, luxury goods, mechanicals, droids Trade Routes: Rimma Trade Route, secret hy­ perspace route to Gandeal in Core Special Conditions: none Background: Ranked third behind Corellia and Kuat in starship construction, Fondor has staked its reputa­ tion not in mass production, but in quality. Many of the best-designed frigates and capital ships are built in its shipyards, from the Super Star Destroyer Execu­ tor to Hutt yachts. The Fondor Starshipwrights Guild guarantees this caliber of quality by exercising control over every step that goes into starship construction,, from blueprint designs and mechanical implementa­ tion to planetary governance and even the micro- management of workers’ daily lives. Millennia of starship construction have taken their toll on Fondor. Navigating leftover debris or the star- ship girders that ring the planet is a nightmare. Most freighters dock at orbiting stations, with passengers conveyed by shuttle through the safest corridors to the planet. Newcomers often gasp at the effect min­ ing and industrialization has had on the surface. Virtu­ ally all of Fondor is covered with factories, exhaust stacks, administration complexes, and metal refiner­ ies. Its underground is no different, a hollowed-out hive of access tunnels and steam vents. The guild is quite aware that their hard-working members need a release for stress, and consequently has turned Fondor's capital into the perfect retreat for well-intentioned debauchery. Just about every vice is offered in some form or another, in compliance with guild regulations, of course. Workers understand that too much indulgence can lead to termination, though often it does not go that far, since the guild keeps an eye on its employees at all times. The guild relies on droids to keep its sentient work­ force's size manageable. Self-service units accomplish the most menial tasks, while giant droid brains co­ ordinate production cycles, workers' schedules, and large-scale projects to achieve maximum efficiency. This dependence on mechanical labor has given birth to Fondor’s second industry: droid design and manu­ facture. Fondor turns out some of the most capable labor droids in the galaxy. In the last few decades. Fondor's shipyards have been nationalized by the Empire. This, plus draconian security measures during the construction of the Ex­ ecutor, turned Fondor into an Imperial military enclave. MOON OF NALLASTIA C enturies ago, a group of Fondorians broke away from the guild to protect the jungle moon of Nallastia from exploitation. Sympa­ thetic Mon Calamari and Ithorians in the Re­ public Senate rallied behind the Nallastian movement to recognize its independence, much to the guild’s ire. Now Fondor's moon revolves around the planet like a tempting jewel, and is whispered to be a shelter for the Rebel Alliance. KESSEL Astronavigation Data: Kessa system, Kessel Sector, Outer Rim region Orbital Metrics: 322 days per year / 26 hours per day Government: military prison Population: 700-1,000 (military and administrative), prisoner number varies in the thousands Languages: Basic Terrain: alkali flats, mountains, caves M ajor Cities: Kessendra (a small military town) Areas of Interest: Imperial prison facilities, spice mines Major Exports: glitterstim spice Major Imports: consumables, technology Trade Routes: Pabol Sleheyron, Kessel Trade Corridor Special Conditions: Type III atmosphere (breath mask .required), radiation suit for prolonged surface excursions Background: Twenty-five thousand years before the brutal conquests of Emperor Palpatine, the planet known as “Xo’s Eye" bore witness to battles between Xim the Despot and the Hutt empire. Though the name never stuck, the misshapen planet later known as Kessel became known across the galaxy for the treasure buried beneath its rocky surface: glitterstim spice, which would soon become one of the most sought-after stimulants in the galaxy. For countless years, freighter captains with delusions of grandeur hazarded expeditions into this remote pocket of space. However, the route to Kessel was treacherous, plagued by nebulas, asteroids, and a clus­ ter of black holes of immense size: the Maw. Few ever returned from these runs, and the ones who did and GLITTERSTIM SPICE M ore potent than Rytholian ryll, glitterstim is also much more addictive and, thank­ fully, scarce. Its strands can be identified by the scintillation they give off even in the dark. The stimulant manipulates the user’s mind by increasing his sensitivity to normal stimu­ li. Whether the spice actually grants the user telepathic powers is hotly debated, although most users certainly believe it does. The spice certainly gives users the ability to “ read" peo­ ple, perhaps through mental powers, or per­ haps through heightened perception. However, prolonged use of glitterstim can turn even the most well-adjusted person into a lifelong ad­ dict who will do anything for another “bite.” also managed to get below the surface told of hid­ eous multi-eyed monsters, ghostly bogeys, and shells of humans roaming the caves in a lifeless stupor. The Old Republic ended millennia of speculators' dreams when they devised a semi-safe route past the Maw using hyperspace beacons. The Senate created KesCorp, a public enterprise formed to supervise the mining and medical research of glitterstim. Only highly trusted and idealistic volunteers were sent to Kessel on paltry government salaries so as to ward off ne’er-do-wells. Initial pharmaceutical usage proved promising, and demand increased accordingly. Nevertheless, as the Republic waned, less attention was paid to Kessel. Criminal elements gradually took the reins of KesCorp and “glitteryll,” a cut of cheap Rylothian ryll with Kesselian spice, became the drug of choice among the rich and powerful. When the Empire rose to power, social workers breathed a sigh of relief when the Empire militarized Kessel, believing the numbers of "glit-biters" would di­ minish. At first, that looked to be the case. The Imperials garrisoned Kessel’s moon and transformed the plane­ toid into a maximum security prison for political rebels, pirates, Black Sun vigos, and criminal psychopaths. That sense of relief has now soured. Although the Empire controls the trade of glitterstim, they have boosted mining efforts by utilizing prisoners as a dis­ posable labor force. Now, more spice is mined than ever, even as the market remains tightly controlled. This situation makes glitterstim smuggling highly profitable, giving rise to the infamous ‘‘Kessel Run,” a smuggling route from Kessel that runs perilously close to the Maw before reaching civilized space. NAL HUTTA Astronavigation Data: Y'Toub system, Hutt.Space, Mid Rim region • Orbital Metrics: 41 3 days per year / 87 hours per day Government: clans Population: 7 billion (Hutts 43%, Humans 28%, Vippits 1 5%, Evocii and other I 4%) Languages: Huttese Terrain: forests, swamps M ajor Cities: Bilbousa (capital), Qedriga, Jiguuna Areas of Interest: Hutt palaces. Nar Shaddaa (moon) M ajor Exports: tourism, contraband M ajor Imports: consumables, luxury goods, technology Trade Routes: Pabol Hutta, Ootmian Pabol, Shag Pabol Special Conditions: breath masks for .the sensitive Background: In Huttese, Nal Hutta means "glorious jewel," though few visitors other than Hutts would ever agree. Tepid swamps cover the surface, mak­ ing for sumptuous conditions for the moisture-loving Hutts. That most species cannot stomach the environ­ meant is no concern; the Hutts know they are in charge when others suffer in their presence. Nal Hutta was not always a bog. When the Hutts' homeworld of Varl fell to plague and cataclysm fifteen • millennia ago. they had their slaves hunt the stars for a planet that would fit their needs. The one they found possessed an indigenous people who called themselves the Evocii, and their world Evocar. The Hutts possessed formidable military power, and with­ in a few years, the Hutts had transformed the world into a paradise for their species. Currently, rivalries between Hutt clans have divided up Nal Hutta, with the choicest and foulest swamps controlled by the most powerful clan at the time. Pos­ session of these locales frequently changes, since no Hutt is ever satisfied with the status quo. This leaves Nal Hutta a festering bed of intrigue, with constant political scheming punctuated by bouts of small-scale conflict between indentured warriors. Straying from or somehow cheating the strict rules of the combat can lead to banishment by the Council of Elders, com­ pelling combatants to find new ways to conceal old tricks in their quest for victory. Although nominally under Imperial control, Nal Hutta remains almost entirely independent. The Hutt philosophies encourage avoiding conflict when one can prevail through other means. They are perfectly happy to allow the Empire to claim dominance, knowing that their stranglehold on regional economics is real power. THE SMUGGLERS'MOON N ar Shaddaa, the largest moon of Nal Hutta. once resembled the planet it orbited, with boundless jungles and the bluest oceans. Those features disappeared within centuries of the Hutts’ appearance in the Y’Toub system. Over the centuries, Nar Shaddaa became a city from pole- to-pole. so overbuilt with spires and spacedocks that residents refer to it as "Little Coruscant." No matter how close it is to the system’s sun, Nar Shaddaa seems to be in a state of perpetual gloom, smogged over from engine exhaust and refueling depots. It has become the perfect place for Hutts to conduct their shady deals. Smugglers come to Nar Shaddaa in droves, looking for employment, gainful or otherwise. Every Hutt has a scheme, and their up-front pay, meager though it may seem, can be tempting to those down on their luck. ORD MANTELL Astronavigation Data: Bright Jewel system, Bright Jewel Sector, Mid Rim region Orbital Metrics: 394 local days in a year / 26 standard hours in a day Government: republic with elected governor Population: 4 billion (varied species) Languages: Basic Terrain: mesas, plains, mountains, islands Major Cities: Worlport (capital), Freelonn, Savroia Areas of Interest: Ten. Mile Plateau, Lady Fate Casino Major Exports: entertainment, tourism, manu­ factured goods. M ajor Imports: consumables, raw materials Trade Routes: Celanon Spur, Entralla Route (con­ nects to Muunilin'st) Special Conditions: none Background: Ord Mantell is a spacer’s paradise. Scoun­ drels and smugglers are welcomed with open arms. Such a concoction of vice and criminality would seem to make the world ungovernable, and indeed Ord Mantell borders on the brink of lawlessness, but that’s been the case since the planet's colonization by Corellians. Originally an Ordnance/Regional Depot for the Old Republic, which gave it the prefix “Ord," the world could never shake loose its Corellian bad habits. Now Mantel- lians—a collective term for the world’s various inhabit­ ants—pride themselves on their “relaxed attitude.” Over the millennia, this open society has attracted all manner of individuals, from tax-evaders and traders to loners and ne’er-do-wells. Open-air markets sell almost any­ thing, and in seedy cantinas transport can be secured for illicit cargo. Nothing is truly illegal on Ord Mantell, and the only tax that is levied is one to vote. For if any­ thing rules Ord Mantell, it's the mighty credit. ORD MANTELL'S CASINOS T he Lady Fate Casino on Worlport’s main drag has lured billions of off-worlders through its doors and relieved untold credits from their pock­ ets. Real gamblers, however, would not be seen spinning Lady Fate’s jubilee wheels. The friendli­ est casinos for the gamblers are located in the side streets and alleys. The Chance Cube in Free­ lonn, Lucky Detooa’s in Savroia, or Throw Me a Bone on Worlport’s Century Lane have some of the highest payouts along the Celanon Spur. The planetary governors and representatives are notorious for taking bribes and legislating favors. Do­ nate enough and one can get away with anything. Courts respect the rights and privileges of bounty hunters, as they see them as a free-market approach to law enforcement. This is not to say the streets of Worlport or Savroia are deathtraps. Cities and casinos contract private security firms for police duty, consid­ ering the safety of the millions of tourists who come each year on gambling holidays their main priority. Beyond the betting strips are stretches of junk­ yards, factories, and strip mines. Farther out along the continental shores linger small fishing, religious, and agricultural communities, which prefer not to be bothered by outlanders and try to remain isolated. A thousand other star systems offer many of the same temptations, though few of them are blessed with Ord Mantell’s location. Situated at the end of the Entralla Route, Ord Mantell serves as the turn onto the Celanon Spur. Only the fastest navicomputers can make the course correction without leaving hyper- space, making Ord Mantell an obvious stop over. The Empire permits Ord Mantell its veneer of inde­ pendence, relying on blackmailing the planetary gov­ ernor rather than outright subjugation. Mantellians, however, are seeing more and more Imperial storm- troopers in their cities. Imperials fear that Ord Man­ tell may become a hideaway for pockets of the Rebel­ lion, and they keep an eye on the planet with fleet maneuvers and a gradual build-up of ground forces. RYLOTH Astronavigation Data: Ryloth sys­ tem, Gaulus Sector, Outer Rim region Orbital Metrics: 305 days per year / 30 hours per day Government: feudalism Population: 1.5 billion (Twi'leks 76%, other 24%) Languages: Twi'lek), Lekku (non­ verbal head-tail communication), Basic, Huttese M ajor Terrain: caves, deserts, mountains, plains M ajor Cities: Lessu (capital), Kala’uun, Roancu Areas of Interest: ryll spice mines. Float­ ing Rock Cardens M ajor Exports: slaves, ryll spice M ajor Imports: consumables, luxury goods, medi­ cines, technology Trade Routes: Corellian Run, Death Wind Corridor (for spice runs) Special Conditions: none Background: For millennia, the Twi'leks of Ryloth have managed to navigate the gray areas of galactic law and structure their economy around two commodities for which there is always a demand; slavery and spice. Experts at negotiation, Twi'leks clan lords skirt anti­ slavery legislation by indenturing lower caste Twi’leks through "free:wilj" contracts, slavery in all but name.. While such habits skirt galactic law. many otherwise law-abiding cultures are only too happy to turn a blind eye to this practice in order to obtain Twi’lek slaves. Spice saved the Twi’leks from becoming a permanent underclass to other species. Thousands of years ago, vast deposits of ryll spice were discovered on Ryloth. Mined from blooms below the surface, ryll could be used as the active agent in both medicines and narcot­ ics. Suddenly, Ryloth had another resource valuable to the galaxy. The clans exploited the spice themselves • rather than outsourcing the labor. As a result, Twi'lek slaves became a much rarer commodity, and fetched higher prices without depleting Ryloth’s population. Visitors to the planet find it a world of harsh condi­ tions. Much of the terrain is rocky and barren, blighted by Ryloth’s sun. Tremendous heat storms roll across the surface without warning, allowing only the hardi­ est of creatures, like the armored lylek, to survive. The weather is more temperate around the equator, where most Twi'lek settlements are located, including the capital city of Lessu. Those Twi’leks who choose to live elsewhere find shelter either below-the surface or shielded behind moun­ tain rock, in cavernous cities like Kala’uun-and Roancu. As Ryloth’s economy is primarily based on exports there is little indigenous industry, and almost all tech­ nology is imported. However, the Twi’leks are not tech­ nophobes; they prefer to maintain their position in the galactic community through bargaining and trade. As anti-alien prejudice grows in the galaxy, the Twi’leks, given their similarities to humans, manage to dilute its impact on Ryloth by ingratiating themselves with Imperial officials. One executive of Sienar Fleet Systems found himself visiting Ryloth so frequently he built corporate offices in Kala’uun’s caves. RYLL SPICE T hough weaker than glitterstim, ryll can still be a dangerous and addictive substance, causing hallucinations and memory loss. Both the Repub­ lic and the Empire placed restrictions on its use, licensing it only to pharmaceutical companies for the production of painkillers and anesthetics. The Twi'lek clans claim they mine ryll for legally approved entities, but that does not explain the millions of shipments that go missing every year. The clans keep the pharmaceutical companies happy by either offering cut-rate prices or add­ ing “a little extra" to the orders. TATOOINE Astronavigation Data: Tattoo system, Arkanis Sector, Outer Rim region Orbital Metrics: 304 local days in a year / 23 standard hours in a day Government: local councils under nominal Imperial governor Population: 200,000 (Humans 70%, Jawas 5%, Tusken Raiders 5%, others 20%, popula­ tions are rough estimates only) Languages: Basic, Jawa, Tusken, Huttese M ajor Terrain: desert M ajor Cities:. Bestine (capital), Anchorhead, Fort Tusken,- Mos Espa, Mos Eisley Areas of Interest: Jundland Wastes, Beggar’s Can­ yon, Jabba's Palace Major Exports: minerals, illegal goods Major Imports.: consumables, technology, chemi­ cals, water Trade Routes: Triellus Trade Route Special Conditions: none Background: "Miserable," “speck.’’ “dust ball"—those are a few of the terms used to describe the'desert world of Tatooine. Though it appears barren, it is far from lifeless. Scattered about its desolate surface are settlements of some of the galaxy's most obstinate individuals. Intracta­ ble moisture farmers perversely sweat gallons to squeeze water from the air and sand. Giant sandcrawters travel­ ing across the dune seas house communities of diminu­ tive Jawas. Wrapped head-to-toe in desert coverings, MOS EISLEY T he city is a warren of pourstone houses and dusty streets, hemmed in by walls that trap the heat. The stench of dewback. ronto, and bantha can be overpowering, so denizens sometimes strap on a breath mask when leaving their homes. Out Del’s Custom Pods and Swoops caters to the racers wanting to thread "the Needle" in Beg­ gar's Canyon, and many a deal can be found at Geordi Hans’s Spaceport Speeders southeast of Docking Bay 94, especially on T-l 6 skyhoppers. Jabba owns a townhouse in the center of the city, mostly to seme as a tribute center and residence for favored guests of the Hutt. When looking for information or a fast ship, step into Chalmun's Cantina. There one can always find a selection of the galaxy’s most interesting species. the Tusken Raiders of the Jundland Wastes attack settlements when the numbers are to their advantage, and otherwise roam the most inhospitable regions atop hardy banthas. Tatooine’s arid terrain alternates between tractless dune seas, jagged rock wastes, and sharp-toothed moun­ tains. These mountains are the hunting ground of some of Tatooine's most dangerous predators, the gigantic krayt dragons. These terrifying creatures are feared and hunted in equal measure, as the pearls in their gizzard are very valuable. The dunes also host vicious predators such as the sessile Sarlaac that consumes its prey and digests them over thousands of years. It is easy to land on Tatooine, but .once stuck, it takes a heroic feat to get off. Villains of all stripes come to this desert believing they can hide from their enemies. Thus, bounty hunters are never at a loss for jobs, and many have made their name here, such as Jodo Kast and Puggles Trodd. Sheer distance from the Core has not lessened Ta­ tooine's role in galactic history. Situated on the Triellus Trade Route near Geonosis, Tatooine’s proximity to the Corellian Run poses it as a lucrative side jump for hardy traders. While the planet has never been the center of events, it always seems to maintain a certain disrepu­ table prominence in the affairs of the Outer Rim. During its reign, the Empire has installed a number of governors to watch over the lawless world, and most do just that—watch. The Hutts are the true mas­ ters of Tatooine. with Jabba as their head. The vast number of miscreants in the population makes Tattoo­ ine a treasure trove of rumors and secrets. T his chaptei\overs what the galaxy is like for the Player Characters in the time of Emperor Palpatine. Alderaan is gone, and so is its instrument of destruction, the Death Star. The Rebel Alliance is now a credible threat to the promised order of the Empire, yet Palpatine's will remains dominant throughout most of the civilized systems. Moffs and governors implement his policies, while the many intelligence and military assets he commands—often through the direction of his apprentice, Darth Vader—en­ force his edicts and expand his power. LAW AND SOCIETY "T h e r e g io n a l g o v e r n o r s n o w h a v e d ir e c t c o n t r o l o v e r t h e i r t e r r it o r ie s . F e a r w ill k e e p t h e . lo c a l's y s t e m s in lin e ." • -Grand Moff Tarkin Despite these overwhelming odds, the very vast­ ness of the Empire's holdings make it quite possible for the crafty and the lucky to make their way and garner a few credits here and there. It isthe wise, how­ ever, who learn all they can about which factions are responsible for what, as well as how the law works wherever they go. The wise, as might be expected, tend to live the longest. THE GALACTIC EMPIRE T he dominant influence on the galaxy, the Galactic Empire shapes the daily lives of every being on every planet, and all of the places between. Such control is accomplished through an elaborate network of military might and bureaucratic sophistry, incorporating both es­ tablished organizations and new factions. Through fear and strictly enforced policies of efficiency, the system works for the most part. However, there are plenty of holes of which to take advantage, which is how anyone choosing to live out­ side of the law enjoys what little freedom there is. TIERS OF ORDER The Empire’s structure is pyramidal in nature, with Em­ peror Palpatine firmly ensconced at the pinnacle. Sur­ rounded by hand-picked advisors and servants cho­ sen from the elite of all services, he projects his plans directly through this pyramid of control. He does so using a wholly re-purposed HoloNet (as per the "Tar- kin Doctrine,” put forth by the late commander of the Death Star) and through direct dispatches he delivers through Darth Vader and other trusted servants. GRAND MOFFS The Grand Moffs exist under the Emperor in position and status, and are individuals of political and mili­ tary might that are most invested in the New Order. They are granted extraordinary power and wealth in exchange for controlling the most difficult regions of the galaxy. These realms of control are called priority sectors, and they may or may not conform to long-es­ tablished sector structures. Planets and systems from any number of connected areas may be reapportioned to a priority sector, primarily for the purpose of enforc­ ing a much greater policy of control and pacification. Grand Moffs are the supreme political and military leaders over their sectors, given total autonomy to act as they see fit, and provided tremendous technological and resource support to accomplish their goals. The em­ peror personally appoints each Grand Moff and they report only to him. The Moffs and governors who fall under a Grand Moff’s jurisdiction have little choice but to accede to any demands he makes, and they are often left dealing with the aftermath of any policy action he undertakes. Some of the more stout-hearted Moffs and other leaders have attempted to point out that the debacle of the Death Star, as well as the loss of the very cre­ ator of the Doctrine that led to the Grand Moff con­ cept, serve as evidence that perhaps the Grand Moffs are given too much independence and resources. The Emperor does not agree, and continues to provide both in abundance to his chosen enforcers. MOFFS The traditional sectors—collections of systems united by proximity, economy, and tradition—fall under the command of the Imperial Moffs. Reporting to one of Palpatine’s advisors, a Moff has command of at least a Sector Group in terms of military resources, and he is responsible for all security and related issues. Moffs are also responsible for the general produc­ tivity of their sectors, which is why most will focus the majority of their attention on the wealthiest and most resource-rich of the planets within their control. Moffs commonly take on the direct governorship of the most important (or most comfortable) of the plan­ ets within their sector, often dispatching top military personnel to see to actual issues and investigations. PLANETARY GOVERNORS Although the vast majority of planets and systems within the Empire are allowed to continue running their affairs in mostly the same fashion as they did under the Republic. The implementation of gover­ nors ensures that Imperial policy drives all decisions and political activity. These governors are Imperial agents, appointed by either Palpatine or his advi­ sors; their rule usually extends to all of the planets within a single star system. Nominally, each governor is in direct command of all Imperial military forces garrisoned on and around his planets. In reality, his leadership tends to be more a matter of advice and direction; the Imperial Navy, in particular, will generally ignore a governor in favor of its own objectives, unless that governor enjoys the support of the Moff who commands the sector. Unless a planet's policies and culture run contrary to Imperial doctrine, a governor will tend to maintain an observe-and-advise posture with traditional leader­ ship. In the case where such leadership is in conflict with the Emperor’s wishes, however, anything from di­ plomacy to coercion might be employed to bring the government more in line. In extreme cases, the gover­ nor will simply take over and rule directly, in the name of the Empire. COMPNOR The Commission for the Preservation of the New Order, or COMPNOR, was built on the founda­ tion of a similar such political entity that existed within the Republic. However, this organization is decidedly committed to both the person and the policies of Emperor Palpatine, and it has become his personal machine of political power throughout the galaxy. At first, COMPNOR seemed little more than a social organization of primarily younger and highly devoted followers of the Emperor. Through the manipulations of wise advisors like Crueya Vandron and Sate Pestage, Palpa­ tine was quickly able to transform COMPNOR into a powerful force, one he could utilize in many effective ways. By filling the ranks with ide­ ological enthusiasts and pandering to their hopes and fears, the Emperor crafted a body politic truly vast in size and scope. By enveloping key political, mili­ tary, and economic leaders into the elitist Select Com­ mittee, he gathered the most powerful and influential people in the galaxy directly into his service. For every battle the Imperial Military has won, COMPNOR has won countless others through dip­ lomatic, bureaucratic, and economic manipulation. There is not a Moff or military officer who doesn’t have to consider COMPNOR with every decision he makes or plan he puts into action. The complexity of the organization is tremen­ dous, but a few key factions within COMPNOR de­ mand some attention for anyone negotiating his way through Imperial space. COMPFORCE Comprised of the idealistic youth driven to serve Emperor Palpatine’s grand vision, CompForce is the military arm of COMPNOR. It provides both frontline Assault troops for direct combat against the Rebel Alliance and other enemies, and Observation volun­ teers who seek to learn the intricacies of the Imperial Military before formally pursuing an officer’s career or some other key role in COMPNOR. In truth, Observe personnel mostly serve to en­ sure absolute loyalty among the career officers of the Army and the Navy. While many are am bitious to a fault, most are truly sincere in th eir efforts to encourage u tte r loyalty and service to the New Order. Not surprisingly, the interference of an O b­ serv operative has led to more than one shortened m ilitary career, often followed by an otherwise highly trained and capable m ilitary man seeking his fortunes in the Outer Rim. Meanwhile, CompForce Assault soldiers (of which only around twelve percent even get past basic train­ ing) are simply insanely brave and mostly inept shock troops, fed into extremely difficult combat situations in order to preserve more valuable military assets. However, as more and more of these exceedingly loyal Assault troops gain experience through survival, they become highly valuable soldiers that serve the Select Committee and the Emperor above all others. IMPERIAL SECURITY BUREAU Direct rivals to Imperial Intelligence, the Imperial Se­ curity Bureau (ISB) is the Emperor’s personal “secret police" force. ISB command reports directly to the Se­ lect Committee and, through it, to the Emperor. Natu­ rally, this makes the ISB the most feared and hated organization in the entire galaxy. The ISB is tasked with gathering intelligence on all po­ tential threats and influences on Imperial doctrine, and the organization is also granted full autonomy to seek out and deal with such threats in any way necessary. This makes the ISB one of the most likely foes of any group of outlaws that operates in contradiction with Imperial law. The ISB is vast in scope and well funded. While its operatives may not be of quite the same caliber as those of Imperial Intelligence, they are genuinely com­ mitted and enjoy a wealth of resources and backup as they need it. The largest branch within the organiza­ tion is Surveillance, comprising thirty-five percent of its personnel. Other branches include Investigations, Internal Affairs, Re-Education, and Enforcement. Possibly the most disturbing fact for anyone who might find himself the subject of ISB ire is the cad­ re of storm troopers that serve the Bureau directly. As a general rule, they are even more fanatically loyal and more critical in their thinking, making them some of the most dangerous individuals to wear the white armor. THE COALITION FOR PROGRESS While most of the elements of this culturally redefin­ ing arm of COMPNOR have little relevance to those living and working in the fringes of galactic society, there are two key groups with which anyone operating outside of the law will need to concern himself. One is the Justice division, which has direct control over the Imperial Office of Criminal Investigations (100), and the other is the Commerce division. Criminals most often find themselves up against the IOCI. These law-enforcement specialists work with all other elements of Imperial structure, including Imperial Intelligence and the military, as well as other COMP- NOR-administered factions. The IOCI also supervises the Sector Rangers—independent and long-respected providers of law and order in the farthest sectors of the galaxy. As a general rule, IOCI agents don’t tend to be too zealous about Imperial doctrine, though this in no way makes them lenient about enforcing the law. Prior to the Battle of Yavin, the Commerce division primarily concerned itself with expanding economic development, especially in the less-developed sectors. This led to achievements such as the formation of the highly profitable Corporate Sector Authority. However, following the destruction of the Death Star, Commerce’s focus shifted toward corporate espionage and related activities. Commerce agents can now be found infiltrat­ ing many companies and financial operations, seeking to turn the flow of credits and technology away from the Rebellion. At the same time, these agents will gladly shut down any enterprising group that seeks to avoid giving the Empire its due. IMPERIAL INTELLIGENCE Formed in the waning days of the Old Repub­ lic, Imperial Intelligence enjoys the estab­ lished networks and assets of four older agencies, all effectively combined un­ der the command and control of the highly secretive Ubiqtorate. This legacy serves the organization well in terms of effectiveness and institutional knowledge, yet it also creates just enough suspi­ cion among Palpatine’s highest advisors to necessitate the exis­ tence of the ISB. Despite this division of labor and resources (a conflict that Imperial Intelligence comes out on the short end of repeatedly), the agency does a rather excellent job at serving the Empire in all of its real needs. While the ISB focuses prim arily on political and internal threats, Imperial Intelli­ gence is more concerned with m ilitary and related external threats. Even so, the crossover between the two agencies creates difficulties time and time again, which ultim ately serves those in opposition to the Empire. The structure of Imperial Intelligence is complex and detailed, probably an artifact of combining four different organizations and integrating all of th eir previous specialties into one whole. If any fringe group should come under the scrutiny of this organization, they are probably in for some truly serious trouble. They will most likely find themselves under the scrutiny of a system cell— the nearly independent smaller units of agents stationed all over the galaxy. If the system cell determines the group to be a pos­ sible asset, the Bureau of Operations (simply known as the Bureau in the ranks) may send one or more Infiltration agents to find out more about what the group is doing. If the cell isn’t so impressed, its com­ mander may either decide to simply deal with the group at his level, or request Assassination branch agents to deal with them. Should the group somehow prove to be resistant to such methods, the Ubiqtorate may decide to call upon its most elite branch of special agents, Adjust­ ments. These agents are the most efficient and ca­ pable troubleshooters the Empire can possibly call upon; if a group of fringers warrants their attention, the story has taken a truly dramatic turn. IMPERIAL MILITARY The true might of the Empire is embodied in the tens of trillions of uniformed personnel serving in the Impe­ rial Military. With the adoption of the Tarkin Doctrine, which promotes the fear of overwhelming military might as the ultimate deterrent to any who would defy the Emperor’s will, the Empire pours countless credits and resources into the upkeep and improvement of one of the greatest military forces ever assembled. THE NAVY The foundational backbone of the entire military struct­ true is the Imperial Navy, commanding the systems and sectors of the Empire with exceptional mobility and massive firepower. Under the command of expe­ rienced and highly trained senior officers, each ship of the Navy is part of a well-oiled machine that responds to dictates from the Emperor, Imperial High Command, Grand Moffs, and Moffs—in that order. Planetary gov­ ernors can do little more than politely request (or beg) for Naval assistance at any time of crisis. Unless tasked with searching for a particular target that their commanders have deemed of significant im­ portance or threat, the typical Naval officer will rarely bother involving his ship and his crew with local dis­ putes, itinerant traders that might be smugglers, or any­ thing else that the average individual living on the fringes is likely involved in. Only if important Imperial assets or installations are somehow involved will an incident po­ tentially call down the might of local Naval vessels. THE ARMY Growing even more rapidly than the Navy as the Emperor rose to power, the Imperial Army went from a pathetic organization of peacekeepers and facility guards to a mighty, multifaceted force capable of enacting Palpatine’s will on countless worlds. Through careful planning and lo­ gistical genius, the Emperor was able to rapidly expand the Army in terms of personnel, training, and resources, all for the purpose of bringing his New Order to a hard and emphatic reality. In the days following the Battle of Yavin, an already dramatically over­ hauled Army found itself becoming more and more integrated with the Navy. This creates a combined arms functionality that works surpris­ ingly well for both organizations. Through tradition and ne­ cessity, the Navy enjoys the superior position overall, yet the Imperial Army greatly benefits from the Navy’s much improved logistics and combat support role. Ultimately, this means that the military can rapidly enact ground operations nearly anywhere in the galaxy, since all fleets now have significant Army assets as­ signed to them. At the same time, these ground opera­ tions enjoy the immediate firepower and logistical sup­ port of the Navy, ensuring a high degree of success and the ability to sustain operations over a lengthy period. The loss of the Death Star did little to decrease mo­ rale or give pause to the Army. If anything, the Army is more ready than ever to prove that no weapon of mass destruction can take the place of a highly trained and motivated ground force willing to take a planet in the name of the Emperor. STORMTROOPERS A completely separate military branch, the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps answers directly to the Emperor, via Stormtrooper Command. Evolved from the original Clone Troopers that served the Old Republic in its wan­ ing days, the Stormtrooper Corps is the ultimate shock troop force. Faceless and clad in gleaming white armor, the arrival of a contingent of stormtroopers is often enough to bring any conflict to an immediate halt. One of the most im portant advantages of stor­ mtroopers is their capacity to be deployed rapidly into any situation, usually for the purpose of bru- tallv eliminating enemv elements and oacifvine the local population. With their exceptional training and unquestioning loyalty, stormtroopers can be deployed independent of other m ilitary forces for an extended period of time, often sweeping through resistant forces even as the Army and Navy scram­ ble to catch up to them. In the decades since the Clone Wars, the Empire has recruited many non-clones into the ranks of the Stormtroopers. W hether this is because the original clone facilities were dismantled or de­ stroyed, the older Clone Troopers are dying of old age and a ttritio n , or some combination of both, is unknown. However, training facilities on planets such as Carida now induct human recruits into the Storm trooper Corps. There they go through in­ tense indoctrination and rigorous training to rec­ reate the skill and fanatical loyalty bred into the original Clone Troopers’ genes. IMPERIAL CUSTOMS Although w orking hand-in-hand with the Imperial Navy (even sporting uniforms that are hard for the untrained eye to distinguish), Imperial Customs is actually a separate agency with its own profile and agenda. Prim arily responsible for m onitoring im ports and exports through Imperial space, as well as seeing to it th a t all taxes and tariffs are collected, the agency also interdicts suspected smugglers, pirates, and other crim inals acting against the laws th a t protect the Empire’s in te r­ stellar commerce revenue. The agency has its own fleet, made up prim ar­ ily of Imperial Customs corvettes. There are also many space stations, such as the Golan III defense platforms, located strategically throughout the galaxy to m onitor m ajor hyperspace lanes. Most Customs posts also enjoy strong support from whatever Imperial Navy assets are local to them, and there are usually storm troopers imm ediately available for enforcem ent operations. Though the average spacer has call to generally dislike the Customs agency, there are times when the organization proves to be handy. Most search-and- rescue operations for crippled and lost ships—more and more considered a waste of time and resources by the Navy—are taken on by Imperial Customs. On the other hand, the Commerce branch of COMPNOR has begun requisitioning Customs as­ sets and personnel in its never-ending effort to shut down supplies and technological support for the Rebellion. These actions have drawn the agency further into the Galactic Civil War, something many in the leadership of Customs find to be a poor use of their resources. DEALING W ITH THE EMPIRE For Player Characters, keeping out of the way of the Empire is likely one of their highest priorities. The very nature of most of their professions and activities puts them at odds with the New Order. Even those who might have good cause to seek employment from Im­ perial agents—such as Bounty Hunters—will likely want to keep interactions to a minimum. The safest course of action where the Empire is concerned is generally to not be anywhere the Empire finds important, nor be caught doing anything the Empire doesn’t like. Unfortunately, this isn’t always easy. While storm- troopers and uniformed soldiers can be seen coming from kilometers away, other agents of the Empire are not always so easy to spot. The bigger the potential reward of any job is, the more likely an Imperial spy of some kind may be in the mix somewhere. Some of the ways a fringer group might find itself crossing paths with the Empire include: • A planetary governor, or even a Moff, might hire the group for a clandestine operation intended to increase his wealth or power. • One or more of the group might have enough of a political past to be of interest to COMPNOR agents. • The group might come across a CompForce at­ tack against a generally helpless community, or against allies that are ill-equipped to deal with such a brutal attack. • Any number of the group might well be the target of an ISB investigation, making them wanted for arrest, or at least questioning. • Perhaps someone in the group committed a crime, one that the 100 has finally assigned de­ tectives to. Worse, Sector Rangers might be as­ signed to track down the group. • Legitimate or not, the group might be suspected of ties to the Rebellion, making it the target of Imperial Intelligence efforts. • With the wrong jump point at the wrong time, the group may well stumble across one of the Imperial Navy’s many secret operations against the Alliance. • Almost every facility under direct control of the Em­ pire is guarded by a contingent of stormtroopers. • Imperial Customs are going to be a constant thorn for any smuggler, or anyone flying through Imperial space without the proper identification signals, carrying things he doesn’t want the Em­ pire to know about. THE ALLIANCE TO RESTORE THE REPUBLIC A lthough the Empire’s propaganda machine would have the general populace believe the Rebellion is nothing more than a ragtag bunch of pirates, malcon­ tents, and revolutionaries, the Alliance represents a real threat to the New Order and hope for the galaxy. The Alliance struggles in a truly titanic fight for sur­ vival, but it does so with a keen eye for the future it desires. Nonetheless, desperate times do indeed call for desperate measures, which can appeal to fringers seeking opportunities for credits and altruism. THE CIVIL GOVERNMENT The Alliance structure is split into two major organiza­ tions, the Civil Government and the Military. Mon Moth- ma, the elected Chief of State and Commander in Chief, focuses most of her attention on civil issues and wisely leaves military matters in more experienced hands. While the recent successes of the military, especially the destruction of the Death Star, have elevated the Al­ liance in the eyes of much of the galaxy, the political and diplomatic maneuverings of the Civil Government secure the vital long-term support needed to keep the Rebellion going. Without the successful negotiations with the Mon Calamari, who then provided access to their renowned ship-building capabilities, the Alliance would have died at Yavin. While the Rebellion is founded on admirable ideals, it must be pragmatic to survive. Though she is nowhere near as ruthless as Palpatine, Mon Mothma is more than willing to use tactics that may not qualify as par­ ticularly moral or above-board to obtain vital goals. This is where enterprising fringers can benefit in their dealings with Alliance representatives. Their cof­ fers may not match the Empire’s, but there’s enough resources at hand for the Alliance to see to the needs of those who do good work for them. From transport of supplies and key personnel to acquiring key data or items from secure locations, there are opportuni­ ties for those who choose to work behind the scenes and in the shadows, breaking Imperial law. ATTHETOP By necessity, the Alliance runs as a benevolent dictator­ ship, placing ultimate power in the Chief of State’s hands in order to operate in effective opposition to the Empire. Unlike Palpatine’s advisors, however, the Alliance’s Ad­ visory Council has a strong influence on Mon Mothma, and she also has a Cabinet that works fairly efficiently to administer the various functions of the Alliance govern­ meant. Some of these positions deal with current issues, others prepare for the elusive day when the Alliance may be able to operate as a real government. Unlikely as it is that any fringer group would have di­ rect dealing with the highest echelons of the Alliance Civil Government, it remains possible that a particularly effective group may find itself brought to the attention of those that run things from the top. Most likely, the group would first encounter representatives of the Min­ ister of War or the Minister of Supply, since they’re likely to require a fringe group’s services. ALLIED COMMANDS Long before fringers find themselves talk­ ing to the likes of Mon Mothma, they’ll get jobs from representatives of a particular Allied Command. Though larger military and related efforts are run at the higher levels, day- to-day administration, gover­ nance, and defense efforts are managed by each of the Allied Commands that are structured under the Chief of State. Right from the beginning, Mon Mothma, Bail Organa, and other founders of the Alliance understood that trying to homogenize all of the unique and dynamic cultures of the galaxy was to be one of Palpatine’s greatest failures, and a mistake they had no desire to repeat. To that end, the structure of the Alliance allows for each Allied organization that signs on to remain an autonomous body, functioning in the manner traditional and comfortable for its people. The offices of the Chief of State and the Cabinet Ministers are mimicked by each Allied Command, yet these offices are filled by whatever analog makes the most sense from that culture’s point of view. As such, the Secretary of Supply for a given Alliance member state may be a hereditary post, a full council, or a droid assigned to do the task. ALLIANCE INTELLIGENCE Though directly under the command of the Alliance Military, Alliance Intelligence operates fairly indepen­ dently, and has a strong role in both military and civil matters. Not a single effort of political or economic importance is undertaken by the Alliance’s represen­ tatives without a thorough investigation and report by Intelligence to the Ministers and the Chief of State. The most likely path to working with the Rebellion is through contact with Alliance Intelligence. This branch most represents the willingness to do whatever it takes to get the resources and information needed, as well as to handle any direct threats to the survival of the Alliance. This means its methods can be subtle, secretive, and underhanded, and this makes fringers an attractive source of talent for Intelligence agents in need of help to get a job done. THE UPPER LEVELS The upper echelon of Alliance Intelligence is organized into three branches: Intentions, Operations, and Coun­ ter-Intelligence. The Chief of Intelligence—currently Gen­ eral Airen Cracken—and his staff run the entire opera­ tion, and report directly to both the Chief of State and the Supreme Commanders of the rest of the military. Intentions compiles data from untold sources and at­ tempts to predict the actions of the Imperial Military and other assets. They do this with their Cryptology, Analysis, and Interrogation divisions. At the same time, Intentions oversees the Equipment division, which de­ signs and implements the various high-tech pieces of equipment used for surveillance and other covert needs. Operations, the largest of the three, fields the teams and agents who perform direct actions against the Empire. System Ops handles the majority of the work—managing the networks of cells that see to the intelligence needs on a key planet. For larger or more involved projects, the Coordinate division takes charge; they bring the best and brightest together to manage long-term and delicate operations meant to bring down entire Imperial organizations. The ironically named Pas­ sive Operations division performs the really dangerous work, however. Comprised of the toughest and deadliest commandos, assassins, and special forces types in the Alliance, these operatives handle missions destined for high casualty rates, including rescue operations, facility destruction, and search-and-destroy missions. The Counter-Intelligence branch serves the primary role of protecting the Alliance from internal dangers, making its mission both vital and entirely unpopular. They install Security division operatives in every single other branch and division in the Alliance, on constant alert for suspicious activity and any sign of infiltration. Whenever someone becomes suspected of destructive activity, the Retrieval division performs a full investiga­ tion and, if necessary, interrogation. SECTOR COMMANDS Should a group of fringers find itself in the employ of Alliance Intelligence, they’ve most likely had contact with a member of a Sector Command cell. The isolated structure and strict contact protocols of these cells will make it next to impossible for non-Alliance personnel to make contact with anyone higher up the network chain. However, truly effective work combined with a clear dislike of the Empire may result in someone from higher in the chain reaching out to the group. Any first contact with an Alliance Intelligence cell will be through a single entity, who simply hires the fring­ ers for the kind of work they seem likely to be able to carry out. It is entirely possible that the Player Char­ acters have no idea they are working for the Alliance in any way, perhaps even over the course of multiple jobs. All the while, reports will be transmitted through blind contact protocols up through the network, to be evaluated by area coordinators, then network leaders. Eventually, if the network leader is duly impressed (or if the need is both great and desperate enough), he may pass on a recommendation to bring the group further into the organization. ALLIANCE MILITARY Though a fraction of the size of the Imperial war machine, the military forces of the Alliance are lean and highly effective in exactly the kind of hit-and-run warfare required for them to survive. Because of the guerrilla warfare nature of their strategy, it is entirely possible for Rebel military operations to employ local specialists to help with a tricky operation. Most fringers are likely to avoid any direct involve­ meant with military actions against the Empire; this, naturally, makes them fairly unpopular with the aver­ age trooper serving in Alliance ranks. However, those in command who recognize the value of non-standard assets often find a use for a local crew that can be mo­ tivated by a few credits or other helpful resources. ALLIANCE MILITARY COMMAND The overall structure of the Alliance Military, as initially organized by Bail Organa, is a highly flexible one that allows for integrated coordination with the various and disparate forces available to Alliance High Command. This necessary flexibility keeps the Rebellion alive and functional, taking advantage of the many different re­ sources and capabilities that each ally brings into the mix. Such a structure also makes it much easier to uti­ lize non-standard assets like a group of fringers. ance High Command, mostly due to the majority of resources being hoarded for much bigger and grander operations. The very survival of such a force may well depend on the willingness of some smugglers to get food, medicines, and weapons through a blockade. DEALING W ITH THE ALLIANCE Getting involved with the Alliance won't necessary­ ily be easy, even if a group really wants to. Hiding is something the Rebels have become very good at, and while they are actively recruiting and seeking support, they are also doing everything they can to avoid Imperial agents. Someone in the group may already have ties to the Alliance, which could help with initial contact. The Alliance may keep a group pri­ marily interested in profit at arm’s length. A mutually beneficial financial relationship is not out of the question, but truly mercenary minds won't be consid­ ered particularly reliable by anyone of importance with the Alliance. Some of the ways fringers might find themselves involved with the Alliance include: •A member of an Alliance Intelli­ gence cell th a t’s been compromised may need immediate help, either get­ ting off-planet or getting his last report to his area coordinator or network leader, and the fringers are the only ones he can call on. • The Alliance Military command wants to get some desperately needed supplies to a Sector force that’s holding a key position, a job at which smugglers excel. • Alliance Intelligence needs to get a group of Pas­ sive Operations commandos into Hutt space for a special mission, and they need someone who knows the way of things there. Of course, help­ ing the Rebellion cause some kind of trouble for the Hutts could seriously come back to haunt a fringer group. • One of the fringers’ best friends or relatives joined up with the Rebellion, and word reaches the group that his unit has been captured and is being transported to Imperial space for interroga­ tion and public execution. Along with the already-discussed Intelligence Com­ mand, there are six others: Fleet, Ordnance and Supply, Starfighter, Support Services, Spec Forces, and Sector. The likelihood of fringers dealing with any of these com­ mands directly is fairly low at first, yet there may come a day when they’ve made some choices that bring them more fully into the bigger picture of the Rebellion. SECTOR COMMANDS If fringers find themselves caught up in Rebel active­ ity, it is most likely at the sector level. These are the forces fighting the war locally, defending their homes and trying to overthrow Imperial rule over their plan­ ets and their people. Unfortunately, the very fact that most such forces really need whatever help they can get may result in a group of fringers getting in way over their heads. Sector forces get very little direct support from Alli­ BLACK SUN N e ll over three thousand years ago, a confederation w o f gang lords and criminal masterminds united on Coruscant to claim vast territories and resources within the planet-wide city in the wake of the Great Galactic War. Tenacious, well-led, and adaptable, Black Sun be­ came a galaxy-spanning organization that far exceed­ ed the Old Republic’s capacity to combat. As the Galactic Civil War rages on, those who know of Black Sun’s extensive reach and control suggest the organization is at least as powerful as the Alliance, and possibly a real threat to Imperial power as well. Few can say for certain, however, just how massive Black Sun is, or how far its reach really extends. The leadership goes to great pains to ensure that Black Sun’s involvement in any enterprise is well hidden from the galaxy at large. Often, a criminal venture can appear to be a wholly in­ dependent operation, with even the ostensible leader having no idea he’s embroiled with the Black Sun. Smuggling, slavery, racketeering, kidnapping, extor­ tion, spice, illegal weapons, and all other manner of illegal activity lie within Black Sun’s purview. At the same time, the organization has grown so powerful as to own many businesses and corporations, and even a few planets here and there. If there is a way to earn credits, Black Sun has someone doing it for them. ORGANIZATION For all of its many holdings and byzantine intercon­ nections throughout the galaxy, the central leader­ ship of Black Sun is fairly straightforward. The known galaxy is divided up into nine “territories,” over which there are nine Vigos. The term is an old Tionese word meaning "nephew," which is meant to further ce­ meant the idea that a great and powerful family runs the whole organization. This projects both a unified front and creates a sense of familial obligation among many who serve. The currently known Vigos are a Ro- dian, Clezo; Durga the Hutt; the Fluman known simply as Green; Kreet’ah, a Kian’thar; Lonay, a Twi'lek; Perit, a Mon Calamari; Sprax, a Nalroni; Vekker, a Quarren; and Wumdi, the Etti Vigo over the Corporate Sector. Above all of the Vigos is the Underlord, a veritable emperor in his own right. Black Sun’s current Under- lord is Prince Xizor, a member of the Falleen race with a mysterious past. Though he has hundreds of set­ vants and warriors to call upon at a moment’s notice— and can organize an army of many thousands within hours—Xizor’s most prominent associate is the stun­ ning Guri, a blond-haired, blue-eyed picture of human beauty and cool efficiency. Those who are high enough in the organization to know realize she is Xizor’s trusted lieutenant, major-domo, and bodyguard. Those not as knowledgeable tend to assume she is the one who runs Black Sun. A very few suspect there is something amiss with Guri, and that she is not as human as she appears. Each of the Vigos oversees a rather vast network of his own, with numerous sub-lieutenants managing each of the many disparate operations. In order to protect the greater organization, people beneath the Vigos only tend to know a few others that are actually part of Black Sun; there are, in fact, countless thousands employed by Black Sun who have no idea who their real employer is. Smaller gangs and groups with their own names and identities operate with apparent independence, with only their leadership connected to the higher levels. Much of the funding for outward activities comes from Prince Xizor himself, primarily through his lucrative and legitimate corporation, Xizor Transport Systems. Through this vast transportation company and its many thou­ sands of freighters and other craft, there isn’t a place Black Sun cannot reach or cargo that cannot be moved. The machinery of resource flow is greased liberally with substantial bribes and payoffs to all of the right officials. ACTIVITIES Black Sun’s activities are many and varied, and each Vigo tends to focus on his or her own portfolio of interests. Clezo is conservative and business-minded. He prefers to maintain a highly diverse portfolio of activities, seek­ ing to control all criminal activity within a few systems rather than corner a particular market or criminal under­ taking. His holdings are known to include several bounty hunting groups and guilds, including the highly Imperial- connected House Tresario guild. Careful planning and maintaining the revenue flow are his trademarks, and though he constantly seeks new opportunities, he never does so at the expense of his current operations. Durga is as scheming and crafty as any other Hutt, and his primary concerns seem to revolve around ma­ nipulating other Vigos while appearing the loyal and subservient lieutenant to Xizor. His endeavors include exploiting all of the transport and smuggling in and around Nar Shaddaa, and keeping a firm grasp on the Klatooinian Trade Guild’s operations. Durga has a healthy interest in gun-running and slavery, and serves as Black Sun’s connection to Hutt affairs while also serving the Hutts through this connection to Black Sun. Of course, ultimately, Durga serves himself. Green spends a great deal of his time and energy trying to organize resources and support to become the next Underlord. His revenues are far lower than they should be, yet his value as a spymaster with tru­ ly extensive networks remains high enough to keep him in his position for now. Racketeering, extortion, and blackmail in the Core Worlds are his main stocks in trade. He is trying to expand his spice smuggling efforts, yet has been directly forbidden to export to Coruscant; another has been granted exclusive rights to that highly lucrative market. Kreet’ah, who inherited his position from his mother, is a loyal and long-serving lieutenant of Xizor. His main focus as a Vigo is corporate espionage. This includes stealing valuable secrets and technology, massive rev­ enue slicing, and using his extensive spy network to re­ route transports, manipulate markets, and extort funds from countless corrupt corporate officers. His most valuable service to Xizor is his ability to predict and convey market trends and corporate maneuverings. Anyone working in the Outer Rim has a chance of running afoul of Lonay's operations. The Twi'lek focuses his efforts on several sectors in that part of the galaxy, building allies not only among the Black Sun, but with other criminal groups and even corporations. His highly flexible organization focuses on the typical Outer Rim endeavors of slave trading, spice smuggling, gun-run­ ning, and countless vice crimes. The rise of the Rebel­ lion has caused a great deal of trouble for Lonay’s slave trading operations. Ironically, he’s made up some of the losses by smuggling weapons and supplies to desper­ ate Alliance Sector forces even as the Alliance works to systematically shut down his other operations. Ex-slave and master sheer Perit has, perhaps, the most secure position of any of the Vigos, though that hasn’t prevented him from reportedly surrounding himself with nigh-impenetrable electronic security and a small force of assassin droids. Prince Xizor de­ livered the Mon Calamari from slavery and directly employed him to help manage the Prince’s holdings when still a Vigo himself. A master of technological and computerized crime, Perit is able to manipulate entire markets via slicing, and his veritable army of technologists is one of the greatest assets in the en­ tire Black Sun organization. Once Xizor became Un­ derlord, he handed over his Vigo position to Perit, who became both a trusted friend and powerful ally. Another likely potential employer for fringers, Sprax is Black Sun’s master of shipping and transport. His holdings and activities may have the widest pos­ sible range of galactic area of any Vigo, running from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories. He has multiple syndicates of pirates, smugglers, shipjackers, black market traders, slavers, and the like all work­ ing for him; most of them have no idea they are tied to Black Sun. He also manages corporate assets re­ lated to shipping, and he’s created such a serpentine network of connections and conflicting interests as to make it impossible to know what he's really up to at any given moment. Interestingly, Sprax does a great deal of trade in ships, weapons, and supplies to the Rebellion, apparently with Xizor’s blessing. The most stable and least ambitious of all the Vigos is Vekker, who came to power by simply being patient and loyal. His criminal empire is, for the most part, not particularly criminal; he oversees a rather vast empire of casinos and entertainment businesses. There are the usual vice-related criminal activities that go along with much of his territory’s interests, yet he mainly fo­ cuses on keeping the paying customers happy by the billions and, thus, keeping the steady revenue flow­ ing. As his holdings serve well as legitimate fronts and laundering opportunities for the rest of Black Sun, this keeps him in decent standing with his fellows. The unique entity that is the Corporate Sector is an exceptional opportunity for Black Sun, and the Vigo Wumdi handles exploiting that opportunity. A master of the economics and politics of the Authority, Wumdi knows best when to place his bets and when to cut- and-run. With a powerful network of bribed officials, spies, droids, and specialists, he is well situated to make the most of every boon or crisis that affects the Corporate Sector. His efforts cover the gamut, include­ ing vice crimes, smuggling, corporate espionage, rev­ enue slicing, and more. Wumdi’s position is not as se­ cure as he would like to believe, though—his exorbitant skimming of Black Sun profits has not gone unnoticed. At the top of it all, Prince Xizor has his own agenda and activities. With Curi able to efficiently manage the day-to-day operations, he is afforded the luxury of at­ tending to personal projects. Little is known about his goals, but there is strong evidence that he is interested in playing the Alliance and the Empire against each other. Some rumors indicate a powerful enmity with none other than the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader. DEALING W ITH BLACK SUN Getting involved with Black Sun is a dangerous propo­ sition. The organization tends to get its hooks deep into everyone who becomes a part of it, with virtually no options to get back out again. Nonetheless, the vast majority of illicit credits (and more than a few honest ones) are to be made working with Black Sun in one way or another. A group with a particularly ne­ farious past may even already have ties to Black Sun, or worse, Obligations. Here are a few of the many ways a group of fringers might find themselves in the Black Sun's employ: • Smuggling and transport is a huge part of both the legitimate and illegal operations of Black Sun, and one more light transport with a crew of mis­ creants is just what the organization likes to hire. • There may come a tim e when the group's ship requires some highly expensive repairs; Perit's people in particular are always on the lookout for a chance to make such a group indebted to the Black Sun. • Sometimes it is best to bypass the usual bounty no­ tices and other practices in favor of a less-tradition­ al approach to capturing (or eliminating) a target. A group of fringers may be just what an enterprising Vigo is looking for in such situations; the trick will be not getting eliminated after doing the job. THE MANDALORIANS T he Mandalorian clans have produced many of the most dangerous bounty hunters, mer­ cenaries, and warriors in the known galaxy. The Mandalorians are composed of various clans that share a common culture across ties of gen­ der, family, and even species—by far, most Man­ dalorians have been human, but there are many examples of non-human Mandalorians who have carved out quite impressive reputations. Mandalorians are known for their unmistakable and formidable armor, particularly the helms with a T-shaped visor. Originally, Mandalorians were unit­ ed in a warrior culture bent on conquest, and this focus drove them into conflict with the Republic on many occasions. The Mandalorians had forged nu­ merous ties with the Sith Empire, and the Jedi Or­ der had become a name that Mandalorians asso­ ciated with distrust and aggression. Mandalorians attempted unsuccessfully to conquer the galaxy, and even after their defeat, Mandalorian mercenar­ ies were a common and terrible sight in the galaxy's many wars of old. However, after millennia of warfare, Mandalorian culture shifted from militarism to peace. The cube cities of the planet Mandalore no longer generate the warrior culture of old. In fact, the planet served as a focal point for the neutrality movement during the Clone Wars. However, some remain true to Mandalore’s bloody past. Whether violent revolutionaries who want to overthrow Mandalore’s government, hard-bitten mercenaries willing to use their skills for credits, or skilled warriors trying to merge the Mandalorian mercenary legacy with honor and a warrior’s code, some still ensure the sight of Man­ dalorian battle armor is not forgotten in the galaxy. • Perhaps a friend or loved one is deep in debt, or is otherwise in serious trouble with a Black Sun agent or leader. His only hope is to turn to the fringers for help, which creates a messy and sticky web for all concerned. • What might happen if a group of moderately capable fringers became pawns in a power-play between two opposing Vigos? Worse, what hap­ pens if someone like Green tries to pit the group against Prince Xizor’s people? • Success, at least in some endeavors, can have a real price. Perhaps the group becomes so adept at certain activities that Black Sun sends someone to either recruit them or eliminate the competition. • As a means of getting out of legal trouble, the fringers might be offered a chance to have their records cleaned up. All they have to do is infil­ trate a Black Sun operation and help bring it down. Prison might be the smarter course. THE HUTTS T o the rest of the galaxy, the Hutts represent both a species and an organization of great power and influence. The familiar nature of everything the Hutts do stems from their sense of collective su­ periority over all other species, and the immense economic and strategic power of their clans, called kajidics. Though not all Hutts are involved in crim i­ nal and underworld activities, so many are that it hardly matters to the galaxy at large. Accumulated over their long lives and passed on through elaborate inheritance protocols through their ka­ jidics, wealth is the true power of the Hutts. With it, they hire all of the professionals they need for every operation they oversee, and they purchase all the slaves they require to serve their needs and their exorbitant whims. Though younger Hutts are capable of movement and physical activity, the majority of the species sees corpulence and luxurious inactivity as the ultimate expression of power. Though the scope of Hutt power does not range as far and wide as that of Black Sun, the latter organization respects the absolute hold of the Hutts over the sectors and systems they claim. This includes a large swath of Outer Rim territories, referred to as Hutt Space. SOCIETY AND ORGANIZATION As stated, Hutt crime activities are a family affair, yet the sight of more than one Hutt in any given space is incredibly rare. Each Hutt in a kajidic will take up resi­ dence where he can directly oversee and manage a criminal operation, surrounding himself with soldiers, servants, and specialists to do all of the work neces­ sary. Most Hutts also surround themselves with opu­ lence, though individual tastes vary. Those who work for a Hutt tend to make a good living for themselves, though mistakes and disloy­ alty can result in a very short lifespan. Virtually no non-Hutt, however, ever achieves a rank of any distinction among the Hutts; such roles are reserved only for Hutts who are part of the par­ ticular clan in question. Their collective ego and ' arrogance stems from surviving the destruction of their homeworld, giving them a sense of god- hood as per their own mythology. Much of the overall strategy and coordinated efforts of the Hutts originates on their new homeworld, Nal Hutta. Though originally the various kajidics competed fiercely with one another with a kind of weeding-out phi­ losophy, Jabba Desilijic Tiure worked hard to convince his people that they were such a superior spe­ cies it behooved them to work together against all of the "lesser races.” This gam­ bit worked quite well for him, leaving him a major player in criminal enterprises on the Outer Rim. Though known to be ruthless and degenerate among those who serve him (or oppose him), Jabba the Hutt has gained great success for himself and his people through coordination and cooperation. He avoids costly conflicts with competing entities, prefer­ ring a live-and-let-live philosophy. Thus far, this has worked to keep even Black Sun out of his business, although he’s had to make a few concessions and do a few favors to maintain that delicate balance. ACTIVITIES Virtually no criminal enterprise is beyond the Hutts’ purview, and while they also maintain some legitimate businesses in the same fashion as Black Sun, there is little effort to maintain any semblance of being up­ standing members of galactic society. Whether doing honest business or expanding underworld opportuni­ ties, Hutts take an overt role in what they manage and they see each enterprise as a power play. There are very few artisans, crafters, technicians, or other creators of note or worth in Hutt society. The great­ est of their people are business moguls, brokers, and crime lords. They bring together the people and the re­ sources to fulfill a need within a given marketplace, and then they squeeze every credit they can from the opera­ tion. Nothing is respected more among their kind, and their usual ostentatious displays of decadence are meant to reinforce their images as masters of wealth and power. Controlling product flow—and taking percentages of every transaction in the process—is a major part of the revenue model for Hutt activities. In addition, a H utt’s criminal portfolio shows a great deal of effort to smuggle whatever is desired to wherever he can sell it, especially illegal items and substances. The spice trade, especially where ryll is concerned, is one of the biggest and most widespread endeavors in which the Hutts are involved. They also happily maintain a brisk slave trade; their disdain for other races makes it quite easy for them to see many species as little more than commodities with useful applications. Hutts are also well known for making revenge a kind of cultural pastime; no being can be allowed to wrong a Hutt and get away with it. Hutts tend to view any such action as diminishing to the entire species, and any Hutt that allows himself to be wronged by a lowly human or other sentient is not worthy of his position. As such, Hutts will spend exorbitant amounts tracking down and capturing anyone who deals dirty with them, or fails them in some particular way. Mere murder is not suffi­ cient; elaborate torture or some form of extreme humili­ ation is required, so that all other beings in the galaxy understand that they should never cross a Hutt. DEALING W ITH THE HUTTS Any fringer attempting to find work in the Outer Rim may ultimately have little choice but to work for a Hutt at some point. The sluglike aliens are somewhat ubiqui­ tous in most illegal activities. Starting out, most fringers may be doing jobs for a Hutt and not necessarily know it. Unlike Black Sun, however, a Hutt won’t stay hidden in the background for long; anyone who proves himself useful and resourceful will probably be called before the Hutt he’s been working for. The purpose of such a meeting will be twofold: the Hutt will want to evaluate this new potential employee for himself, possibly with an eye toward offering a more permanent position, and he will want to impress the being called before him with his power and wealth to establish dominance. How a fringer handles such a meeting will be a testa­ meant either to his savvy or his bravery, depending on his tactics. Many Hutts respond well to bravado and confi­ dence, if in varying amounts. If, however, the attitude is laid on too thick, such an interview can become ugly in a hurry. Subservience and respect are greatly appreci­ ated, but too much cravenness or toadying can result in a Hutt’s dismissing of the capabilities of the interviewed entity. In either case, the Hutt fondness for exotic, car­ nivorous beasts and elaborate death traps makes it worthwhile to ensure that the meeting goes well. Fringers can find themselves dealing with Hutts in a few ways: • Even the lowest agents of a Hutt must sometimes be brought in for questions about an operation gone wrong. Perhaps the fringers are asked to track down and bring such a person in. • The fringers may have become particularly good at something, and word has spread of their deeds. The local Hutt wants to interview them, with an eye toward bringing them on board whether they like it or not. • Keeping the locals happy can be good for busi­ ness, as any Hutt running a city or a planet knows. Perhaps his best swoop racers are in need of some fresh competition, or he needs some new fighters for his favorite combat arena. Mildly competent outsiders are a great choice for spicing things up. • This Rebellion might actually be good for busi­ ness, but no Hutt wants to get involved in actually taking sides. The fringers might be asked to make contact through back channels, perhaps arrange­ ing for the Hutt’s operation to smuggle guns and other resources to them. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS T he galaxy is vast, by most estimates containing at least 180 billion star systems. Even with only a small fraction of those systems being inhabited, there are so many different organizations, groups, clans, tribes, companies, and other factions as to be impossible to fully catalog. The farther from the Core Worlds a group of fringers travels, the more likely it will come across entirely new entities and unheard of experiences. What follows are a few of the more well-known or notable factions that fringers might have cause to en­ counter. Such encounters might mean paying work, or they might mean a desperate fight for survival. A lot depends on the fringers’ collective skill and luck. THE CORPORATE SECTOR AUTHORITY The Corporate Sector contains a mix of opportunities and danger for any fringer. A vast region in the Out­ er Rim completely controlled by mega-corporations through the Corporate Sector Authority, the Corporate Sector is largely free from Imperial control (see page 352 for more information on the Corporate Sector and its formation). However, most fringers may find the CSA as dangerous an adversary as the Empire if they cross its myriad bureaucratic and corporate policies. The CSA is a byzantine and complex entity, run entire­ ly as a standalone corporation that happens to oversee PLOOVO TW0-F0R-0NE A human crime lord based on the world of Etti IV, Ploovo Two-for-One controls a great deal of criminal and underworld activities within the Corporate Sector. Ploovo began his career as a loan shark, and was well known for sending around hired muscle to collect debts from his ''customers." Currently, Ploovo's operations go far beyond simple loan-sharking; the crime lord has expanded into running mercenaries, protection rackets, and smuggling across Corporate space— at one point. Ploovo provided funds for repairs to the Millennium Falcon. Generally, Ploovo is considered a ''mid-level" crime lord by Imperial Intelligence—he is too unwilling to get his own hands dirty and lacks a greater sense of ambition to be counted as a real threat. It is perhaps this underestimation of Ploovo’s abilities that makes him such an excellent facilitator for illegal activity. the sector in which all of the signatory companies do business. Anyone doing business in the Corporate Sec­ tor has to be very careful about the management of his affairs; he must pay the right fees, fill out the right forms, and be absolutely certain all of the minutia are covered. Even then, he finds himself at a severe disadvantage if he’s not one of the major shareholders in the CSA. The Corporate Sector's governance consists of an Executive Directorship Board of 55 executives (or Direxs) and an Executive Officer (The ExO). Senior positions also included the President (Prex), several different Vice Presidents (Viceprexes) overseeing the CSA’s various departments, and the Imperial Advisor. The CSA relies on its Security Division to enforce its rule, which they do using their feared and hated Security Police. Though the “ Espos’’ are essentially corporate security thugs, they are as well armed and equipped as a full military. They possess the ships, vehicles, and weapons they need to conduct everything from standard law enforce­ meant to full scale war. The rule of law varies at the CSA’s whims. Since those within its borders have "privileges" instead of “rights,” the law is essentially whatever the Espos need it to be (as long as their corporate masters agree). To maintain control of the Corporate Sector, the Es­ pos possess a sizable Picket Fleet of capital ships and starfighters. Many of their warships are older vessels pur­ chased at discount, such as Victory Star Destroyers and Marauder Corvettes. However, they’re more than enough to see off smugglers, pirates, and other malcontents. Many fringers see the Corporate Sector as a land of opportunity and a chance to escape the oppression of the Galactic Empire. In this they are partially correct. The CSA remains semi-autonomous from the Empire, and there are great opportunities to be had within its bor­ ders. However the CSA enforces its own oppressive rule of law that guarantees constant profits and crushes any­ one who interferes. In addition, the best opportunities remain in the hands of the CSA’s shareholder companies at the expense of the Sector’s average inhabitants. Ironically, this means that the best opportunities to be found in the Corporate Sector are on the far side of the law. Activities such as smuggling proscribed mate­ rials in or out of the region or aiding dissidents in their fight against the CSA can often pay far better than any honest work, even if they are more dangerous. Al­ ternatively, many of the megacorps who make up the CSA are willing to hire “deniable assets" to perform illegal tasks they’d rather publicly deny. THE ZANN CONSORTIUM Perhaps no criminal syndicate more effectively repre­ sents the power of an individual’s drive and charisma than the Zann Consortium. Like a warrior-king, Tyber Zann rules his criminal empire with effective strategy and ruthless commitment to success. He understands the basics of sentient nature, believing that every­ where that society of any kind exists, there are souls to corrupt and credits to be made. A one-time protege of Jabba the Hutt, Zann betrayed him and ended up in the Kessel spice mines for his trou­ ble. However, Zann escaped and leveraged his success into the construction of a powerful criminal empire. Be­ tween rapid expansions into all kinds of criminal areas and raiding Imperial caches of riches and materials, the Zann Consortium is growing into a power in the galaxy. Zann shapes his Consortium to have a more militaristic bent than many criminal organizations, and although it is nowhere near as powerful as a proper military such as the Imperial Army or Navy, it is still formidable. The Zann Consortium is widespread and powerful enough to warrant Black Sun’s attention. Prince Xizor has made overtures towards the idea of cooperation between the two groups. Zann has responded in kind, although he likely sees this as an opportunity to lull Black Sun into a false sense of security before betraying and crippling the syndicate. Since it’s high­ ly likely that Xizor has similar plans, any relationship between the two of them grows slowly at best. Like­ wise, Zann has no love for the Rebel Alliance and has worked against it on occasion. However, Zann hates the Empire and sometimes attacks its interests and installations out of spite. THE TENLOSS SYNDICATE The Tenloss Syndicate stands firmly on the line between criminal syndicate and legitimate corporate entity. The Syndicate’s conglomerate front of legitimate businesses, the Tenloss Corporation, is a collection of different com­ panies, specializing in everything from gambling to min­ ing to ship production. Meanwhile, illegal shadow opera­ tions (often within its legitimate companies) produce illicit weapons, armor, and even starships such as the Hornet Interceptor. The primary goal of the Tenloss Syndicate is to maximize profits. Whether it does so from illegal opera­ tions or legitimate sales doesn’t matter, and the focus of the group leans either way as its fortunes dictate. Though nowhere nearly as widespread as Black Sun (with which it enjoys close ties) or the Zann Consortium (Tenloss is primarily situated in the Bajic Sector), this syndicate enjoys a great deal of respect and good busi­ ness with most of the rest of the underworld commu­ nity. Additionally, there are a number of other factions, businesses, and governments who also appreciate doing business with Tenloss, especially those in need of ships and military gear they cannot otherwise acquire. As a general rule, the series of councils that oper­ ate the different levels of the Tenloss Syndicate stay focused on professional and economic goals; they are not prone to acts of passion or whim. They write off minor losses rather than expend unnecessary resources on profitless revenge. On the other hand, should anyone become a serious threat to operations, the Syndicate can bring impressive force to bear against its enemies. THE BOUNTY HUNTERS GUILD Though there are countless smaller groups, guild houses, and other organizations for bounty hunters and assassins throughout the galaxy, the vast major­ ity of real business is done through the rather massive Bounty Hunters Guild. The Guild is, in fact, made up of a number of houses and syndicates, all dedicated to a particular kind of business or a specific philosophy as dictated by the founders and leadership. The various houses, in brief, are as follows: • House Benelex, specializing in kidnapping retrieve­ also, is highly tied to the Empire and the Drearian Defense Conglomerate. THE GENOHARADAN O riginally founded by the ancient dictator Xim the Despot as a form of secret police, the GenoHaradan existed to eliminate any threat to Xim's reign. Often, this meant removing powerful rivals and enemies, but even the best efforts of the GenoHaradan could not stop the fall of Xim’s empire at the hands of the Hutts and their allies. Many scholars believe that the GenoHaradan died with their founder at the Third Battle of Von- tor, but in truth the group endured and went into hiding. Over the millennia since the fall of Xim the Despot, the GenoHaradan evolved into a secre­ tive guild of elite bounty hunters dedicated to manipulating events in the galaxy through assas­ sination. The group slowly reshaped itself from a tool of the wealthy and ambitious into a more dis­ criminating sect, recognizing that their self-inter­ est revolved around order and stability. Therefore, the GenoHaradan acted to protect and support the Galactic Republic, using the Republic's growth to enrich the lives of the GenoHaradan's mem­ bers. Many believe that the GenoHaradan may still exist during the era of the Galactic Empire. • House Neuvalis, a very young guild house by any standard, has extraordinary financial resources and works exclusively with only Imperial or corpo­ rate interests. Neuvalis only takes the high-credit bounties and guarantees their fulfillment within a year, or they return double the original fee. • House Paramexor only takes on contracts for hunt­ ing murderers. Small and full of elite hunters, Para­ mexor is also known for never taking targets alive. • House Renliss, founded by a pair of sisters with re­ puted ties to Imperial Intelligence, only employs fe­ male "huntresses'’ and only takes bounties against male acquisitions. Though considered either a nov­ elty or aberration by many in the business, the guild gets considerable business from the Empire, and the huntresses are all motivated and loyal. • House Salaktori enjoys a reputation for only hir­ ing the very best and for taking care of its own. The most prestigious and respected of the hous­ es, Salaktori is the leading guild in the galaxy. • House Tresario, founded by retired Imperial Navy officers, specializes in dealing with pirates. Their continued success with their endeavors against the pirate community has gained them greater fa­ vor and more lucrative contracts from the Empire. • The Mantis Syndicate is more of a mercenary army than an actual bounty hunting guild, though the group does take on bounties against large groups like swoop gangs and aggressive criminal guilds. The Syndicate can field companies and even bat­ talions of warriors, most of which are on retainer to Imperial Governor Jaris Affric. Due to this, the greater Guild is keeping an eye on this group. • The Ragnar Syndicate breaks nearly all of the accepted rules of the Bounty Hunters Guild. It allows members to take on extensive freelance contracts and engages in mercenary activities like counter-terrorism, assassination, and sabotage. • Skine Bounty Hunter College isn't a college at all, though savvy leaders will send their people to Skine for training when possible. Made up of a network of the very best in a huge variety of fields, Skine specializes in catching those who seem impossible to catch, and finding those who seem impossible to find Interestingly, Skine tends to avoid taking Imperial contracts, prefer­ ring to work with corporations and individuals. • The Slaver Syndicate, reviled by most of its fellow houses and groups, collects bounties on anyone who can be readily sold into slavery. Inexperi­ enced and inefficient hunters make up the bulk of the Slaver Syndicate’s ranks, and they take on the volume of low-paying bounties that other groups disdain. Murderers and brutal thugs, they are considered at best a necessary evil. If a bounty hunter does not have a history with one of these houses, he probably worked with a much smaller group, or perhaps even on his own. PIRATES Piracy is a dangerous and lucrative venture in these dark and turbulent times. While some act as priva­ teers, carrying authorization from either the Empire or the Alliance to strike at vessels belonging to the other side, many more choose to prey on whatever ships come their way. Pirates remain one of the great­ est threats to independent freighters and transports. The typical pirate operation relies on two groups. The assault group handles the ship-to-ship assault, often employing ion weaponry to knock out the pow­ er systems of the target vessel. Then the marauders connect to the target vessel, board it, and collect all the loot that can be carried away. Larger pirate op­ erations even go so far as to capture entire vessels. Crew are often pressed into service or killed, while passengers may be ransomed off or sold into slavery. Such groups often build up into full scale criminal syn­ dictates, or else sign on with such organizations if they want someone else to help manage the bigger picture. There are myriad pirate bands scattered across the galaxy. Some are groups limited to a single locale such as the Riders of the Maelstrom, who operate ex­ clusively around the Maelstrom Nebula, and the Lok Revenants, who hail from the Outer Rim world of Lok. Other groups, such as the Chorran Shipjackers, oper­ ate over larger areas. Getting involved with pirates might be a quick way to make some real money, but such activity can also ruin a fringer’s reputation if he ever wants to do legitimate business with anyone in the future. Working with such criminals also carries the risk of running afoul of a band of cutthroats and losing one’s ship or even one’s life. Becoming privateers may be a better alternative, but that means taking a side in a very bloody, difficult war. LAW AND ORDER IN THE GALAXY T here may be more laws, orders, and regulations than there are planets in the galaxy. Certainly it would be impossible to know every ordinance for every situation. Nonetheless, it’s a good idea to have at least a pass­ ing familiarity with the main laws and requirements that govern whatever work a fringer might pursue. At the very least, it’s a good idea to know what laws are being bro­ ken, and what the likely punishment will be. IMPERIAL LAW Ostensibly, the entire purpose of dissolving the Sen­ ate and instituting an Empire in place of the Old Re­ public was to wipe away corruption and chaos in favor of justice and security. With absolute authority in the form of the Emperor, and enforced by Darth Vader and the might of the Imperial military, the vast major­ ity of civilized space in the galaxy actually does enjoy a certain security and peace. What the average citizen doesn’t enjoy is per­ sonal freedom. Anything that hinders the Em­ pire’s goals is illegal, and that includes speaking out or organizing against Imperial policies. A citizen of the Empire is free enough to travel where he wishes, eat what he likes, do what he enjoys, and the like, so long as he enjoys places, food, and activities that aren’t pro­ scribed by Imperial law. In addition, to benefit from the safety and security of the Galactic Empire, the average citizen must be human. Many non-humans are treated as second-class citizens under Imperial law. The policy of Humanocentrism is embedded in the New Order philosophy of Human High Culture, and there is nothing subtle or understated about it. IMPERIAL CHARTER AND THE NEW ORDER Supreme Chancellor Palpatine initiated the New Order and all that came with it when he gave his "Declaration of a New Order” speech in front of the Galactic Senate in 19 BBY. Palpatine became the Emperor to thun­ derous applause, giving himself suoreme authority over all government and military matters, as well as justifying and legalizing the extermination of the Jedi. It would be days and even weeks before the full extent of what had transpired would start to dawn on the suddenly irrelevant Senators. It actually took almost two decades for the Senate to go from a largely ignored advisory body to non-existent. During that time, various factions struggled to regain some form of control or influence in the Imperial gov­ ernment, mostly to no avail. The Imperial Charter, while based on the previous Galactic Constitution of the Re­ public, firmly placed supreme executive power in Palpa- tine’s hands, making him the head of state, the head of government, commander-in-chief of all military forces, and the final authority on all economic matters. The only act of substance the Senate could manage involved making amendments to the Imperial Charter—however, the process for doing this was so chaotic and byzantine that it may as well not existed. In 0 BBY, with the Declaration of Rebellion, Em­ peror Palpatine finally dissolved the Imperial Sen­ ate. In its place, a pyramidal structure of Moffs and governors took the reigns of adm inistrative leader­ ship, while the Emperor and his cadre of advisors and bureaucrats handed out edicts and orders as they chose. With that, the last remnants of the Re­ public vanished. Those who wish to understand Imperial law should know a few basic principles that Palpatine outlined in his declaration. • The Jedi are elitists with dangerous powers and a desire to dominate all sentient beings. They must be exterminated and never allowed to flourish again. • Security and stability are of primary importance in the wake of the Separatist crisis and the terrible corruption at the heart of the once-great Republic. • Safety and peace for all citizens requires a new constitution, a ruling body that serves the ma­ jority, and a sovereign, enlightened ruler who re­ mains in power for life. • All beings should be ruled by one law, with one language. • A strong military is needed to protect the rights and security of all citizens. • All enemies of the Empire will be crushed and eliminated for the greater good. The essence of what the Imperial Charter promises is “Safety, security, justice, and peace." The cost of those qualities is a totalitarian regime with absolute power. CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THE EMPIRE With the utter disaster that was the legal code of the Old Republic, many feel the Justice group of COMPNOR’s Coalition for Progress actually lives up to its name and its function. Palpatine’s call for “one law” drives each member’s efforts, with the result being that most Core Worlds and connected sectors now experience a legal system uniformity not seen in many centuries. Recently, there has apparently been a move to incorporate the philosophy of “ Imperial In fallibil­ ity ” into the Empire’s legal code. The m ajority of the Justice group’s m em bership—who a tte m p t to build a just code of law—resist introducing this tenet into the legal foundation. Unfortunately, the ISB has taken up the cause and is apparently working to oust these resistant members in favor of more pliable legal minds. THE PROCURATOR OF JUSTICE The Procurator exists at the top of the Imperial criminal justice system and is responsible for pros­ ecuting cases involving highly placed political criminals and even entire planets. This is one of the people who serve the Emperor directly, report­ ing to no one else. In addition, the post is a highly protected one, served anonymously. Only the Em­ peror may overturn an edict from the Procurator, which is an unlikely occurrence. THE IMPERIAL OFFICE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (IOCI) The IOCI reports to the Justice group of COMPNOR and serves as the Empire’s central law enforcement agency. It investigates and combats criminal activi­ ties affecting Imperial concerns, mostly including multi-system criminal syndicates and similar organi­ zations. The IOCI also targets particularly nefarious individuals who have committed crimes on multiple planets or in Imperial space. By necessity, with its jurisdiction spanning the known galaxy, the IOCI frequently works in tandem with other agencies and factions. This includes Impe­ rial Intelligence, the Imperial M ilitary branches, and local agencies. The IOCI also works with the ISB and other COMPNOR agencies when called to do so. However, the ISB is far more concerned with political matters and threats, while the IOCI focuses on mat­ ters of criminal law and its enforcement. Two types of elite operatives serve the IOCI, in ad­ dition to its regular officers and investigators. First are the Sector Rangers, a body of talented and effective law enforcement officers that has existed for centu­ ries through different governments. Traditionally apo­ litical, the Sector Rangers often provide the only real source of law and order in the more distant regions of space. They tend to operate in pairs or small teams, commandeering resources and local police or militia as needed. In the current Imperial era, the Sector Rangers still serve and remain mainly independent, though COMPNOR keeps a close watch on them. Special Enforcement Officers (SEOs) are elite agents recruited prim arily from the Sector Rangers and given broad a uthority and resources to deal with the most dangerous criminals. Often working undercover and in highly dangerous circumstanc­ es, SEOs overlook any number of m inor offenses in the pursuit of a greater threat. This cavalier at­ titu de and willingness to work with almost anyone to catch the perpetrators of tru ly heinous crimes makes the Sector Rangers and SEOs popular with the citizens at large, yet does little to endear them to the ISB and other COMPNOR loyalists. Sector Rangers and SEOs have a great deal of lati­ tude when pursuing justice. This includes the ability to recruit civilians with special abilities to help with their investigation. A competent team of fringers may find themselves unexpectedly and temporarily deputized by a Sector Ranger or SEO who has need of their spe­ cialized skill set. DOING BUSINESS IN THE EMPIRE Most individuals who want to operate in the Empire must follow Imperial law, or at least understand it (if they plan to break it). For example, owning and oper­ ating starships in the Empire is regulated, and a ship owner needs to have his vessel registered. IM PERIAL REVENUE CODES Despite propaganda that touts the New Order’s commit­ meant to protecting all citizens from the criminal excesses of scoundrels and thieves, the Imperial Revenue Codes are the real purpose behind the extensive regulation of transport and interstellar trade. The Empire requires a vast treasury to operate, and trade represents the most lucrative and controllable sources of tax revenue. There are taxes for taking on salable goods, and tax­ es for delivering them to a destination. There are taxes for carrying those goods along Imperial-monitored hy­ perspace lanes, as well as for crossing sectors. In fact, if a freighter captain doesn’t figure out how to generate enough revenue over and above all of the tariffs and fees, he’ll be bankrupt within a couple of months of flying. Even worse, the Imperial Revenue Codes places the burden of proof on the individual citizen. If a cus­ toms agent or other Imperial representative calls for proof of tax payments being up to date and a citizen cannot provide adequate documentation, he is in seri­ ous trouble. Penalties can include confiscation of the goods being carried, impounding of the ship, and even being banished to a labor camp for years. There is very little wonder that, as dangerous as it is, smuggling is a popular alternative for the ship cap­ tains brave enough to dare it. THE BUREAU OF SHIPS A ND SERVICES (BOSS) Possibly the most independently powerful civil agen­ cy in the Empire, the Bureau of Ships and Services may be over 18,000 years old. Every major space­ port has a branch office, and virtually no one who flies anywhere within galactic space dares operate outside the Bureau’s authority. Even the Empire does not dare to interfere with BoSS in any significant way, instead choosing to require its own related offices to coordi­ nate with the Bureau as necessary. This unprecedented power comes from the im­ mense data, collected over hundreds of millennia, detailing all of the astrogation information of the known galaxy. The BoSS maintains records of all of the hyperlanes, stellar phenomena, and anything else related to going from one point to another in the gal­ axy, and every other agency needing this information relies on the Bureau to get it. Additionally, the BoSS maintains records for every ship and every captain, including registrations, certi­ fications, ship statistics, transponder codes, weapons and shields, and last upgrades or overhauls. The BoSS assigns transponder codes for ships, and a ship’s cap­ tain must maintain his BoSS datapad at all times. This datapad contains the latest information on his ship, his crew, his travel data and location, and his current certi­ fications—all of which the BoSS has on record. The Bu­ reau regularly transmits the relevant and current data out to spaceports, Imperial administrative offices, and enforcement agencies. In particular, the BoSS coordi­ nates directly with the Imperial Space Ministry. The Bureau handles its own structure and person­ nel; most positions are actually hereditary in nature, or else the current holder cultivates and trains his replacement. As such, it’s both a civil service and a kind of clan. The vital nature of the Bureau's service, and the assurance that no other entity could possibly manage the data it has, makes its neutrality a de facto reality that everyone, even the Emperor, accepts. THE IM PERIAL SPACE M IN ISTR Y Despite the role and importance of the BoSS, the Em­ peror’s New Order demands a certain level of involve­ meant and control over starships and travel, and that’s where the Imperial Space Ministry comes in. The trav­ el and astrogation data collected by BoSS goes into constantly updated bulletins transmitted by the Min­ istry. These bulletins also include information about the latest rules and regulations, as well as information for spacers and other interested citizens about op­ portunities to work with the Empire. The Ministry also monitors BoSS data and other factions to spot trends in piracy, smuggling, or other spaceborn crime. The Ministry also updates and publishes the Spac­ er’s Information Manual, which among other things details the Imperial Penal References. More commonly called the "ImpPeRe” by the average spacer, the Im­ perial Penal References break down into five classes. Though galactic law, the Imperial Revenue Codes, and countless other sources may make the ordinances gov­ erning galactic travel almost dizzying to contemplate, most spacers still know the broad five categories: • Class Five: Minor infractions, these often result in either small fines or a tiny bribe to look the other way. These include transgressions against local im- port/export laws or failing to have the proper emer­ gency equipment. Fines can go as high as 1,000 credits, though most are much smaller (or can be lowered by paying part of the difference directly to the official in question). Evidence of Alliance con­ nections can elevate this transgression into impris­ onment quickly. Class Fives are also called "Quints.” • Class Four: The next category up involves infrac­ tions such as transporting common spice, low-level tax evasion, long-expired licenses, or carrying low- grade contraband materials without permits. The fines for these infractions can go as high as 5,000 credits. A spacer needs a “Quad” or two on his record before the typical Corellian even considers him a real smuggler. Note that spice runners may find themselves in much deeper trouble if inter­ dicted by Imperial Navy enforcers. • Class Three: Mandatory impounding of the ship and confiscation of all goods typically goes with this grade of transgression. This includes bribery of an Imperial official or non-permitted transport of high-end contraband, regulated technology, and upper-level narcotics. While it’s possible to stay out of prison, the costs and fines are likely to run as high as 10,000 credits. Worse, getting a "Trip" off of a permanent record requires either a very skilled slicer or a risky bribe to the right official. • Class Two: Anyone caught transporting truly re­ stricted technology, especially armaments and supplies of war, faces a “Deuce” if caught. This is doubly true if the ship actually mounts illegal armaments as well. The captain and crew face im­ mediate arrest and a confiscated starship. They face at least a 10,000 credit fine, along with 5-30 years in prison. Lesser connections to either pi­ racy or the Rebellion may also result in a Class Two infraction, with possibly even harsher results. • Class One: Truly capital offenses, such as overt pi­ racy, firing on other spacers or Imperial assets, or possession of the highest order of restricted tech­ nology fall under the “Ace” class of criminal offense. Any substantiated connection to the Alliance or other conspiracy against the Empire is also a Class One offense. If they are lucky, Class One offenders get a few decades to life in a penal colony or the Kessel spice mines. More likely, they face execution. SECTOR, ZONE, AND PLANETARY LAW History, cultural influence, stellar phenomena—all of these factors and more can result in unique laws and regulations for a given sector or planet. In that igno­ rance of a law is seldom a viable defense when break­ ing it, wise spacers and fringers will do the research before entering a new sector for the first time. GENERAL INFORMATION Any traveler landing on a planet for the first time should concern himself with two key legal issues. The first is to what extent Imperial law is enforced in the sector. The second, naturally, is whether there are any unique local ordinances with harsh penalties attached. In the first instance, some conjecture can be made based on the proximity to the Core Worlds and the strategic or economic importance of the sector or planet in question. Imperial law enforcement may be dominant and oppressive in a Core sector, with extensive Navy patrols and countless Customs frig­ ates. More remote sectors usually have a smaller, less constant Imperial presence. In addition, the kinds of officers and officials found in the far sectors are less ambitious and capable than their fellows in the Core. A savvy traveler in such a sector may find it fairly easy to avoid Imperial officials, and to bribe his way out of the few such meetings he might have. Few sectors have specific laws that apply only to the planets and space they encompass, and if they do, such laws tend to focus on elements that are unique to that sector. For example, traditions and customs may absolutely forbid slavery on the key planets of the sector, and the Empire has taken no steps to alter this stance. As such, even though slavery is legal in many Imperial sectors, local officials may still investigate and prosecute anyone involved directly in the slave trade. Stellar or cosmic phenomena may be another source of sector-wide laws. For example, there may be an asteroid belt containing rich deposits of high valuable resources. As the main source of the sector’s wealth, there are bound to be specific laws regard­ ing travel to and within the belt, as well as conduct­ ing any kind of business or operation therein. Due to the impact the field has on local travel, there may be regulations intended to improve safety; ignoring these regulations could carry a heavy fine, if for no other reason than local mining operations are at great risk if anyone comes crashing through their facilities. SECTOR LAW EXAMPLE-THE CSA The Corporate Sector Authority is a prime example of a sector with its own specific laws and ordinances. The specific nature of the CSA eliminates Imperial oversight and law in favor of its own regulations and legal system. Anyone entering the Corporate Sector legally receives information on CSA laws. These are similar to the Imp- PeRe, yet modified to the Authority’s mercantile nature. It is important to note that in a capitalistic society like the CSA, these laws can be circumvented by the right amount of money. For example, purchasing a CSA Waiv­ er for a hefty sum can allow a captain to carry normally illegal armaments or other systems on his ship. • Class D: These minor infractions include contribut­ ing to disorderly conduct during a work shift, being late for a work shift, unsafe or inappropriate behav­ ior while on the clock, and acting with disrespect toward CSA officials or policies. Even these minor infractions allow for imprisonment in a labor camp for one month to one year. Violators can also suffer demotion and lose up to three months’ salary. • Class C: Infractions at this class include vandalism of Authority property, possession of illegal weap­ owns, chronic lateness or dereliction of duty (in other words, being a bad employee), and acts of slander or libel against CSA officials or programs. A violator faces fines equal to up to six months’ salary, demotion, and possibly imprisonment in a labor colony from three months to five years. • Class B: These are lesser infractions, yet still se­ rious. Infractions of this class include embezzle­ meant of less than 10,000 credits, conspiracy against the Authority, credit fraud, misuse of CSA copyrights and registered symbols, and trans­ porting illegal weapons and high level contraband within the sector. Consequences include five to twenty years assignment to a labor colony and fines equivalent to one to three years' salary. • Class A: These are the worst infractions, resulting in either permanent exile from the sector or (more likely) life assignment to a labor colony. Execution is not out of the question. Such infractions include industrial sabotage, embezzlement greater than 10,000 credits, willful destruction of CSA property, terrorism and piracy, conspiring to form a union, and violation of Authority ship weapons laws. PLANETARY LAW EXAMPLE-ELROOD Located in the Outer Rim, Elrood is nonetheless a highly civilized and developed planet, and capital of the Elrood Sector. Elrood is also the manufacturing and primary trade center for the sector, ensuring its importance and wealth. Despite these factors, the en­ tire sector is patrolled by only two Imperial Star De­ stroyers and a small fleet of other ships. While abiding by most Imperial laws, Elrood’s star- ports fall under the administration of the Elrood Starport Command (ESC). This means spaceport security forces focus on local laws and regulations. Ships with less than Class 1 or Class 2 infractions posted on their records stand a good chance of avoiding any issues when land­ ing at an Elrood starport. It also helps that the ESC isn’t directly tied to Imperial databases, though it does re­ ceive regular updates from the Imperial Space Ministry. However, Elrood authorities enforce Imperial stan­ dards for starships rather vigorously, mostly in the interest of protecting their atmosphere, space ways, and general travel within the sector. Problems with a ship’s performance are likely to guarantee notifica­ tions and even fines from the ESC to force the way­ ward captain to abide by regulations. Elrood has a number of regulations, fees, customs, and laws that all travelers should become familiar with as soon as possible. The following is a good example of what those visiting Elrood and many other civilized plan­ ets in the Outer Rim can expect: • Basic landing fees are calculated at ten credits per ten meters of the ship’s length. Decontamina­ tion fees are included. Berthing is 10% of this fee per day at most locations. Customs takes a fee of 1 % value of all cargo delivered or taken aboard. • Discrepancies from the ship’s manifest accrue a fine equal to 20% of the missing value. • Departures from the starport must be applied for with the ESC, at which time it assigns a specific departure schedule and path. • Ships are forbidden to use weapons planetside or within the system, with serious fines (or ship impoundment) and imprisonment as the penalty. • All sentient beings pay a five credit visitation fee; there are no fees for droids. • Contraband cargo is defined as weapons and armor, non-indigenous animal species, spice and non-medical narcotics, and regulated ores. Permits may be purchased on arrival for certain types of recreational spice, exotic fauna, and regulated ore. These permits cost ten credits, but if the individual plans to trade these substances, they must also pay a tariff equal to 5% of the substances’ total value. • The official language of Elrood is Basic. • Ranged weapons are restricted on the planet, as are melee weapons exceeding 10 cm in length. To carry any restricted weapon requires a 50 credit permit and the weapon must be prominently dis­ played at all times. Permits are not available for military weapons such as blaster carbines or rifles, light repeating blasters, and two-handed melee weapons. Personal armor is strictly prohibited. • All droids are required to be fitted with restrain­ ing bolts. Elrood does recognize and except man­ umitted droids from this law, so long as they can provide documentation. • Civilized and reasonable behavior is expected at all times, and violators face stiff fines and either expulsion from the planet or imprisonment for violations. Violence, smuggling, theft, and selling contraband all result in very serious law enforce­ meant measures on the behalf of Elrood police and security forces. OUTSIDE THE LAW If smugglers, spacers, or other citizens wish to deal in questionable merchandise or purchase restricted items, they are not likely to be able to do so legally. However, there are organizations beyond the law that fringers can use to traffic in merchandise. The most prominent of these is the black market. THE BLACK MARKET It is important to realize the black market is not a single, homogeneous entity. Rather, it refers to myriad different networks and dealers scattered across countless civilized worlds. Black markets are vague and loosely connected networks that secretly deal in regulated or illegal goods and services, like an invisible spiderweb covering civilized society. One of the most difficult things a spacer can at­ tempt is landing on a new world and making contact with someone involved in the local black market. Cautious inquiries, clandestine meetings, and careful negotiations are all necessary. One wrong move or ill-spoken word can result in a firefight, a back alley beating, or arrest. Once an individual makes multiple reliable contacts, dealing in the black market becomes much easier. This applies whether someone is trying to sell or obtain items or services on the black market, no matter what those items or services may be. If a contact cannot provide a service or buy or sell an item, they may know someone amongst their own list of contacts who can (possibly for a small referral fee). This may repeat multiple times un­ til the person locates the right contact. Success in the black market depends on two things: how many people someone knows, and who those people are. Since black market networks are usually dealing in illicit or restricted items, any negotiations are always overshad­ owed by the threat of discovery by the authorities. This is another reason why having more contacts in a black mar­ ket is useful. Contacts may be caught by the authorities, or forced into hiding. Always remember that black market networks are never stable, and more contacts means re­ dundancies that can survive that instability. Certain skills and talents are vital to successfully navi­ gating a black market, no matter where it is. Having someone with good street instincts is vital, as most crimi­ nal operations tend to share some simi­ larities everywhere in the galaxy, as is being a smooth talker when conducting negotiations. Mercantile sense is also very useful; black market dealings may be illegal, but they are still commercial transactions. Finally, having someone threatening and dangerous to provide backup and discourage betrayal is also useful, since black mar­ kets are not bound by conventional laws. Black market work doesn’t always mean buying, transporting, and selling morally questionable nar­ cotics, weapons, or technology. There are places in the galaxy in desperate need of food, medicines, and basic supplies. The people there cannot afford to pay the fees and taxes imposed by the Empire, or else the Empire has cut them off from basic supplies as a means of punishment. Thus, black market opera­ tives may find themselves in the conundrum of being legally wrong, but morally right. THE REBELLION With the entire might of the Empire turned toward its destruction, the Rebel Alliance’s survival is miraculous. There is no worse crime in the Empire’s eyes than be­ ing part of the Rebellion, and this means it’s cut off from many legal avenues of supply. Thus, the organiza­ tion that arguably has the greatest need for goods and services in the galaxy has a very hard time filling that need, and often turns to illegal avenues of supply. This can provide a valuable opportunity for smug­ glers and other independent freighter captains. Small transport ships, able to transport goods, materials, weapons, medicines, and important personnel any­ where required, are essential to the Alliance. What a tramp freighter lacks in bulk cargo capacity, it more than makes up for in flexibility and stealth. Smugglers tend to know the best routes to use when they want to avoid Imperial Customs or Naval interdiction, and fringers tend to make a life out of breaking the law. However, many see the risks as outweighing the opportunities. Dealing with the Alliance is the worst offense in the Empire’s eyes, and likely earns the of­ fender a quick death or a life sentence in Kessel’s spice mines. What’s more, the Alliance doesn’t always have much money to offer. Limited funds may be supplemented by appeals to a smuggler’s goodwill or offers of barter. This isn’t always a bad thing; what the Rebellion lacks in funding, it more than makes up for in talent and im­ provised resources. A savvy fringer willing to work with what’s available might be able to arrange for a complete overhaul of his ship’s engines, military-grade hardware, or illegal weapons. Perhaps a Rebel slicer can access some sector records and remove a few blemishes on a person’s registration, or Alliance raids can obtain supplies they’ll trade to fringers. ADVERSARIES T he galaxy is an almost incomprehensibly vast place, with more variety than any one being can hope to experience and appreciate during a lifetime. There are thousands upon thousands of inhabitable worlds, filled with hundreds of thousands of intelligent spe­ cies of every imaginable shape and size. If there is any portion of the galaxy that is free from conflict, how­ ever, no one has yet discovered it. No m atter what manner of being takes to the stars in search of adventure, profit, or escape, there are always obstacles to be overcome and, in a great many cases, those obstacles take the form of ene­ mies who seek to bar the adventurer’s path for one reason or another. There are three different levels of opponents that characters will readily encounter in the galaxy, with different levels of threat posed to the average group of scoundrels .and rogues. Although some variation is to be expected, the broad categories include minions, rivals, and nemeses. • “Bounty hunters. We don't need their scum." -A d m ira l P ie tt M INIO NS Minions are the most common NPCs encountered in the Star Wars universe. These are nameless in­ dividuals who provide muscle to flesh out encoun­ ters. Their only real threat is in numbers, and a minion is not expected to stand toe-to-toe with a Player Character. .Minions are typically not real threats when encoun­ tered alone. Unfortunately, they are almost never en­ countered alone, but instead tend to operate in small groups to increase their effectiveness. Minions will rarely be more than a minor obstacle to most par­ ties of characters, a delaying tactic that can stand in the way of achieving a goal that a more powerful' enemy wishes to see prevented. Minions also have lower wound thresholds.than other NPCs, making it very likely they’ll drop in one or two hits. CMs can use minions as adversaries either as individu­ also or in groups. However, unless the minion has relevant characteristics of three or higher, individual minions are more likely to fail than succeed on all but the simplest combat checks. CMs should only do this if they wish to pit their characters against an easy combat challenge. The more typical way to use minions involves deploying them in groups, as described later in this section. MINION RULES Minions have several unique rules that reflect their status as disposable adversaries. • Unless otherwise specified, minions do not suf­ fer strain. Anything that inflicts strain on a minion inflicts wounds instead. They also cannot voluntarily suffer strain. This means that when a minion is taken out of combat due to exceeding his wound thresh­ old, it is up to the GM whether he was incapacitated or killed, depending on the circumstances. • Minions do not possess ranks in skills. One thing that makes minions significantly weaker than Player Characters is their lack of ranks in skills. They can compensate for this by operating as a group. A minion’s profile lists several skills in which they can gain ranks when acting in a group. • Minions can fight as a group. As noted previ­ ously, the GM does not have to deploy minions in groups. However, deploying them in a group has several advantages. It simplifies combats and makes minions more dangerous while allowing GMs to include large numbers of adversaries. Minions are only deployed in groups of the same type. The minion group has a single wound threshold, shared by all members of the group. This wound thresh­ old is equal to the sum of the wound threshold of every member of the group. (For example, a group of 3 stormtroopers—each with a wound threshold of 5—has a wound threshold of 15.) Each time any member of the group suffers wounds, the wounds are applied to the group’s wound threshold. Indi­ vidual members of the group are defeated one at a time, each time the total wounds suffered exceeds that group member’s share of the wound threshold. For example, when the stormtrooper group passes 5 wounds, one stormtrooper is defeated. When characters attack a group, they attack the group as a whole, not an individual. Likewise, minions make one attack per group, not per individual. Working as a group allows minions to use skills. A minion group gains one skill rank for each member of the group beyond the first, if that skill is on the minion’s list. So, a group of four stormtroopers would count as having three ranks (for the three troopers after the first) in any checks the group is called on to make. • Minions are killed by Critical Injuries. If a minion suffers a Critical Injury, it is immediately incapaci­ tated. If a group of minions suffers a Critical Injury, it suffers one minion’s worth of wounds (so that one of the minions in the group is incapacitated). RIVALS Rivals are more dangerous than minions but still infe­ rior to most Player Characters. Rivals are very similar to Player Characters in many respects, being general­ ly more innately gifted and well trained than minions. They possess skills and operate individually rather than in groups. They are generally less skilled than the PCs, however, seldom possessing more than two ranks in any one skill. RIVALS RULES Rivals follow most of the same rules as Player Charac­ ters do, except as noted here. • Rivals suffer Critical Injuries normally. Howev­ er, when a rival exceeds his wound threshold, he can be killed outright (instead of incapacitated) at the CM’s discretion. • Rivals cannot suffer strain. When a rival would suffer strain, he suffers an equivalent number of wounds instead. He can, however, use abilities or invoke effects that would cause him to suffer strain; this simply causes him to suffer wounds instead. Remember, because he does not suffer strain, he cannot recover it either. Like minions, if a rival is in­ capacitated, the GM can decree if he was killed or rendered unconscious based on the circumstances. CMs can decide to track strain on certain rivals, even though this is not the norm. This does cre­ ate extra bookkeeping for the CM but also allows some additional granularity for rivals that might prove im portant to the plot. In essence, this allows the GM to create Nemesis class characters with weaker than average statistics. NEMESES The nemesis is the opposite of the Player Character. They are identical to them in virtually every respect and may in fact be more powerful; this is necessary to ensure that they are able to pose a threat to an entire party. Nemeses frequently possess a number of talents, high characteristics, and skills, and their equipment can often rival that of even the most well supplied parties. Nemeses suffer strain and wounds normally and do not have any special rules govern­ ing their operations. ADVERSARY LIST T he following is a list of adversaries the CM can use in his adventures. These adversaries are divided into several groups, depending on their affiliations and motives. Each adversary's profile is also broken down into several discrete sections. • Name: The adversary’s name or type, plus whether it is a minion, rival, or nemesis. • Description: A section describing the adversary. • Characteristics: The rating of the adversary’s six basic characteristics. • Skills: Skills (if any) possessed by the adversary. If the adversary is a minion, these skills only ap­ ply in a group. • Talents: Talents (if any) possessed by the adversary. • Soak/Defense and Thresholds: These are the adversary’s soak, his defense (listed in both me­ lee and ranged values), and his wound and strain thresholds. Only nemeses have listed strain thresholds. If a CM wishes to give a rival a strain threshold, it should have the same value as the listed wound threshold. • Abilities: These are special abilities that are not skills or talents. • Equipment: This is the adversary’s equipment. The entry only lists important equipment such as weap­ owns, armor, and vital pieces of gear. Items such as clothing, comlinks, spare change, glow-rods, and so forth are not listed but are still present if it makes sense (and at the GM’s discretion). Any bonuses from equipment are already added to the profile. It is important to note that adversaries do not al­ ways follow the same rules that player characters do. These profiles are generated for simplicity and ease of use, so non-essential information can be omitted. For example, the Barabel enforcer has a soak higher than his Brawn, even though he does not wear armor. This is due to the Barabels’ notoriously thick hide— however this is not indicated by a unique rule. The higher soak value is sufficient. GALACTIC UNDERWORLD The galaxy is a vast and luminous place, but for ev­ ery light there lurks a shadow. The mere existence of civilization and galactic government gives rise to those who eschew its values and laws, and instead seek to profit from activities that are prohibited by those who sit in power. On some planets, the criminal under­ world is cautious, moving silently and congregating only in the most secret of places. On other worlds, however, it operates brazenly and in the open, wield­ ing its power and influence like a blunt instrument and daring the forces of law and order to oppose it. AQUALISH THUG [MINION] Slightly more intelligent and more likely to use ad­ vanced technology than the Camorrean enforcers that are popular with many crime lords, Aqualish are no less physically powerful than their porcine counterparts and equally prone to violence as a means of resolving even the mildest dispute. Although not all members of the Aqualish people are crude and thuggish, enough of them are that the sight of them acting as enforcers and henchmen for all manner of unpleasant figures is hard­ ly surprising to any well traveled citizen of the galaxy’s seedy underbelly. Skills (groups only): Brawl, Coercion, Melee, Ranged (Light). Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), brass knuckles (Brawl; Damage 4; Critical 4; Range: En­ gaged; Disorient 3). ARMS DEALER [RIVAL] Some say that conflict is the lifeblood of the galaxy and there are always those who will find a means of profiting from any endeavor, no matter how unpleasant. Arms dealers have access to large amounts of weaponry and are willing to sell them to anyone, for a price. The means by which these individuals come by their stock varies wildly; some are former mercenaries, while others haunt battlefields like scavengers looking for cast-aside weap­ owns instead of a meal, and still others have extensive networks of contacts within existing military organiza­ tions. Regardless, these individuals are often in the mar­ ket for smugglers or others who have ships of their own to transport goods to and from customers. Due to the sheer volume of firepower they have available to bring to bear if the situation requires it, it is an extremely bad idea to cross an arms dealer. Skills: Negotiation 1, Ranged (Heavy) 2, Ranged (Light) 2, Vigilance 1. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Heavy blaster pistol (Ranged [Light); Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium); Stun setting), vibroknife (Melee; Damage 3; Critical 3; Range [En­ gaged); Pierce 2, Vicious 1). BARABEL ENFORCER [RIVAL] A step up from a simple thug, an enforcer is a bit more trained and intelligent in the application of brute force. To avoid excessive expense in training such individuals, as well as to inspire fear in those they need intimidat­ ed, criminal figures tend to look for imposing beings with significant physical might to fill these slots. Gamor- reans are common, of course, as are Aqualish and Wookiees, but Barabels are particularly feared because their reptilian appearance inspires a deep, primal fear in many mammali­ an species. Barabels are an intelligent species, but often seem otherwise be­ cause of their halting command of Basic and their seemingly primitive social cus­ toms. Their physical strength is prodi­ gious, however, and they also enjoy a significant amount of natural armor that protects them from many threats, making them ideal enforcers to send into danger­ ous situations. melee weapons, but just as many choose to rely upon their natural weapons, either teeth or claws. Skills: Brawl 3, Cool 2, Coordination 2, Melee 3, Ranged (Light) 2, Stealth 3, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 3 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target three times), Deadly Accu­ racy (adds his ranks in Brawl to all damage inflicted with claws), Lethal Blows 2 (adds + 2 0 to Critical In­ jury rolls against opponents). Abilities: Light-Sensitive (Defel are vulnerable to bright lights, which cause them intense pain and temporary blindness if viewed without protection. A Defel exposed to bright light without protective goggles suffers two Set­ back dice on all skill checks.), Shad­ owed (Defel possess the ability to absorb certain wavelengths of light, making them all but invis­ ible in darkness. When in dark­ ness or deep shadow, a Defel gains two Boost dice to all Stealth checks.). Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), claws (Brawl; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Engaged]). Skills: Ranged (Heavy) 1, Melee 2, Perception 1, Survival 2, Vigilance I . Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster carbine (Ranged [Heavy]; Dam­ age 9; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), combat knife (Melee; Damage 5; Critical 3; Range [Engaged]). DEFEL ASSASSIN [NEMESIS] Murder for hire is a thriving business in galactic so­ ciety and those who need the utmost in discretion or who require the death of a particularly cautious or protected target choose to pay for a Defel assassin. The Defel are bestial in appear­ ance, and are consummate hunters and predators. They are masters of infiltration, stealth, and sudden bouts of vicious but silent violence. Many choose to train in a variety of A government that spans an entire galaxy is, by its very nature, bureaucratic. Bureaucracy means pa­ perwork and paperwork means there will always be those who need certain documents to which they do not have access. Forgers provide such things, but at a cost. "Paperwork” is something of a misno­ mer, however, because other than some more iso­ lated planetary governments, very few agencies re­ quire physical paperwork, instead issuing and requiring electronic documents in the form of se­ cure datapads or encrypted files. A typical forger, then, works almost exclusively in the realm of elec­ tronic fabrication, and many are extremely skilled at their jobs. Those who are not are quickly weeded out by exposing themselves through shoddy work. F O R G E R [R IV A L ] Skills: Computers 1, Knowledge (Underworld) 2, Per­ ception 2, Skulduggery 2, Vigilance 1. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Holdout blaster (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Stun setting), electronic forger’s kit and tools. INFOCHANT [RIVAL] In a galactic society, and even more so in its criminal underbelly, information is perhaps the most valuable commodity in existence. An infochant, shorthand slang for "information merchant,” traffics in information and makes it available to anyone who wants it for a price. Typically, an infochant has a network of people who feed him information in exchange for favors, payment, or even other information (which the infochant spreads to those who may be interested). Some must seek out potential clients but others let the clients come to them. This is generally the hallmark of an infochant who has established a well known, successful, and prof­ itable network. Skills: Deception 2, Knowledge (All) 2, Perception 2, Vigilance 1. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Holdout blaster (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Stun setting), encrypted datapad, comlink. There will always be those in need of money in the gal­ axy and there will always be others who are happy to lend it to them in exchange for a promise of repayment plus interest. Loan sharks are typically individuals with significant wealth at their disposal but who are never content with what they have. This leads them to loan their money to others at such a rate that they get back at least half again what was loaned. The people to whom they loan their money are desperate and have nowhere else to turn, but loan sharks care little about the details. They simply want their money returned or they want to see those who default on their loans pun­ ished in the most demonstrative way possible. LO A N S H A R K [N E M E S I S ] Skills: Charm 2, Coercion 2, Cool 2, Deception 4, Ranged (Light) 2, Perception 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary I (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once), Natural Negotiator (once per session, may reroll any Cool or Negotiation check), Spare Clip (does not run out of ammo on a ^>). Abilities: None. Equipment: Disruptor pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 10; Critical 2; Range [Short], Vicious 4), holdout blaster (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Stun setting), armored clothing (+1 soak, +1 defense). PIRATE CREW [MINION] The sort of beings who embrace the life of a pirate are typically those who simply could not fit into society in any other situation. Pirates are selfish, bloodthirsty indi­ viduals who thrive on the thrill of combat and the cruel joy of victimizing others. These people live with the ever­ present threat of death; when boarding another vessel or if attacked by law enforcement agencies. Because of this ever-present threat of death, pirates tend to embrace a hedonistic lifestyle that includes revelry at every imagine­ able opportunity and of every conceivable variety. Skills (groups only): Cool, Ranged (Heavy) or Ranged (Light). Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Heavy blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting) or blaster carbine (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 9; Criti­ cal 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), vibroknife (Me­ lee; Damage 3; Critical 2; Range [Engaged]; Pierce 2, Vicious 1), padded armor ( + 2 soak). Among the rank and file of pirate crews, some small handfuls survive long enough to hone their skills and become leaders among their fellows. These in­ dividuals possess a cunning that their comrades lack and have honed it to a razor’s edge over the course of their time spent as a crewman. The ideol­ ogy of these individuals varies, from those who slaughter every victim to eliminate witnesses to those who display mercy in the hopes that future victims will be more willing to surrender. Most pi­ rate captains fear capture and will not take unnec­ essary risks unless the promise of reward is so great that their avarice overcomes their caution. P IR A T E C A PT A IN [N E M E S I S ] The most abominable sort of criminal, slavers profit by robbing others of their freedom. Slavers prey upon the weak or those who cannot fight against modern technology, often locating a primitive species some­ where in the galaxy then abducting entire villages of their victims. These unfortunates can be sold off as cheap physical labor. Some advanced species are made the targets of slavery as a means of controlling a problematic population, as with the Empire's en­ dorsement of placing the fiercely independent and physically powerful Wookiee race into slavery. S L A V E R [R IV A L ] Skills: Coercion 3, Cool 3, Coordination 2, Deception 3, Gunnery 2, Leadership 2, Ranged (Heavy) 3, Melee 4, Resilience 2, Skulduggery 3. Talents: Adversary 2 (upgrade difficulty of all com­ bat checks against this target twice), Feral Strength 2 ( + 2 damage on all Brawl and Melee attacks), Knockdown (may spend <& to knock target prone with successful melee attack). Abilities: Pirate Leader (may spend a ma­ neuver giving orders to other pirate allies in medium range, granting them □ on their next check). Equipment: Heavy blaster rifle (Ranged (Heavy); Damage 10; Critical 3; Range (Long); Auto­ fire, Cumbersome 3), vibro-ax (Melee; Damage 9; Critical 2; Range [Engaged]; Pierce 2, Sun­ der, Vicious 3), armored clothing (+ 1 soak, + 1 defense). Skills: Coercion 2, Melee 2, Ranged (Light) 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Battered stun pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 7; Critical Range [Short]; Stun damage), net (Ranged [Light]; Damage 2; Critical - ; Range [Short]; Ensnare 3; Knockdown, Limited Ammo 1), truncheon (Melee; Damage 5; Critical 5; Range [En­ gaged]; Disorient 2). SHIPJACKER [RIVAL] A terror that haunts the shadows of a major spaceport, a shipjacker is a thief who specializes in stealing and quickly reselling starships. An expert at circum­ venting electronic security of all forms, a successful shipjacker is also intimately familiar with the proto­ cols and procedures of whatever spaceports he chooses to prey upon. Likewise, most shipjack- ers have close relationships with expert forgers to ensure that the documentation re- quired to remove a vessel from the spaceport can be quickly and convincingly acquired. Most shipjackers have a network of contacts to ensure that a starship, once stolen, can be quickly sold and moved to a dis­ tant part of the galaxy or, failing that, dismantled for parts and sold in a dozen different locations in as many different systems. Skills: Computers 1, Deception 2, Piloting (Space) 2, Skulduggery 2, Stealth 2, Vigilance 1. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: None. Equipment: Heavy blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium], Stun setting), 2 stun gre­ nades (Ranged [Light]; Damage 8; Critical - ; Range [Short]; Blast 8, Disorient 3, Limited Ammo 1, Stun Damage), elec­ tronic lock breaker. SLICER [RIVAL] The electronic information systems that allow galactic society to function are complex and intricate. They are secured against outside intrusion in order to allow civilization to function in a manner that grants indi­ viduals who can afford it some modicum of privacy. A slicer is an expert at circumventing that privacy and allowing outside parties access to whatever informa­ tion they desire, as long as the money is good. Skills: Computers 2, Cool 2, Skulduggery 1. Talents: Bypass Security (remove ■ from any Com­ puters or Skulduggery check to bypass security). Abilities: None. Equipment: Stun blaster (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical - ; Range [Short]; Stun Damage), slicergear. SMUGGLER BARON [NEMESIS] Some smugglers not only survive in the industry long enough to retire, but prosper beyond their ex­ pectations. Some of them find the notion of retire­ meant too boring to contem plate and instead de­ cide to become something of a middleman, helping other smugglers connect with clients and individu­ also who need goods moved from one place to an­ other w ithout any troublesom e questions. These men and women are sometimes called smuggler barons, a fittin g title given the aristocratic airs some of them put on. Smuggler barons are not quite powerful enough to be considered crime lords in their own right, but can be powerful allies or inconvenient enemies. Skills: Astrogation 3, Charm 2, Cool 3, Gunnery 3, Knowledge (Underworld) 3, Ranged (Light) 3, Pilot­ ing (Planetary) 3, Piloting (Space) 4, Skulduggery 2, Streetwise 4, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once), Master Pilot (once per round, suffer two strain to perform one Pilot ac­ tion as a maneuver), Skilled Jockey 2 (remove ■ ■ from all Pilot checks). Abilities: None. Equipment: Heavy blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), armored clothing (+1 defense, +1 soak), YT-2400 Freighter (see page 265). Many smugglers started out as legitimate business­ men but, for whatever reason (either an inability to make an honest living or a moral fluidity that lent it­ self to illegitimate jobs), migrated to the lucrative but dangerous profession of smuggling illegal cargoes across the galaxy. Smugglers are a hardy, indepen­ dent breed, frequently thrill-seekers who enjoy flout­ ing the law and accomplishing acts others tell them cannot be completed. S M U G G L E R [R IV A L ] Skills: Charm 2, Cool 1, Ranged (Light) 2, Piloting (Space) 3, Skulduggery 2, Streetwise 2, Vigilance 1. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once), Skilled Jockey 2 (re­ move up to ■ ■ from any Piloting check). Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting). STREET TOUGH [MINION] In cities across the galaxy there are any number of petty criminals, from pickpockets and back-ally spice dealers to muggers and murderers. Discontent with the notion of earning an honest wage, these street toughs instead prefer to survive on whatever they can take from passers-by, preferably in the form of credits or small, easily liquidated electronic goods like data- pads and comlinks. Street toughs occasionally work as individuals, if they possess sufficient skill, but more often work in small gangs so that they can coopera­ tively locate and target the best marks. However, these individuals are often badly equipped and pitiful in comparison to real gangs. Skills (group only): Melee, Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy), Skulduggery. Talents: None Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun Setting) or slugth- rower rifle (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 7; Critical 5; Range [Medium]; Cumbersome 2), Truncheon (Melee; Damage 5; Critical 5; Range [Engaged], Disorient 2), heavy clothing (+ 1 soak). There are always those who love to fly, but are unwill­ ing or unable to accept the rigid discipline and strict protocols of consistent flying for the military or for a corporation. Many become pilots-for-hire, selling their considerable skills to anyone willing to pay them to do what they love: climbing into the cockpit of a starship and taking to the hyperlanes. Sullustans of­ ten fall into this category. These short humanoids evolved in underground conditions and have an in­ nate pathfinding ability as well as extremely sensitive sensory organs. Many use these abilities to become skilled navigators or talented starship pilots. S U L L U S T A N P IL O T -F O R -H IR E [R IV A L ] Skills: Astrogation 4, Cool 1, Gunnery 2, Ranged (Light) 1, Perception 5, Piloting (Planetary) 3, Piloting (Space) 3, Survival 1. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pis­ tol (Ranged [Light]; Dam­ age 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting). SWOOP GANGER [RIVAL] Swoop gangs are considered by many to be a blight upon modern society. Take all of the problems that are posed by a conventional gang of young thugs and crimi­ nals and then place those criminals on overcharged, dangerously fast repulsorlift vehicles. The dangers posed by such a group are many, and the means of combating them are limited. There are few law forces capable of keeping pace with, much less outpacing and apprehend­ ing, a swoop gang. This is particularly true in the Outer Rim, where the legal resources are much more limited. Skills: Brawl 1, Piloting (Planetary) 1, Ranged (Light) I , Streetwise 1. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged (Light); Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range (Medium); Stun setting), mod­ ified swoop bikes. TWI'LEK BLACK MARKETEER [RIVAL] There are few races as consistently sociable as the Twi'leks of Ryloth. Capable of significant manipulation and persuasion, some Twi’leks invariably find their tal­ ents suited to helping others find things that they need, matching buyers to sellers with flawless skill and a thou­ sand-credit smile the entire while. Black marketeers are part salesman, part fence, and all business. Knowing a marketeer can ensure that an individual is able to move an incredibly rare and valuable item without difficulty, although it will be necessary to cut the marketeer in on the sale, which eats into profits a bit. Most consider the convenience a welcome trade-off for a percentage. Skills: Knowledge (Underworld) 2, Negotiation 2, Ranged (Light) 1, Skulduggery 2, Streetwise 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once), Black Market Con­ tacts 2 (decrease rarity of sought item by two degrees when looking on the black market). Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged (Light); Damage 6; Critical 3; Range (Medium); Stun setting), thermal det­ onator (Ranged (Light); Damage 20; Critical 2; Range (Short); Blast 1 5, Breach 1, Limited Ammo 1, Vicious 4), shock gloves (Brawl; Damage 2; Critical 5; Range (Engaged); Stun 3). SPACEPORT PERSONNEL Spaceports are a common haunt for galactic travel­ ers and adventurers of all sorts. Anyone who makes part of his life or livelihood aboard a starship will spend a significant amount of time in spaceports on one planet or another. Whether they are located in the desert, on a glacier, in a grand city, or hovering above the planet on a space station, there are cer­ tain commonalities that most spaceports share, and personnel is one of the most significant. COMM OPERATOR [RIVAL] Comm operators are the lifeblood of a spaceport. They are the ones who communicate with outgoing and incoming ships and manage approval of all de­ partures and arrivals. They endeavor to keep the traffic above a spaceport orderly and prevent acci­ dents. Such accidents happen anyway, but their rarity is testament to the skill of these officers. Some operators develop familiarities or even rela­ tionships with the ship crews they communicate with most frequently, and have been known to give preferential berths to close friends, or at least peo­ ple who remember who their friends are when the credits are flowing. Skills: Charm 2, Coercion 1, Cool 1, Knowledge (Out­ er Rim) 3. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged (Light); Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range (Medium); Stun setting), en­ encrypted comlink. CUSTOMS INSPECTOR [RIVAL] The customs official is the bane of existence for all those who seek to transport goods from one part of the galaxy to another without questions being asked. Fortunately, many officials are perfectly happy to ac­ cept a bribe. Unfortunately, there are quite a few who are not and even more unfortunately, telling the dif­ ference between the two can be exceptionally diffi­ cult. Customs inspectors are responsible for checking any cargo transported into a spaceport and their seal of approval is required before it can be offloaded onto another vessel or planet-bound location. They fre­ quently travel in the company of spaceport security. Skills: Astrogation 1, Perception 3, Vigilance 2. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), hand scanner. MON CALAMARI MECHANIC [RIVAL] Mechanics are a regular sight at any modern space­ port and most keep at least one trained mechanic per berth on staff to ensure that there are enough to meet the needs of their clients. Of course, many clients pre­ fer to maintain their own vessels, but those who have access to trained staff, like the naturally talented en­ gineers of the Mon Calamari race, are often wise to make use of such an opportunity. Mon Calamari typi­ cally take great pride in their work and are careful to ensure that any ship on which they are working oper­ ates at least as well as it did when it came off the showroom floor. Skills: Astrogation 1, Computers 1, Mechanics 2, Vigilance 1. Talents: None. Abilities: Amphibious (Mon Calamari may breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer move­ meant penalties for traveling through water). Equipment: Holdout blaster (Ranged [Light]; Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Stun setting), tool kit, emergency repair kit. SPACEPORT SECURITY DETAIL [MINION] Individuals who serve as part of a spaceport security detail possess the same authority as planetary law enforcement, although they have only a portion of the training and are limited solely to the grounds of the spaceport itself. Because of the much more limited mandate compared to most enforcement agencies, many spaceport security details have more narrowly- focused, but higher quality, equipment. Skills (group only): Perception, Ranged (Light). Talents: None Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), 2 stun grenades (Ranged [Light]; Damage 8; Critical - ; Range [Short]; Blast 8, Disorient 3, Limited Ammo 1, Stun Damage) padded armor ( + 2 soak). SPACEPORT SECURITY OFFICER [RIVAL] A busy spaceport is a chaotic place and although a security detail may be well meaning, they often need a firm hand to keep them on target and in charge of the goings-on—a spaceport won't police itself, after all. Security officers are often veterans of years of work in a given spaceport and are occasionally retired military or planetary law enforcement. They bring an entirely different perspective to the job and are much more able to identify and neutralize potential threats than the people working for them. Skills: Cool 1, Discipline 2, Ranged (Heavy) 2, Ranged (Light) 1, Resilience 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: None Equipment: Blaster rifle (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 9; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Stun setting), padded armor ( + 2 soak), stimpack. SPACEPORT ADMINISTRATOR [NEMESIS] On some worlds, a spaceport is like a tiny kingdom unto itself. On others, it is merely one cog in a vast bureaucratic machine that spans entire systems. Re­ gardless, the ultimate authority for the administration of a spaceport typically falls to a single being, at least in the short term, and that individual is authorized to make whatever decisions must be made for the good of the installation when trouble arises. A spaceport ad­ ministrator can be an incredible ally for a pilot and his crew or he can make their lives so miserable that they avoid certain spaceports at all cost. Skills: Charm 2, Coercion 2, Cool 2, Deception 2, Ranged (Light) 2, Perception 4, Streetwise 3, Vigilance 3. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all com­ bat checks against this target once), Nobody's Fool 1 (upgrade difficulty of Charm, Coercion, or Deception checks targeting Spaceport Administrator once), Plausible Deniability 2 (remove ■ ■ from all Coer­ cion and Deception checks). Abilities: Spaceport Leader (spaceport staff add □ to all Vigilance and Perception checks when in the Spaceport Administrator’s presence). Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged (Light); Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range (Medium); Stun setting), data- pad, comlink. SPACEPORT URCHIN [MINION] Every spaceport has at least one wretched misfit, and most have far more. A spaceport urchin is a young indi­ vidual, around ten years old by human standards, that seems to have absolutely nowhere else to go and north­ ing else to do than loiter around the facility sticking his nose into anything that attracts his attention. Constantly underfoot, frequently annoying, and occasionally larce­ nous, spaceport urchins can either be the bane of visit­ ing spacers or welcome mascots and familiar faces. Likewise, they can either be de­ spised by the spaceport staff or be looked upon as little broth­ ers and sisters to be watched over. The state and dispo­ sition of spaceport urchins says a great deal about the administration and policies of a spaceport in general. Skills (groups only): Skulduggery, Stealth, Streetwise, Survival. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Small rocks (Ranged (Light); Damage 1; Critical Range (Short); Stun Damage). BOUNTY HUNTERS Bounty hunters are feared by criminals and ne’er- do-wells throughout the galaxy. While they have the same authority to enforce legal penalties, they are not bound by the same code of conduct that planetary, system, and sector agen­ cies frequently operate under. Instead, bounty hunters have a well-deserved rep­ utation for violence and ruthless tactics. Many local branches of law enforcement are reluctant to bring in bounty hunters and may even choose not to cooperate with them at all because of their reputa­ tion for causing collateral damage when pursuing a criminal. System-wide and sec­ tor-wide agencies sometimes contract with bounty hunter guilds as a cost-effective way of extending their reach. Not all bounty hunters belong to guilds, of course. There are a great many hunters who es­ chew the companionship of others, instead taking up the solitary life of a predator. These statistics can reflect independent hunters, Imperially-spon­ sored hunters, or even unlicensed hunters just as well as guild hunters. APPRENTICE HUNTER [MINION] The number of certified and licensed bounty hunters in the galaxy is utterly dwarfed by the number of those who seek to become certified and licensed. Of the scores who seek to gain membership in an established bounty hunter guild, a handful who show promise are accepted into the ranks of the guild’s apprentices. The greatest value of these fledging, would-be hunt­ ers is that they are utterly expendable and are used by the guild as support for established hunters, diversions, or even simply cannon fod­ der against well-entrenched or well-armed foes. As an alternative to joining a guild, some aspirants instead apprentice themselves to an established independent hunter in hopes of proving worthy of the profession. Skills (group only): Perception, Ranged (Light). Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), heavy cloth­ ing (+1 soak). JOURNEYMAN HUNTER [RIVAL] Journeyman hunters have been accepted into the ranks of an existing guild and are fully accredited and licensed to pursue authorized bounties. They are the rank and file of most existing bounty hunter organizations and likely pursue any criminal whose bounty is not high enough to attract the attention of a Master Hunter. Journeymen may choose which bounties they pursue but also receive assignments from their guild. Sometimes guilds assign multiple journeymen to seek a particular target, although this might result in the journeymen fighting amongst themselves over who brings the target in. Skills: Brawl 1, Coercion 1, Coordination I , Ranged (Heavy) 1, Ranged (Light) 1, Survival 2, Vigilance 1. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once), Lethal Blows 1 (+ 10% to any Critical Injury rolls made against opponents). Abilities: None.

MASTER HUNTER [NEMESIS] Master hunters have reached a level of independence that permits them to choose any hunts they desire. The guilds never give master hunters orders, only requests. Master hunters typically have a ship at their disposal and can pursue their prey across the entire galaxy as needed. Master hunters occasionally have journeymen assigned to them as staff, although they often work alone. They are also authorized to deploy apprentice hunters as necessary to complete a hunt. Skills: Brawl 2, Coercion 2, Cool 2, Ranged (Heavy) 3, Ranged (Light) 2, Melee 2, Perception 3, Piloting (Space) 2, Stealth 2, Vigilance 3. Talents: Adversary 2 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target twice), Deadly Accuracy (add ranks of Ranged (Heavy) to all damage from attacks us­ ing that skill), Lethal Blows 2 (+ 20 to any Critical Injury rolls made against opponents), Stalker 2 (add □ □ to any Coordination and Stealth checks). Abilities: None. Equipment: Modded heavy blaster rifle (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 1 3; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Auto-fire, Cumbersome 3, Pierce 1), rifle flame projector attach­ meant (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 13; Critical 2; Range [Short]; Burn 5, Blast 8), vibroknife (Melee; Damage 5; Critical 2; Range [Engaged]; Pierce 2, Vicious 1), 4 stun grenades (Ranged [Light]; Dam­ age 8; Critical Range [Short]; Blast 8, Disorient 3, Limited Ammo 1, Stun Damage), heavy battle armor ( + 2 soak, +1 de­ fense). of the Corporate Sector’s inhabitants. Many “investiga­ tions" led by Espo captains last only as long as it takes to find a convenient scapegoat to blame.

Equipment: Riot gun (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium); Auto-Fire, Stun Setting), truncheon (Melee; Damage 4; Critical 5; Engaged; Disorient 2), riot armor (+ 2 soak). CORPORATE SECTOR AUTHORITY SECURITY CAPTAIN [RIVAL] The CSA often makes it a point to recruit tough, even bru­ tal individuals into the ranks of its Espos. Creative thinking or equitable public relations are not as desired as the abil­ ity to enforce the CSA’s rule through fear and violence. This applies to the Espos’ commanders as well as the rank and file. Captains in the Espos are brutal, no-nonsense individuals either promoted through the ranks or given the job due to corporate connections. Their enforcement tactics tend to treat brute force as the only resort instead of the last, a quality which does not endear them to many FORCES OF LAW & ORDER The forces of law and order will never stop in their campaign to enforce a boring and banal (or in other words, honest) lifestyle upon the independent-mind­ ed citizens of the galaxy. Sooner or later, the rogues and renegades who live on the galaxy's fringe all wind up on the wrong side of the law. CORPORATE SECTOR AUTHORITY SECURITY POLICE [MINION] The Corporate Sector A uthority is a massive cor­ porate bureaucracy that governs a large sector of space along the Tingel Arm of the galaxy in the O uter Rim territories. The government is, as indi­ cated by its name, a corporate e ntity that has complete control over the sector as a result of a unique arrangement that far predates the estab­ lishment of the Galactic Empire, but which is main­ tained through a m utually beneficial arrangement between those two bodies. The CSA enforces its policies and laws through its law enforcement d ivi­ sion: the Security Police. Commonly called Espos, the CSA police are known for th eir brutality as well as the quality of their equipment. They are much better-funded than most sector police forces and do not hesitate to crush anyone or anything that they believe threatens the peace and prosperity of the CSA’s rule over the Corporate Sector. CORPORATE SECTOR AUTHORITY VICEPREX [NEMESIS] The political and economic policies of the Empire ensure that any corporation that shows favor to the Imperial ma­ chine is rewarded with virtual autonomy so long as they do not make life difficult for Imperial personnel. No orga­ nization better exemplifies the dangers of this policy more so than the Corporate Sector Authority. The Corpo­ rate Sector Authority Viceprex level officials head up en­ tire departments of the CSA, from research to legal to territorial management. A Viceprex is a powerful individ­ ual whose rank and influence lets him ignore petty con­ cerns such as laws and regulations. The CSA does not overly care about the actions of their officials as long as the profits flow, so while one Viceprex might be honor­ able and honest, another may be corrupt and malicious. are completely unknown to the galaxy at large and, in many cases, even to each other; more than one member of the Hands believes that he or she is the only Emperor’s Hand, which is how the Emperor prefers his operatives to operate. The Emperor's Hands operate in absolute secrecy, often sent on missions by the Emperor himself. Members of the Emperor’s Hands almost invariably possess Force abilities and the will to use them. Skills: Charm 2, Coercion 4, Cool 2, Deception 3, Leadership 2, Negotiation 3, Knowledge (Education) 3, Knowledge (Outer Rim) 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once) Im­ proved Scathing Tirade (as an action, may make an Average [ 4 4 l Coercion check. Each & inflicts one strain on a target in short range. Each O inflicts one additional strain on one affected target. All affected targets suffer ■ to all checks for four rounds). Improved Inspir­ ing Rhetoric (as an action, may make an Average [ ♦ ♦ i Lead­ ership check Each & removes one strain or wound from one ally in short range. Each O removes an additional strain or wound from an af­ fected ally. All affected allies add □ to all checks for two rounds.). Abilities: None. Equipment: Holdout blaster (Ranged (Light); Damage 5; Critical 4; Range (Short); Stun setting), personal deflec­ tor shield, encrypted expense vouch­ er with 5,000-10,000 credits. EMPEROR'S HAND [NEMESIS] One of the Emperor’s Hands would be the most horrifying, panic-induc­ ing opponent that an individual could face—if anyone knew that the Emperor’s Hands existed. Fortu­ nately for the Hands, however, they Skills: Athletics 2, Brawl 2, Charm 3, Cool 3, Decep­ tion 3, Knowledge (Core Worlds) 3, Melee 3, Percep­ tion 2, Ranged (Heavy) 2, Ranged (Light) 3, Stealth 3, Vigilance 4. Talents: Adversary 3 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target three times), Intense Focus (suffer one strain to upgrade any skill check once), Stalker 2 (add □ □ to any Coordination and Stealth checks), Uncanny Senses 2 (add □ □ to all Perception checks), Force Rating 2. Abilities: Force Power: Influence ( • : inflict 2 Strain on target in short range. # : force one tar­ get in short range to adopt an emotional state or believe something even if it is untrue for four minutes or four rounds in combat), dark side Force user (uses dark side points instead of light side points, see page 278). Equipment: Disruptor pistol (Ranged (Light); Damage 10; Criti­ cal 2; Range (Short); Vicious 4), vibrosword (Melee; Damage 6; Critical 2; Range (Engaged); De­ fensive 1, Pierce 2, Vicious 1), frag grenade (Melee; Damage 8; Criti­ cal 4; Range (Short); Blast 6, Limited Ammo 1). IMPERIAL INTELLIGENCE AGENT [RIVAL] The resources at the disposal of the Imperial Intelligence Bureau are vir­ tually without limit and the agents who enact the Bureau’s will through­ out the galaxy are highly trained, extremely motivated, and absolutely lethal. Although their mandates and methodologies vary from agent to agent, the essential truth of the matter is that an intelligence agent will do abso­ lutely anything to ensure that whatever problem he or she has been dispatched to deal with is, in fact, dealt with permanently. If an agent determines that an individual may pose a threat to the stability of the Empire, either in the present or in the future, he may well forsake tradi­ tional measures and take it upon himself to ensure that the threat is neutralized. Skills: Brawl 2, Charm 2, Coercion 2, Deception 2, Ranged (Light) 2, Streetwise 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: None. Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged [Light); Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), scanner. IMPERIAL MOFF [NEMESIS] The title of Moff is one that has tremendous histori­ cal significance, but like so many other traditions, it has been completely co-opted by the Empire for its own purposes. Since the establishment of the Galactic Empire, the title of Moff has become a military and political term used to designate the Imperial official ultimately responsible for the governance of an en­ tire sector. Being appointed to a position as a Moff is an incredibly impressive achievement, one that is not easily overshadowed. Although there were slightly more than one thousand sectors during the height of the Republic, the Empire has changed some of them significantly and the present number of sectors is a point of confusion among many. Imperial Moffs have a reputation for arrogance and elitism, and in many cases, it is a reputation that is well earned. Some are die-hard patriots and rule with incredible attention to both detail and the letter of the law, while others prefer to oversee their sectors in a manner that is more ben­ eficial to them personally. The Emperor does not seem to care as long as individual Moffs can main­ tain order in their assigned regions. Those who do not can find themselves quickly replaced. Skills: Charm 3, Coercion 4, Cool 3, Deception 4, Dis­ cipline 3, Knowledge (Core Worlds) 4, Leadership 4, Ranged (Light) 2, Streetwise 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once), Plausible Deniability 4 (remove ■ ■ ■ ■ from any Coercion or Deception checks), Supreme Inspiring Rhetoric (as a maneuver, may make an Average Leadership check Each & removes one strain or wound from one ally in short range. Each O removes an additional strain or wound from an affected ally. All affected allies add □ to all checks for four rounds). Abilities: Imperial Valor (may perform a maneuver to cause all ranged attacks targeting the Moff to instead hit one ally or helpless enemy he is engaged with until the beginning of his next turn). Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting). IMPERIAL NAVAL TROOPER [MINION] Typically, only the larger fleet vessels in the Impe­ rial Navy carry contingents of the Imperial army. Therefore, the Imperial Navy maintains its own cadre of troops to serve as security forces aboard ship and to enact and defend against boarding ac­ tions if need be. In some cases, Imperial Naval troopers may also be deployed groundside, al­ though they are worse equipped than th eir Impe­ rial Arm y comrades. Imperial Navy troopers are typically equipped with reliable blaster pistols, small enough to be wielded easily in confined spaces aboard a ship and unable to fire a powerful enough blast to cause an unexpected hull breach. They also tend not to be equipped with heavy weapons or explosives for the same reason. Skills (group only): Perception, Ranged (Light). Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), blast vest and helmet (+ 1 soak). IMPERIAL NAVAL OFFICER [RIVAL] Officers in the Imperial Navy are highly trained, often at a military academy. Most of their duties naturally fall into the category of ship-bound activities, moni­ toring the hundreds or thousands of personnel neces­ sary to maintain the massive capital-scale ships the navy depends upon. However, it is also possible that officers are deployed at the head of naval troopers, taking part in ship-to-ship actions against pirates or independent vessels or even in sorties on the ground. In these cases, most naval officers prefer to lead from the rear, using their superior training and experience to direct the activities of their subordinates. Despite their reluctance to “get their hands dirty," it is unwise to underestimate naval officers. Skills: Discipline 3, Ranged (Light) 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: Tactical Direction (may spend a maneuver to direct one Imperial Navy minion group within medi­ um range. The group may perform an immediate free maneuver or add □ to their next check). Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), heavy uni­ form clothing (+1 Soak). IMPERIAL STORMTROOPER [MINION] Stormtroopers serve as a constant reminder of Impe­ rial might and, to many sentients, they are the visible symbol of the Empire. Stormtroopers are not part of the Imperial Army but are a separate corps of dedicated shock troops. With high-quality equipment and an ab­ solute disregard for anything other than achieving their objectives, stormtroopers are implacable foes on the battlefield and perform missions regular Army troops would be unable or unwilling to accomplish. There are a number of common specialized storm- trooper units that see deployment into unique and hos­ tile environments. These include sandtroopers (for des­ ert environments), snowtroopers (for extreme sub-zero temperature environments), and scout troopers (for long range reconnaissance with specialized repulsorlift train­ ing). Other, significantly less common variants such as the rad-zone stormtrooper (trained in operating within highly toxic or radioactive environments) exist as well, but are typically organized into self-contained units that are specially deployed depending upon the situation. Skills (group only): Athletics, Discipline, Melee, Ranged (Heavy). Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster rifle (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 9; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Stun setting), vibroknife (Me­ lee; Damage 4; Critical 2; Engaged; Pierce 2, Vicious 1), 2 frag grenades (Ranged [Light]; Damage 8; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Blast 6, Limited Ammo 1), stormtrooper armor ( + 2 soak), utility belt, extra reloads. Individuals or groups of 2 may be armed with light repeating blast­ ers with slings (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 11; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Auto-fire, Cumbersome 3, Pierce 1). Imperial stormtroopers are calculating, fearless indi­ viduals with a reputation for efficiency and an absolute lack of mercy or any emotion in the execution of their duties. Stormtrooper sergeants, who command squads of eight such individuals, are expected to exemplify those traits and show an increased grasp of tactics and abilities. Stormtrooper sergeants tend to be extremely motivated and self-assured individuals that place the mission above all else, sacrificing anything necessary to achieve the objective at hand. They can also carry more powerful weaponry than the rank and file. Skills: Athletics 2, Discipline 2, Leadership 3, Melee 2, Ranged (Heavy) 2, Ranged (Light) 2, Resilience 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficul­ ty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: Tactical Direction (may spend a maneuver to direct one Stormtrooper minion group within medi­ um range. The group may perform an immediate free maneuver or add □ to their next check). Equipment: Heavy blaster rifle (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 10; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Auto-fire, Cumbersome 3), vibroknife (Melee; Damage 4; Critical 2; Engaged; Pierce 2, Vicious 1), 2 frag grenades (Ranged [Light]; Damage 8; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Blast 6, Limited Ammo 1), stormtrooper armor ( + 2 soak), utility belt, extra reloads. MILITARY STARFIGHTER PILOT [MINION] Starfighters are an essential component of any major military installation. The small, fast ships can harry much larger targets and support a vast array of fire­ power that can make them a threat even to capital- scale vessels. The tactics of the Rebel Alliance, and particularly their victory at the Battle of Yavin, has demonstrated that starfighters can be a vital compo­ nent of any attack force. Starfighters may be tasked with defending parent ships against enemy starfight­ ers, scouting and reconnaissance, or even heavy as­ saults on enemy ships or installations. However, the pilots of these vessels almost always possess quick re­ flexes, talented piloting skills, and a foolhardy bravado. Skills (group only): Gunnery, Piloting (Space). Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range [Medium]; Stun Setting), vac­ uum sealed flight suit. PLANETARY DEFENSE FORCE TROOPER [MINION] There are very few planets that rely entirely on an out­ side agency for their protection. Most possess at least a marginal military force of their own, dedicated to pro­ tecting the planet’s most valuable or sacred sites. Plan­ etary defense troopers rarely have the most advanced or most up-to-date equipment, often employing locally produced weaponry and armor, but what they do have is typically well made and serves its purpose. Skills (group only): Brawl, Discipline, Ranged (Light), Ranged (Heavy). Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster carbine (Ranged [Heavy]; Dam­ age 9; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), 2 frag grenades (Ranged [Light]; Damage 8; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Blast 6, Limited Ammo 1) blast vest (+ 1 soak). PLANETARY GOVERNOR [NEMESIS] In the eyes of the Empire, a planet is the smallest au­ tonomous body of note anywhere within the galaxy. Cities and nations are of no real consequence to a bureaucracy as large as the Empire, but a planet-wide government can at least offer a significant quantity of resources, some extremely valuable, to an extent that makes a planet worthy of attention. For that reason, planetary governors are at least a consideration even to the officers of the Imperial Navy. They are given due consideration and their independence is not trod upon unless absolutely necessary. If planetary consid­ erations stand in the way of the Imperial agenda, how­ ever, they are swept aside without a thought; even the most considerate of Imperial officers has his limits. Skills: Charm 3, Coercion 4, Cool 2, Deception 3, Per­ ception 4, Knowledge (Education) 4, Leadership 3, Ranged (Light) 3, Piloting (Planetary) 2, Resilience 2, Streetwise 2, Skulduggery 3, Vigilance 2. Talents: Improved Inspiring Rhetoric (as an action, may make an Average ♦ ) Leadership check Each # removes one strain or wound from one ally in short range. Each O removes an additional strain or wound from an affected ally. All affected allies add □ to all checks for three rounds), Kill with Kindness 2 (re m o v e ■ ■ fro m all Charm and Leadership checks), Nobody’s Fool 2 (upgrade difficulty of all Charm, Coercion, and Deception checks targeting Planetary Governor twice). Abilities: Leader (all subordinates within medium range add □ to all Discipline checks). Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range [Medium]; Stun setting). SECTOR RANGER [RIVAL] There are a great number of similarities among the majority of law enforcement personnel, but few are cut from the same mold as the Sector Rangers. These individuals are authorized by the Empire, through the local sector government, to seek out any and all viola­ tions of law in an entire sector of the galaxy. In many ways, sector rangers are the opposite of smugglers; fiercely independent and possessed of a tremendous degree of autonomy and ingenuity. But instead of self­ ish desires for wealth, they possess a strong desire to see justice served. Sector rangers rarely work well with others but their tenacity can hound a lawbreaker across a sector and back, making them among the most carefully avoided authorities in the galaxy. Skills: Athletics 2, Brawl 1, Cool 2, Coordination 2, Ranged (Heavy) 3, Ranged (Light) 3, Streetwise 3, Survival 3, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), scoped blaster rifle (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 9; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Stun Setting, reduce difficulty of combat checks at long range by I ) heavy clothing (+1 soak). PATRONS & CLIENTS Few pilots, smugglers, or mercenaries make a liv­ ing independently, with­ out the need for someone to offer them credits in exchange for the qual­ ity of their trade. In­ deed, all these sorts of ne’er-do-wells require a patron or client in order to make their way suc­ cessfully in the galaxy. The kind of clients that hire an individual says a great deal about that being’s character and skills and the greater the skill, the greater the reward. BLACK SUN VIGO [NEMESIS] The Black Sun is a vast criminal conspir­ acy that literally spans almost the en­ tire breadth of the galaxy. Its upper ech­ elons are a mystery to all but its most in­ fluential and power­ ful members, and the most that the average member can ever hope to know is the identity of a Vigo. The Vi­ gos of Black Sun are akin to criminal nobility, princes of vice, underbosses of mayhem and misery. A Vigo is powerful enough that he or she may control all criminal activity in an entire sector or an even larger portion of space, making them rivals even for the great Hutt lords that are so feared in the Outer Rim. For all their power, influence, and wealth, however, Vigos still answer to their superiors, and for that reason they often have more conservative natures than the hedonistic Hutts. Skills: Coercion 4, Cool 3, Melee 3, Negotiation 3, Perception 4, Ranged (Heavy) 3, Ranged (Light) 3, Streetwise 4, Survival 4, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 3 (upgrade difficulty of all com­ bat checks against this target three times), Crippling Blow (may increase damage of check by 1. If suc­ cessful, target suffers one strain when he moves for remainder of encounter), Nobody’s Fool 2 (upgrade difficulty of all Charm, Coercion, and Deception checks targeting Vigo twice). Abilities: Leader (all subordinates within medium range add □ to all Discipline checks). Equipment: Heavy blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting), force pike (Melee; Damage 6; Critical 2; Range [En­ gaged]; Pierce 2, stun setting). HUTT CRIME LORD [NEMESIS] There are few races in the galaxy that are so simul­ taneously hated and feared as the Hutts. These massive beings have a stranglehold on the criminal underworld in entire regions of the galaxy, including the portion aptly named Hutt Space, much of the Outer Rim, and even portions of the Mid Rim. Hutts typically operate in cartels, which are based around their own familial clans. Individual members of a clan can control an entire spaceport or even a whole planet. Typically, Hutts are arrogant, self-centered creatures who prefer to be amused and adored at all times. They surround themselves with all manner of sycophants and criminal underlings in crude courts that are a parody of what might be found on Corus- cant or other civilized worlds. There are many who make the mistake of under­ estim ating a Hutt, looking on them as bloated, gluttonous slugs. This assessment is completely correct. However, it misses two im portant points. One is the extrem ely cunning and devious mind that dwells within the bloated exterior. The Hutt cartels do effectively rule H utt Space, no m atter what the Empire claims. The second point is that although Hutts may not be dexterous, they are ex­ trem ely strong beneath th eir rolls of fat. Skills: Athletics 1, Charm 2, Coercion 4, Cool 5, De­ ception 5, Discipline 5, Knowledge (Outer Rim) 3, Knowledge (Underworld) 3, Leadership 1, Melee 2, Negotiation 5, Ranged (Light) 2, Resilience 8. Talents: Convincing Demeanor 2 (remove up to ■ ■ from any Deception or Skulduggery check), Durable 3 (subtract 30 from Critical Injury rolls made against the Hutt), Nobody’s Fool 3 (upgrade difficulty of all Charm, Coercion, and Deception checks targeting Hutt by 3) Resolve 2 (when suffering strain, reduce the amount suffered by 2 to a minimum of 1). Abilities: Awkward (Hutts have great physical strength but their bulk imposes severe limitations in flexibility and agility. They add ■ ■ ■ to all Brawl, Melee, and Coordination checks they're required to make), Ponderous (Hutts can never spend more than one maneuver moving per turn). Equipment: Generally none; if a Hutt needs some­ thing, he usually has an attendant to carry and use it. However, Hutts can wield weapons such as vibro- axes (Melee; Damage 9; Critical 2; Range [Engaged); Pierce 2, Sunder, Vicious 3) or large-bore blaster pis­ tols (Ranged [Light]; Damage 8; Critical 3; Range [Me­ dium]; Stun Setting, Hutt Only). CORRUPT BUREAUCRAT [RIVAL] Politics is a deadly game and often those who play it have a wide variety of plots and machinations in mo­ tion at any one time. Many of these depend upon the extensive use of ignorant, expendable pawns. Crimi­ nals, and those who society would prefer to ignore, are ideally suited for this manner of operation. A cunning politico knows how to make use of such vassals, prom­ ising them enough cash to ensure they are interested without asking too many questions. Those who can get the job done and keep their mouths shut can find lu­ crative, long-term employment, while those who cause too much of a spectacle can quietly be diverted into situations that allow the problem to resolve itself, usu­ ally in a violent manner. Skills: Charm 2, Coercion 1, Cool 2, Deception 3, Negotiation 4. Talents: Plausible Deniability 1 (When making a Coercion or Deception check, remove ■ from the check), N obody’s Fool 2 (When targeted by a Co­ ercion or Deception check, upgrade the difficulty by 2). Abilities: None. Equipment: Light blaster pistol (Ranged (Light); Dam­ age 5; Critical 4; Range [Medium]; Stun setting). REBEL ALLIANCE LIAISON [RIVAL] The Alliance to Restore the Republic is a vast organi­ zation that would be a serious threat if it didn’t stand in opposition to perhaps the most extensive military organization ever created: the Galactic Empire. As a result, the Alliance must operate in the shadows, working with small groups to achieve minor objectives in hopes of building toward a much larger victory one day in the distant future. Most Rebels have no object­ tion to working with criminals and other "scum,” even if some among their leadership object to such sullying alliances. Smugglers in particular are popular agents for the Alliance because the credits are good and the work is exciting, if dangerous. Skills: Coordination 1, Cool 1, Discipline 2, Melee 1, Negotiation 3, Ranged (Heavy) 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: None. Equipment: Blaster rifle (Ranged [Heavy]; Damage 9; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Stun setting), molecular sti­ letto (Melee; Damage 2; Critical 2; Range [Engaged]; Pierce 2), padded armor ( + 2 soak) CORE WORLDERS The glittering and wealthy Core Worlds stand apart from the rest of the galaxy. Those who live there seem to believe that the Core Worlds are the entire galaxy, or at least the only part of the galaxy that matters. Core Worlders seldom leave the Core Worlds, and those from poorer planets may spend their whole lives dreaming of someday visiting the Core. ARROGANT HEIR [RIVAL] Wealthy citizens of the Core Worlds are usually blind to the privilege and arrogance that are the hallmarks of their lives. Since birth, they have been taught that they are the leaders of the galaxy—economically, politically, spiritually, and in all other ways. Inevitably, there are those amongst the people who have everything who want more, and these arrogant heirs may well come into conflict or contact with the galactic underworld. The in­ dependent operators of the fringe must tread carefully around these individuals, for fear of drawing the atten­ tion of more powerful Core World interests. Skills: Charm 1, Coercion 2, Cool 1, Knowledge (Core Worlds) 2, Knowledge (Education) 2. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Duelist blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Accurate 2, Stun setting), servants, credit stick with 200-400 credits. PHILANTHROPIC SENATOR [RIVAL] Imperial Senators have a great deal of influence throughout the galaxy, even after the dissolution of the Senate by the Emperor’s decree. Since the Sen­ ate’s dissolution, the Senators have a great deal of time on their hands and significant resources. Many choose to travel the galaxy, looking for ways to al­ leviate the suffering of the people who have been oppressed under the new totalitarian doctrines of the Empire. Although it is not particularly common for these individuals to come into contact with the criminal underworld, it certainly is not out of the realm of possibility, particularly if the criminals in question have some resource that the Senator thinks can be of use to the poor and downtrodden. Skills: Charm 3, Cool 2, Deception 1, Knowledge (Core Worlds) 2, Knowledge (Education) 2, Leadership 3, Negotiation 4, Vigilance 1. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Holdout blaster (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Stun setting), aides. WEALTHY NOBLE [RIVAL] The noble families of the Core Worlds are so insulated from the rest of the galaxy that they often lack even the most essential understanding of the realities of society beyond their own privileged circles. Younger members of the caste, hungry for adventure and exciting stories with which to top their rivals in court, sometimes ven­ true out into the greater galaxy in search of interesting experiences. These dilettantes are often more of an an­ noyance than anything else, but their wealth and influ­ ence can many times open doors that might be un­ available under other circumstances. For that reason alone, some members of the criminal underworld are willing to associate with “slumming” nobles in search of a good time. Often these individuals cause as much trouble as they alleviate and most never realize the real danger they are placing themselves in until it is far, far too late to do anything about it. Skills: Charm 3, Cool 1, Deception 3, Knowledge (Ed­ ucation) 2, Melee 2. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Holdout blaster (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Stun setting), antique vibro- sword (Melee; Damage 4; Critical 2; Range [Engaged]; Defensive 1, Pierce 2, Vicious 1) personal shuttle (use the Lambda class shuttle profile on page 256). DROIDS Droids are as common a sight in the greater galaxy as star- ships or blasters and can be found in virtually every con­ ceivable environment. Alterations to their structure and programming allow droids to function in otherwise pro­ hibitive environments, meaning that droids may be found anywhere in the galaxy. The vast majority are simply ma­ chines, laboring in the background to complete tasks that an advanced society requires to function. A smaller portion PURCHASING DROIDS D roids occupy a unique position in Edge of the Em pir e, as they can be commodities for purchase but also sentient NPCs or adversar­ ies. Therefore, they are presented in this chap­ ter. However, if players wish to purchase these droids, they can consult the following chart for rarity and prices. TABLE 12-1: DRDID PRICES Droid Type Cost Rarity Antiquated Battle Droid 6 500 5 Assassin Droid (R) 65,000 8 Astromech Droid 8 250 3 Maintenance Droid 7,500 3 Medical Droid 12,000 4 Protocol Droid 8,000 4 Security Droid 9,600 5 is much more advanced, capable of interacting with living beings with a semblance of the independence and creativ­ ity that the organic enjoy. And of course, there are those few that are far more than simple tools and instead can become tremendous allies or terrifying opponents. Droids are typically divided into five broad catego­ ries depending upon their function. These divisions are referred to as Class I through Class V and give a general idea of how a droid from a given class can be expected to behave, what capabilities it has, and what behaviors it is likely to exhibit. Class I droids in­ clude perhaps the most advanced droids among their ranks, designed as they are for medical and health- related purposes. Many Class II droids are designed for engineering and maintenance tasks and as such are more like self-aware tools than their peers among the other classes, though they can develop quirky personalities. Class III droids are designed to inter­ act with organic beings in a variety of fashions, from the protocol droids that are frequently employed in diplomatic circles to the governess droids that the especially wealthy sometimes rely upon to care for their children. Class IV droids are by far the most re­ stricted and heavily controlled, because they are de­ signed for use in combat. Finally, the simplest of all droids can usually be found among the numbers of Class V droids, which are generally designed for the purpose of simple, non-electronic repairs and menial labor. Class V droids can generally be said to have the least advanced processors and cognitive function of any droid class. ANTIQUATED BATTLE DROID [MINION] The most frequently encountered droid of this type is the B1 battle droid produced by Baktoid Combat Au­ tomata. A generation ago. these frail-looking droids were the terror of the galaxy. Legions of them formed the Separatist armies during the Clone Wars but the intervening years have not been kind to their design, which was inexpensive to begin with. Although no rep­ utable military still employs these droids in number, they can be found in limited quantities in the forces of crime lords, mercenaries, and various other ne’er-do- wells throughout the underbelly of the galaxy. Skills (group only): Ranged (Heavy). Talents: None. Abilities: Droid (does not need to breathe, eat, or drink and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Im­ mune to poisons or toxins.). Equipment: Blaster rifle (Ranged (Heavy); Damage 9; Critical 3; Range (Long), Stun setting). ASSASSIN DROID [NEMESIS] Illegal virtually everywhere in the known galaxy, assassin droids are sophisticated killing machines that combine physical acumen with the mental faculties to apply it in a variety of different circumstances. Most importantly, however, these droids are designed without the univer­ sal restrictions that prevent droids from taking action against organic life. While they are incredibly deadly to those whom they are set to hunt, assassin droids are equally dangerous to those who create or employ them. These droids simply have no recognition of the value of life, and will destroy anyone or anything in their path if doing so benefits them in some way. Skills: Coercion 3, Computers 4, Gunnery 5, Mechan­ ics 3, Melee 3, Ranged (Heavy) 5, Ranged (Light) 5, Piloting (Planetary) 3, Piloting (Space) 3, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 2 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target twice), Barrage 3 (add three to the damage of all Gunnery or Ranged attacks at me­ dium or long range), Point Blank 3 (add 3 damage to all Ranged (Heavy) or Ranged (Light) attacks made at short or engaged range). Abilities: Droid (does not need to breathe, eat, or drink and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Im­ mune to poisons or toxins.). Equipment: Light repeating blaster (Ranged (Heavy); Damage 11; Critical 3; Range [Long]; Auto-fire, Cumber­ some 4, Pierce 1), built-in light blaster pistol (Ranged (Light); Damage 5; Critical 3; Range (Medium); Stun Setting), built-in missile tube (Gunnery; Damage 20; Critical 3; Range (Extreme); Blast 10, Breach 1, Cum­ bersome 3, Guided 3, Limited Ammo 6), built in razor- claws (Melee; Damage 6; Critical 4; Range (Engaged)). A5TROMECH DROID [RIVAL] A common sight throughout the galaxy, astromech droids such as the famous R2 series are relatively small, utilitarian droids designed to interface with and maintain machinery of varying complexities depending upon the model of the droid. Many technologies are designed with these sorts of droids in mind, and have sockets to allow a direct interface with the droid. Some ships are even designed with the intent of offloading certain com­ putting functions to an interfaced droid (for example, some starfighters rely on interfaced astromech droids to serve as a navicomouters for hvoersDace travell. Skills: Astrogation 3, Computers 3, Cool 2, Mechan­ ics 2, Piloting (Space) 2. Talents: None. Abilities: Droid (does not need to breathe, eat, or drink and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Im­ mune to poisons or toxins.). Equipment: Arc welder (Melee; Damage 3; Critical - ; Range [Engaged]; Stun Damage), built-in repair tools (counts as tool kit). MAINTENANCE DROID [MINION] Taking a m ultitude of forms, maintenance droids can appear in literally any shape imaginable, from spider-like machines to small, box-like automatons and even to large, vehicle-sized behemoths that re­ pair bridges and the like. They can be found any­ where in the galaxy that has the proper technology level to support droids and starports in particular are typically crawling with the things. Maintenance droids generally have a low level of intelligence and are not a threat to organic beings, but malfunctions or malicious reprogramming have been known to turn them against their masters, sometimes with terribly effective results. Skills (group only): Mechanics. Talents: None. Abilities: Droid (does not need to breathe, eat, or drink and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Im­ mune to poisons or toxins.). Equipment: Arc welder (Melee; Damage 3; Critical Range [Engaged]; Stun Damage) built-in repair tools (counts as tool kit as well as emergency repair kit that can be used once per session). MEDICAL DROID [RIVAL] Medical droids take a variety of forms, from simple attendant droids capable of dressing flesh wounds or diagnosing basic illnesses up to the elaborate and in­ credibly advanced surgical droids that can be found on military starships and major urban centers throughout the galaxy. Skills: Discipline 1, Medicine 3, Perception 2. Talents: None. Abilities: Droid (does not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Immune to poisons or toxins.). Equipment: Built-in diagnostic and surgical tools (count as medpac as well as stimpack that can be used once per session). PROTOCOL DROID [RIVAL] With hundreds or thousands of intelligent races scat­ tered across millions of planets throughout the galaxy, communication can be a significant problem when di­ plomacy is required. Protocol droids are designed to solve this problem, with the advanced computer brains of these automatons retaining literally millions of lan­ guages at a time. As the name indicates, the droids are not only translators but also serve to prevent misun­ derstandings by ensuring cultural problems do not arise. It is for this reason that, if these droids are left without a memory wipe and begin to develop a person­ ality, they tend to be highly anxious and nervous. Skills: Charm 2, Knowledge (Education) 3, Knowledge (Xenology) 3, Negotiation 2, Perception 1. Talents: None. Abilities: Droid (does not need to breathe, eat, or drink and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Im­ mune to poisons or toxins.), etiquette and protocol (protocol droids allow allies to add □ to any Nego­ tiation checks or other checks made to negotiate or mediate). Equipment: None. SECURITY DROID [RIVAL] A more civilized and restricted version of assassin droids, security droids are not illegal but are carefully regulated because of the potential for abuse. Security droids are typically programmed with significant knowledge of law enforcement protocols and often update using local databases when traveling to ensure that their actions are in accordance with planetary, system, and sector law. Typically, security droids are assigned to protect specific locations or individuals and will respond to any threat against their charge with appropriate, sometimes lethal, force. Skills: Ranged (Light) 3, Vigilance 3. Talents: None. Abilities: Droid (does not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Im­ mune to poisons or toxins.). Equipment: Built-in blaster pistol (Ranged (Light); Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun Setting), snare launcher (Ranged (Light); Damage - ; Critical - ; Range (Short); Ensnare 5, Limited Ammo 1). GALACTIC ODDITIES AND FRINGE DWELLERS There is no end to the variety of races and individuals that can be found if one travels far enough from home throughout the various sectors of the Galactic Empire and beyond. Although cataloging all of the potential allies and enemies that an adventurer might encoun­ ter is impossible, a few of the more exotic varieties can be found below. FORSAKEN JEDI [NEMESIS] The Jedi are an ancient order whose light has essentially disappeared from the galaxy. As far as the vast majority of the galaxy is concerned, the Jedi are extinct and their ancient ways were prone to treachery and failure. This is what the Empire has told the people of the galaxy and many believe it. The truth, while not far from the story, is not entirely the same. A handful of Jedi survived the purge that accompanied the birth of the Empire. Most died in subsequent years, but a few remain in hiding. And there are a few whom the Empire never bothered to hunt. Those who fall into this last category are haunted by their failures and by the fact that they are not even enough of a threat to warrant the Empire's attention. Most have succumbed to self-pity and vice of one form or another. If they do not already embrace the dark side, they are not far from doing so. Skills: Coercion 2, Cool 2, Deception 3, Knowledge (Lore) 4, Lightsaber 4, Melee 2, Perception 4, Piloting (Space) 2, Streetwise 3, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 2 (upgrade difficulty of all com­ bat checks against this target twice), Force Rating 3, Sense Danger (once per session, remove ■ ■ f r o m any check), Sense Emotions (add □ to all Charm, Coercion, and Deception checks), Uncanny Senses 2 (add □ □ to all Perception checks). Abilities: Force power Move (O Move up to two ob­ jects Silhouette 1 at medium range; may make ranged attacks with this power [see page 283)), Force power Sense (Q Sense all living things within medium range. O Sense the emotional state of one target within me­ dium range. Ongoing effect (O): Upgrade difficulty of at­ tacks targeting Forsaken Jedi twice), On the edge (once per Force check, may suffer 1 strain to use • result to generate O)- Equipment: Lightsaber (Lightsaber; Damage 10; Critical 1; Range (Engaged); Breach 1, Defensive 1, Deflection 2, Sunder, Vicious 2). Camorreans are porcine humanoids with a penchant for barbarism and thuggishness. Hailing from the Outer Rim planet of Camorr, these violent and thoroughly dull-witted creatures would likely have never made it into the wider galaxy. However, at some point some enterprising individual realized that the Gamorreans complete unpleasantness was matched only by their utility as dumb, strong muscle. Now many individuals from crime barons to wealthy nobles employ Gamor­ reans as guards. They are unintelligent enough to be difficult to bribe and strong enough to be truly terrify­ ing in a fight. G A M O R R E A N T H U G [R IV A L ] Skills: Brawl 3, Melee 3. Talents: Knockdown (after hitting with a Melee attack, the attacker may spend to knock the target prone). Abilities: None. Equipment: Crude Gamorrean vibro-ax (Melee; Dam­ age 7; Critical 4; Range [Engaged]; Pierce 2, Vicious 3). The noble Ithorian people, often known by the semi- derogatory nickname "Hammerheads" because of their unique cranial shape, are known for their peace­ ful, scholarly nature and their devotion to the natural environments of the galaxy. Many Ithorians travel the galaxy aboard massive ships known as “herd ships,” although some choose to travel in a solitary manner. Those who do are often steeped in the traditions and lore of their people and enjoy gathering stories of oth­ ers like themselves. To them, stories are a unique form of culture that should be studied and maintained at all costs and they are happy to speak with others who might have stories to share with them. IT H O R IA N S T O R Y T E L L E R [R IV A L ] Skills: Charm 3, Cool 1, Knowledge (Lore) 3. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Holdout blaster (Ranged [Light]; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Stun setting). MYNOCK [MINION] Mynocks are disgusting, silicon-based space para­ sites that survive by latching onto the hulls of star- ships and feeding o ff power cables and other vital systems. About a meter long with wings th a t could be used in atmosphere, they have spread through­ out the galaxy by hitching rides on passing star- ships. They absorb m atter and energy from th eir hosts, which can eventually cause sys­ tem failure. Mynocks can be found on the surface of several different worlds, although their allergy to helium lim its the number of habitats in which they can survive. Skills (group only): Brawl, Coordination. Talents: None. Abilities: Vacuum Dweller (can survive in vacuum without penalty, and can move in a vacuum envi­ ronment), Energy Parasite (mynocks can make an Average Coordination check to latch onto any starship or vehicle they are engaged with. Ships or vehicles with a mynock attached suffer 1 system strain per mynock each day and reduce their han­ dling by 1), Flyer (mynocks can fly, see page 202), Helium Allergy (when exposed to helium, mynocks suffer 1 wound per round ignoring soak, until their bodies inflate and explode). Equipment: Sucker-mouths and claws (Brawl; Dam­ age 4; Critical 5; Range [Engaged]). TWI'LEK DANCER [MINION] Dance is a highly valued form of entertainment through­ out the galaxy and there are few traditions that are more famous than the Twi’lek dancing girls of Ryloth. The sen­ sual beauty of a Twi’lek is something that few who have witnessed it ever forget, and it is the popularity of their skills that has contributed, at least in part, to the tradi­ tion of slavery that is so rampant on Ryloth. Not only are there countless parties eager to make a profit by captur­ ing and selling young Twi’leks, but unfortunately, there are many influential members of the race who are con­ tent to line their own pockets by doing the same thing. Among those who enter the life of a dancer, however, there are some who find that they enjoy it. Those who do are typically able to make a good living entertaining the masses, although there are always those who find themselves in servitude to horrible masters like Jabba the Hutt, who is known to favor such dancers in his wretched court on the planet of Tatooine. Skills (group only): Charm, Coordination. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Dancing attire. WOOKIEE GLADIATOR [RIVAL] The Wookiees are a noble and honorable race with a proud warrior tradition. Unfortunately for them, they are also fiercely independent and greatly val­ ue individuality and personal liberties. This is obvi­ ously a problem for the Empire and it is likely for that reason that the Imperial bureaucracy autho­ rized the Wookiees as a slave race, making it le­ gal for certain agencies to enslave them. The race’s home planet of Kashyyyk is something of a prison now and any Wookiee who attem pts to leave the planet risks never being able to return. Because of their physical prowess as warriors, many enslaved Wookiees have found their way into the criminal underworld where they are pitted against other warriors in gladiatorial blood matches and various other illegal combat situations. Wookiees in this sit­ uation tend to have succumbed to despair and lost themselves in their anger and bitterness. They are terrifying opponents to face in combat, but if one can gain their trust, they also prove eternal allies. Skills: Athletics 2, Brawl 4, Coordination 2, Melee 4, Ranged (Heavy) 2, Vigilance 2. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: Wookiee Rage (when the Wookiee Gladi­ ator suffers any wounds, he deals + 1 damage with Brawl and Melee attacks. When suffering a Critical Injury, he deals +2 damage with Brawl and Melee at­ tacks instead). Equipment: Vibro-ax (Melee; Damage 8; Critical 2; Range [Engaged]; Pierce 2, Sunder, Vicious 3). YARKORATREASURE HUNTER [RIVAL] The Yarkora are a mysterious, long-lived race whose homeworld remains undiscovered by greater galactic society. Some members of their race have found their way into the seediest ports of call in the Outer Rim and use their incredibly patient methods to manipulate se­ crets out of even the most closely guarded individuals. These secrets they then use in the sale of information or, for more profitable endeavors, the discovery of lost items and legacies to line their own coffers. Yarkora rec­ ognize the sentience of other races but do not truly con­ sider most races to be their equal, and look upon them as lesser beings that exist only to assist them in the ful­ fillment of their agenda. This is not to say that they do not develop affections for others, but there is always a degree of reservation that ensures they are not fully committed to relations with outsiders. Skills: Charm 2, Coercion 4, Cool 2, Deception 4, Knowledge (Lore) 2. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Heavy blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium], Stun setting). MID-SIZED DIANOGA [RIVAL] Few creatures have benefited as much from space- flight as the dianoga. Though coming from Vodran originally, the dianoga has a predilection for hitching rides in space-going vessels. More specifically, it lives in the garbage disposal facilities of starships and from there this monstrous cephalopod has spread to the waste disposal facilities of cities and space stations across the galaxy. Dianogas are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and naturally translucent, making them hard to eradicate and spot. The dianoga’s larval form is almost micro­ scopic, allowing it to sneak aboard starships easily. However, it can grow to be up to 10 meters across, a writhing collection of tentacles surrounding a fanged maw and central body core. The dianoga has a single eye on a stalk that it can extend out of the water while the bulk of the creature remains below the surface. The dianoga is scavenger and hunter both and while it primarily survives on garbage, it’s more than happy to eat anything that ends up in its lair, alive or not. Skills: Brawl 2, Perception 1, Stealth 4, Survival 2, Vigilance 3. Talents: Adversary 1 (upgrade difficulty of all combat checks against this target once). Abilities: Amphibious (Dianogas may breathe un­ derwater without penalty and never suffer move­ meant penalties for traveling through water), Crushing Crip (A dianoga has many tentacles and can main­ tain a grip on an unfortunate with some while attack­ ing with others. As long as it has a victim immobilized by its tentacles, it inflicts 2 strain and 1 wound at the start of the victim ’s turn. A dianoga is an aquatic creature and a creature immobilized beneath the surface may well start drowning—see page 214 for more information about suffocation and drowning.). Equipment: Tentacles (Brawl; Damage 5; Critical 4; Range [Engaged]; Ensnare 4, Knockdown). CAPTIVE RANCOR [NEMESIS] Rancors are terrifying predators, found on worlds throughout the galaxy. Complete carnivores, an adult rancor can grow to be up to 10 meters tall. They often walk with a hunched, simian gait using their arms and hands as well as their legs. Their hands and wicked claws can be used for grasping and holding prey. Com­ bined with their prodigious strength, a rancor can be­ come an apex predator on most worlds it lives in. Their fearsome combat ability makes rancors popular amongst crime lords as gladiatorial opponents or "pets." The infamous gangster Jabba the Hutt is known to keep a rancor in a cavern below his palace, and those who displease the crime lord all too often become the rancor's next meal. Skills: Brawl 2, Perception 2, Survival 3, Vigilance 2. Talents: None. Abilities: Silhouette 3, Sweep attack (The rancor can spend ^ on a successful Brawl check to hit the target as well as anyone engaged with the target). Equipment: Massive rending claws (Brawl; Damage 1 5; Critical 3; Range [Short]; Knockdown, Sunder). GUN DARK [RIVAL] Gundarks are vicious and strong mammalian anthro­ poids from Vanqor, an arid planet of deserts and can­ yons. The creature is bigger and more powerful than an average human, with two legs, four arms, and ears almost as large as its head. They are relatively intelli­ gent beasts, and their cunning combined with their unpleasant temperament means they are popular gladiatorial fodder in some parts of the galaxy. Skills: Brawl 2, Perception 3, Survival 3, Vigilance 3. Talents: None. Abilities: Four-armed (the gundark gains D o n all Brawl checks and may spend O O on a successful melee at­ tack to hit a second target engaged with it, dealing the same damage as dealt to the original target). Equipment: Meaty fists (Brawl; Damage 8; Critical 4; Range [Engaged]; Knockdown, Disorient 1). TROUBLE BREWING “Pirates? Smugglers? We don't have any of them on Formos." -L ie u te n a n t Pavan, Formos Garrison T his adventure is set on the planet of Formos, a backwater world in the Outer Rim. The planet itself is not particularly notable, but stands at the junction of two busy hyperspace routes. The Pabol Sleheyron runs Coreward into nearby Hutt Space while the Triel- lus Trade Route provides access to both spinward and trailing regions of the Outer Rim. Furthermore, For­ mos is directly linked to the mining world of Kessel via a narrow corridor of navigable space called the Kes­ sel Run. As a result, Formos has become a notorious haven for all manner of smugglers, spacers, and scum. In recent times, a vicious pirate named Bandin Dobah has begun to exert control over the move­ meant of contraband in and out of the Formos Spaceport. This ruthless and ambitious Aqualish has earned himself some powerful enemies; after all, the planet of Formos is close to Hutt Space and they do not tolerate direct com petition of this sort for long. So far Dobah has kept one step ahead of justice, and he has managed to build and maintain control through a combination of force and dumb ck—for the time being, at least. There are currently two bounties on Dobah’s head. The Empire offers the first bounty. Moruth Doole, administrator of the prison planet of Kessel, believes that taking a tough stance on crime may win the hearts and minds of locals. This has yet to pay off, as the residents of Formos are as scandalized by geno­ cide and slavery as other inhabitants of the galaxy, and deeply resentful of the Empire’s rule as a result. A Hutt kingpin looking to make a name for himself offers the second, smaller bounty. In order to keep ahead of the bounty hunters on his trail, Bandin Dobah has arranged for the abduction of an R4 astromech droid with superlative programming relating to the local hyperspace routes and asteroid fields. He has also made contact with an experienced bounty hunter, a Rodian named Codon Netakka. For the time being, Dobah has managed to talk the bound­ ty hunter into abandoning his duty, but has not quite succeeded in his attempts to recruit him. While things are currently looking good for Dobah, circumstances are set to send him on a collision course with a band of adventurers. ADVENTURE SUMMARY The main plot of the adventure deals with the Player Characters coming to learn about the existence of Bandin Dobah and the trouble he is causing for the ragtag community of smugglers and fringers who make a living on Formos. They also discover that he has a sizable bounty on his head. The first part of the adventure deals with describing the Formos Spaceport and discussing some of the rea­ sons the PCs might visit it. Important areas and locations are described. There are some optional encounters that the GM can employ to give a little extra life to the sur­ roundings or develop into side plots should he wish to. The adventure really begins when the PCs decide to visit the local cantina. On their way, they discover a battered droid, wrecked beyond repair with only a few dwindling signs of function left. Fie is able to tell the PCs that a friend of his has been abducted, apparently on the orders of a local smuggling boss. At the cantina, the PCs learn more about the smuggler, a violent Aqualish named Bandin Dobah. They find out about the bounty on his head, and they may become entangled in a brawl. Whether the PCs intend it to or not, the brawl es­ calates into a violent confrontation with Daro Blunt, a smuggler who works as part of a network connected to Dobah. The PCs may find their way to Blunt’s safe house, where they are able to recover the missing droid. Several clues lead the PCs into discovering Dobah’s whereabouts, and help from NPCs and the promise of reward should encourage the PCs to hunt him down. This leads to a confrontation on a large asteroid within the Kessel Run itself, and the PCs could further enrich themselves by recovering contraband. If the PCs refuse to bring the smuggler to justice, Dobah nevertheless decides that they present a threat and comes looking for them. Should the PCs prevail, all that remains to them is to collect their reward, which could lead to a tense encoun­ ter with agents of the Empire or an ambitious Hutt. GET THE PCS INVOLVED In order to set the events of this scenario into motion, the PCs travel to the Formos Spaceport and make their way to a local cantina. As the adventuring party is likely to include characters who are at home within the gal­ axy’s underworld, this should be no great challenge. The best way to come up with a reason as to why the PCs are heading to the cantina is to consider the various Obligations they are under, then to utilize these in explain­ ing why the PCs are headed to Formos in the first place. As an example, a Smuggler PC might owe an Obliga­ tion to one of his contacts who has asked him to meet with someone in the cantina to facilitate the transfer of contraband. A Bounty Flunter PC might need to go to the cantina to meet someone who owes him credits, or may already be on the trail of smugglers in the area. Other thieves or criminals could be on the run and flee to Formos to escape Imperial or planetary justice (as law enforcement on the planet is exceedingly lax). If the party is newly created, perhaps their backstory could take into account the fact that they have assembled in the Formos Spaceport (which is exactly the sort of law­ less frontier territory in which such characters might meet). At the end of the day, the cantina is one of the few places on the planet where you can buy food and drink, so the PCs are sure to gravitate there given enough time. THE FORMOS SPACEPORT Formos is a forbidding world with few inhabitants. The climate is arid and much of the world is forbidding rocky desert shrouded by dusty, dark clouds. Were it not for its position at the junction of busy hyperspace routes, it is unlikely that anyone would choose to live there. While it is a terrestrial planet with a breathable atmosphere and standard gravity, life does not flour­ ish upon the world's dry surface. The only settlement of note is a hardscrabble spaceport with a reputation for shady deals and rough customers. The inhabitants of the Formos Spaceport are mostly human, though the place is quite cosmopolitan and many of the major spacefaring species can be found making a home here. Despite its grim reputation, the Formos Spaceport is famed among the smuggling community. It lies at the far end of the Kessel Run, a narrow corridor of navi­ gable space that snakes between the asteroid fields and black hole clusters that separate Formos from the prison planet Kessel. After the Kessel Run terminates in an asteroid-filled nebula known as the Pit, most pi­ lots proceed to Formos to link up with more defined hyperspace lanes to reach the wider galaxy. The mines of Kessel produce one of the most lucrative spices in the galaxy. This is glitterstim, a narcotic reported to in­ duce a telepathic high in those who use it. The Kessel Run is a risky route that must be made partially in hyperspace and partially in real space, and those who undertake it must evade constant Imperial patrols and dangerous black hole clusters. The smug­ glers who make the run, while they may be ruthless criminals in actual fact, have gained a reputation for defiant heroism in those quarters of the galaxy op­ posed to the rule of the Empire. Ultimately, there are two sides to life in the Formos Spaceport. On the one hand, it is a violent and lawless place, and on the other it is an icon to freedom fight­ ers. In such a place idealistic rebels, alien refugees, and manumitted droids rub shoulders with fugitive psycho­ paths and gangsters. The Empire has little presence on the planet, though a recently manned barracks hints of what might be in store for the lawless world's future. The spaceport consists of a large docking area for the storage of cargo and spaceships. This is surrounded by a ramshackle settlement of individual dwellings and ware­ houses. These are ugly and utilitarian buildings, blocky and gray like the crags of rock that dot the surface of Formos. A few traders have set up businesses in the spaceport selling foodstuffs, water, weapons, and the sort of equipment required by fringers, smugglers, and spacers. The sprawling streets are dotted with piles of crates, portable trash compactors, and vaporators. There are a few large and well-appointed buildings within the spaceport that aren't part of the docks or warehousing. One of these is a fortified building housing a group of Impe­ rial Army Troopers and the other is the Rii Jenks Cantina. IMPERIAL ARMY BARRACKS There is not much of an Imperial presence on Formos and the rather forlorn band of Imperial Army Troopers who are stationed on the planet are nothing more than a token gesture of force and authority. They are merely a reminder to the smugglers and fringers of the world that the Empire has eyes everywhere and could make matters much worse for them should it feel the need. As it is, the troopers and locals tend to steer clear of each other and allow business to go on as usual. There is an un­ spoken rule that a quiet toleration of each other is best for everyone. The troopers know that if they start leaning heav­ ily on the smuggling operations that go on throughout the Formos Spaceport, they may well have an insurrection to deal with, so they let the smugglers be. On the other hand, the locals know that if they were to attack the troopers, the Empire would probably arrange for a violent reprisal. And so, grudgingly, they tolerate them. Every once in a while the smuggling community of Formos lets it be known that a certain individual is proving a problem with everyone, and the troopers deal with them. This benefits the smug­ glers (who can tell any off-world contacts that the blame for shortcomings of service lies with the troopers) and it suits the troopers (who can point to the occasional arrests they make with the support of the smuggling community as evidence of their hard work and careful investigations). Every once in a while, a group of four troopers makes their way to the docks and gives a cursory glance at some of the incoming cargo, but they rarely trouble any of the smuggling operations going on. The PCs may see such a group making a patrol, but they won’t bother with the PCs unless members of the party interact with them or overtly commit some of­ fense. They will not get involved with the PCs unless the PCs bother them first. There are 18 Imperial Army Troopers in total, two of whom are squad sergeants. Each has access to ar­ mored clothing and breastplates, a blaster rifle, and two frag grenades. The barracks also has several heavier weapons, including a pair of E-Web heavy repeating blasters and an antiquated Atgar 1.4 FD P-Tower on the roof that theoretically can be used to shoot down illicit transports. THE Rll JENKS CANTINA While the forbidding planet and ramshackle spaceport might draw a poor report from visitors, the Rii Jenks Cantina is seen as something of a saving grace for For- mos. After all, even the most vicious of smuggling gangs like a place to kick back and relax after making the Kes- sel Run. Rii Jenks is a canny old Bith who makes a lucra­ tive living from selling food, drinks, and entertainment to weary space travelers. Fie is careful to make sure that threats to his business, such as Imperial agents and FHutt kingpins, are kept sweet with regular payments of bribes and information. Rii also stays on the right side of the smuggling community, offering them an effective safe house and storeroom and making sure none of the info­ mation he sells conflicts with the interests of smugglers. Like most cantinas on the rim, Rii Jenks’ establish­ meant draws a cosmopolitan crowd. He even welcomes droid customers in the knowledge that having a pro­ tocol unit or two in the place can help solve misun­ derstandings and disputes (and his prices for oil baths are nothing short of extortionate). Over the years, the cantina has served as the venue for some of the best up-and-coming musical acts of the Outer Rim. Currently in residence are Fia Mund, a Sullustan Kloo Horn player who is generating rave reviews, and a Xexto group playing raucous traditional Troiken percussion music, which is great if one has the taste for that sort of thing. LANDING ON FORMOS The Formos Spaceport is considered a Limited Set­ vices Port; it consists of a large area of duracrete upon which all but the heaviest of freighters can effect a safe landing. There is a small control tower and a number of sheds for docking, storage, and maintenance. The spaceport charges relatively small fees for landing and storing small or medium sized spacecraft, though a smuggler could probably arrange a further discount if he was able to make appropriate Charm checks. Once the PCs have disembarked from whatever vessel brought them to the planet, read the following to them: As soon as you set foot on the planet, you are instantly struck by the stale and parched atmo­ sphere of Formos. The air is breathable, but desic­ cated despite the cool climate. Most species begin to feel thirsty shortly after landing on the planet and those used to life on humid worlds soon feel dehydrated and uncomfortable. You notice that species with an aquatic heritage, such as Aqual- ish, Mon Calamari, and Herglic, are notably ab­ sent from those who make a home here. Thankfully, water sellers are a common sight pa­ trolling the streets and docks, though the prices they advertise would be considered extortionate on most habitable worlds. SOME OPTIONAL ENCOUNTERS In order to add some variety into the game, the following five short encounters can be added while the PCs wan­ der the streets of the spaceport. They have no relevance to the main plot or each other, so they are merely provid­ ed for the CM to employ as he chooses and to help the players appreciate that not everything that happens in the universe is directly tied to the events affecting them. These encounters do not need to take place at the begin­ ning of the adventure or in any particular order. However, it is recommended that the CM get them out of the way sooner rather than later so that they don't provide too much distraction from the action of the main plot. SMUGGLING OPERATION As the PCs make their way down one of the alleyways of the Formos Spaceport, have them all make an Easy (^) Perception check Those who pass the check notice that the earth to one side of a large warehouse bulges and shifts oddly. A second later a hole appears in the ground as a hidden trapdoor is opened, and a man’s head appears and looks around. He checks that there are no Imperial Army Troopers in the vicinity before ex­ iting the cellar along with two companions. They carry three large crates over to a speeder parked nearby. The driver of the speeder hands them some credit chips before flying off with the contraband toward the docks. The smugglers don’t much mind the PCs unless they are interrupted in their dealings, in which case they ask the PCs to mind their own business. If they are asked about smuggling or Bandin Dobah they claim ignorance, though they suggest that the PCs might be able to find out more by talking to the patrons of Rii Jenks’ Cantina. T R ITO N ITE MISSIONARY A lone member of the insectile Tritonite species has made his way to Formos to preach. Unfortunately for him, the locals have made it very clear that his message of peace and abstinence is not welcome and, as a result, he spends his days in quiet contemplation. That is unless he spots a strange face, such as that of a PC. On seeing a stranger, the Tritonite gibbers away in a series of clicks and whirrs incomprehensible to all but the best protocol droids. If he can be translated, the Tritonite insists that he has been inspired by the example of Holy Gac- timus to turn his back on all forms of vice and distraction, eschewing stimulants and entertainment, and has thus found an inner serenity more mind-blowing than any narcotic high. He offers the PCs a flexiplast tract that further extols on the benefits of following the example set by the obscure religious figure. THE CHEAPEST WATER SELLER ON FORMOS A heavily burdened and aging human woman stands by one of the busi­ er thoroughfares near the docks. She carries a plas­ tic water jug on her back and also hefts a large tray bearing a number of jars of water. She has |J erected a small sign nearby that reads "Mama Nobah— Cheapest Water on Formos,” and indeed her prices are far more reasonable than any other water sellers the PCs see in the vicin­ ity. Mama Nobah is a charming old lady, with a keen and friendly interest in the PCs. She gossips with them about their adventures and aspirations and offers them any directions or advice they might need during their visit. She also has a sob story, claiming to have once been a resident of Alderaan who only escaped its destruction by the Death Star due to a fortuitous, but fruitless, business trip to Corellia. Mama Nobah is not as benign as she seems. While she natters to the PCs, her son Jok Nobah attempts to creep up on them to steal whatever he can lift. He chooses one of the PCs to steal from and unless the PC passes a Per­ ception check opposed by Jok Nobah's Cunning of 3, he loses any small and accessible items of equipment, or some of the credits that he carries. Should any of the PCs announce that they are keeping an eye out while talking to Mama Nobah, her son errs on the side of caution and leaves them unmolested. If the PCs apprehend the thief, Mama Nobah begs their forgiveness, repeating that their desperate situation is the result of Imperial tyranny and offering free water by way of compensation. If the PCs insist on rough justice, Mama Nobah and her son use the Spaceport Urchin profile on page 399 (although they are minions, they are not treated as a group). VREEBO GANGO—RODIAN, WALLFLOWER Vreebo is a young Rodian and a member of a small smuggling gang that has recently arrived on Formos. His colleagues have tasked him with making contact with another gang of smugglers, who they expect to arrive at around the same time the PCs land on Formos. Why the smugglers have decided to task Vreebo with mak­ ing contact is not clear, because while he is an ex­ pert when it comes to piloting a vessel through dangerous hyperspace corridors, the Rodian is painfully shy with strangers. When Vreebo sees the PCs at the space­ port, he assumes that they are his contacts because the smuggling gang is of a similar size and composition as the party. However, he isn’t sure and doesn’t wish to make a fool of himself while finding out. As such, he decides to shadow the party for a while in order to make sure he hasn’t made a mistake (which, of course, he has). Vreebo will follow the PCs at a distance but does not bother them, deciding after a while that they aren’t his contacts after all. During this time, if any of the PCs men­ tions that he is keeping an eye out for people who might be following them or eavesdropping, he notices Vreebo on an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Perception check If Vreebo is asked what he wants he gives a very flustered, stammer­ ing account of expecting to meet some “business con­ tacts." If he is questioned further, he becomes even more bashful, barely able to speak, breaking into a sweat and flushing a deep green color. The PCs may suspect him of being Godon Netakka, though he looks far too frail and nervous to make a career of bounty hunting and his only weapon is a hidden holdout blaster. LEI M U O R O Y -A YOUNG BANDIT ON THE MAKE This encounter presents a red herring to the adventur­ ers, and should therefore be used sparingly. Lei Muoroy is a young human male who is running short on credits. As such, he has taken the risky decision of pretending to be a member of Bandin Dobah's smuggling network, and is running an extortion racket. The PCs may encoun­ ter Lei menacing an easy target, such as a lone water seller. Lei’s sales pitch runs along the lines of a growled “I'm here to collect a cut for the Big Man around these parts, know what I mean? That'll be twenty credits if you know what’s good for you, plus five extra for the trouble. ’’ If the PCs confront Lei, he tries to intimidate them with more talk of the "Big Man” (which is how many locals have begun to refer to Bandin Dobah), but if the PCs don’t back down at this, he attempts to make a break for it. The fact is that Lei has no con­ nection to Bandin Dobah and his antics would cer­ tainly earn the extreme displeasure of the Aqualish, who has enough of a code of honor not to wish to be seen dealing in small time extortion. However, inter­ rogating Lei may provide the PCs with some help if they are looking for Daro’s safe house, as the young crook knows where it is. As such, it is best to wait until the PCs have visited the cantina before they en­ counter Lei. If the GM needs a profile for Lei Muoroy, use the Street Tough profile on page 396, armed with just the truncheon and blaster pistol. BECOMING EMBROILED W hile the PCs should be able to enjoy a few optional w e n co u n te rs, they are certain to become tangled up in the events of the plot before long. THE SAD FATE OF J9-B8 This encounter occurs as the PCs are journeying to the Rii Jenks Cantina from their lodgings or space­ craft. As they approach the cantina, read the follow­ ing out loud to the players: The disorderly jumble o f hastily constructed dwellings around the cantina makes for a maze of tight alleyways filled with all manner of obstruc­ tion. Portable trash compactors, piles o f crates, and personal moisture condensers line the gang­ ways that thread between houses and shops. As you pass a particularly dark and narrow alley- way nestled between a pair o f towering warehous­ es, you hear a commotion. There is a loud rattle and a buzzing noise coming from within the alley. The rattling stops, and you hear a low and monotonous voice calling out. The voice is buzzing and faint, but you can still hear; "HelloI Bzzzt! Help pleazzze! I need help!" The noises seem to come from a large blue trash compactor next to one of the warehouses. If the PCs peer inside, they see that, among the various rubbish and junk, there is a badly damaged droid. Its head has been dented, one of its eyes has been smashed, its body has been pulled apart, and all manner of wiring, hydraulics, and hardware are strewn about in the trash compactor. The Droid is J9-B8, a variant of the 3PO protocol droid made by Cybot Calactica. J9-B8 provided long service to his old master who, wishing to make a point to squabbling relatives, had her droids manumitted on her deathbed (i.e. provided the right not to serve any master save themselves). As a free droid, J9- B8 toured the Outer Rim with his companion R4- W9, an astromech who had been employed by the same master. The woman who had owned J9-B8 and R4-W9 was a successful smuggler before her death, and the R4 unit was one of the few in the area able to perform a truly comprehensive navigational analysis of the Kessel Run. Unfortunately R4-W9's precious knowledge has led to J9-B8’s cur­ rent perilous state. The two droids were making their way to the cantina when they were waylaid by thugs. These agents of Bandin Dobah wrecked J9-B8 and left him for dead. They then fitted a restraining bolt to R4-W9, overriding his manumission, and delivered him to their boss. Note that J9-B8 has a monotone voice and a speech impediment that renders sibilant sounds as a buzzing noise; this is a shortcoming of the J9’s Verpine manufacture made worse by the damage the droid has sustained. On seeing the PCs, J9-B8 stops calling for help. There are a couple of whirring noises and his head shudders as he speaks. "Ah! Bzzzt! Greetingzzz! Zzzo glad you f-found me! Pleazzze help! Bzzzt! They took my f-friend! Pleazzze help zzzove R4-W9! Zzzzzbxzzzz!" J9-B8 responds to any questions the PCs have at this point, though he is keen to tell them about R4- W9 quickly. He is aware that he does not have much time left as his self-repair mechanisms have done all they can. J9-B8 is totally beyond repair. Even charac­ ters who attempt to fix him using the Mechanics skill are unable to achieve anything other than affording him a little comfort in his last moments. If the PCs are willing to listen, J9-B8 says the following: "My friend R4-W9 and I were on our way to the can­ tina when we were zzzet upon by a band o f th-th- thugzzz! Zzzbxzzt! They tore me apart with barzzz and dragged him away! Pleazzze! It izzz too late to do anyzzzing f-f-for me but zzzave my friend!" At this point the remaining lights in the wreckage of J9- B8’s body begin to dim and his voice drops an octave. He continues to speak for a further minute and gives a few more details about the attack, but he becomes ever more incoherent and unresponsive as he does so. J9-B8 can provide the PCs with any information about his background that he thinks they might use. He also tells them that R4-W9 was prized among the local smug­ glers due to his knowledge of the Kessel Run. He knows that the attack occurred about 20 hours ago, though he isn’t exactly sure as it has taken a long time to get his limited systems back online. He thinks the band who attacked him were mostly human, though they were wearing hoods. He believes that his attackers were all male. He saw that they fitted a restraining bolt to R4-W9 before dragging him away. He does not know any of the attackers but suspects they have something to do with an Aqualish named Bandin Dobah who has become no­ torious in recent months for muscling in on a number of smuggling operations along the Kessel Run. No one else is in the immediate vicinity. If members of the motley community of fringers who make their dwellings nearby are asked about the attack, they complain that there are fights all the time and little at­ tension is paid to them. If quizzed harder, a local may recall that there was some commotion by the ware­ houses the previous day, but he won’t have any details. AT THE CANTINA The Rii Jenks Cantina is fairly busy, with a varied clien­ tele. Read the following out to the players as they en­ ter the cantina: As you enter the lobby o f the cantina, you are aware o f a change in atmosphere. The a ir condi­ tioning alone is almost as refreshing as the never­ ages served a t the well-appointed bar promise to be. The cantina is clearly a popular spot for locals to mix, though it isn't so crowded as to make it impossible for you to get seats. All manner o f hu­ mans and aliens rub shoulders at the bar, and they even seem happy to let droids in. To your right, a flickering holoscreen displays the rotating head o f a tough-looking adult male Aqualish, with scrolling text advertising an Imperial bounty. The cantina consists o f two levels, the main level with the bar, and a circular balcony level above, with semi-private booths. The balcony is not too high above the first floor, making the whole ar­ rangement feel more intimate and closed than its size would suggest. To one side of the cantina, the balcony is broken by a raised stage upon which Fia Mund, billed as the Sullustan master of the Kloo Horn, plays his instrument. His playing is es­ sentially freeform jatz incorporating a surprising baka rock influence. It shouldn’t really work, but he makes something fresh of it and generally receives an approving response from the audience. The clientele consists of humans (who make up at least three quarters of the cantina's patrons), Deva- ronians, Duros, and droids (one of whom is a proto­ col droid employed by the cantina to interpret for customers who speak different languages). A pair of courting Twi’leks sit in one corner (apparently rather wrapped up in one another) and a garrulous Toydar- ian flutters near the bar discussing a dubious business venture with a figure dressed in a huge and envelop­ ing red hooded cloak. Talk in the cantina revolves around fairly mundane matters. Even though Rii Jenks’ is considered a haven for smugglers, those in the bar are not so stupid as to discuss business in such an open forum. Neverthe­ less, the clientele do not appreciate snoops and the PCs (especially droids) are best advised to keep from eavesdropping. Most of the conversation revolves around personal matters and irrelevant gossip. Near the door to the cantina is a board displaying a holoscreen message that may well be of interest to the PCs. It shows the slowly revolving 3D head of an aging and grizzled Aqualish with a bounty notice. If the PCs ask questions about Bandin Dobah, miss­ ing droids, or smuggling gangs, they are met with a paranoid attitude. The drinkers in the bar are not so careless as to discuss such things in public and won’t be shy about telling the PCs so. A typical response runs along the lines of: "Shhh! Are you crazy? Look, you people ought to get to know your way around before you start assume­ ing that I know o f such things just because I happen to live on Formos—understood? Oh look, I can see that you’re new here, so why don’t you grab a drink for yourselves and relax. Enjoy the music for a bit. ” The PCs may feel at a dead end after such a rebuff, but after the exchange it only takes a brief moment before one of the Devaronians approaches the PCs and offers to "explain some matters.” This is Snoo, an information broker. Fie is happy to take one of the PCs aside (not a droid or anyone carrying much equip­ meant; he is not willing to be recorded—though if it happens that all the party are droids, he will choose the most human looking to talk to). Fie is willing to explain a bit about the recent events in the area if the PC can do a little favor to loosen his tongue. His price begins at 50 credits, but he can be bargained down to 20 if the PC he is talking to passes an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Charm, Coercion, or Deception check. The information he imparts —depending on the sort of questions he is asked—con­ sists of the following: • Formos is a great place to do business if you know much about bounty hunting or han­ dling contraband—but people won’t just offer jobs to strang­ ers. Prospective smugglers have to earn some respect and trust within the community before ex­ pecting to make useful contacts. • Bandin Dobah is the head of an organized smuggling ring that operates on a loose fran­ chise basis. The ring is said to be made up of many cells that rely on each other for mutual support and information. Bandin Dobah heads the cell at the top of the hierarchy, and takes a cut of the profits made by the other cells. In return they can rely on the fearsome rep­ utation Bandin Dobah enjoys and the increased job opportunities that his organization provides. A typical cell is made up of four to ten smugglers. • Nothing has been said about a droidnapping, but it would be well within the character of Bandin Dobah to arrange for such a thing. • The Empire's bounty is not the only one on Bandin Dobah’s head. Thakba Besadii Diori, a Hutt kingpin of Sleheyron, has also offered 5,000 credits for his capture, and many bounty hunters would rather chase this reward than sully their hands with Im­ perial blood money. However, the Hutt wishes to make an example of Dobah, so he is only offering the full reward if the Aqualish is delivered alive. • As of yet, few people have made serious attempts to accost Bandin Dobah. Some weeks back, a Ro- dian bounty hunter appeared in the cantina and it was generally assumed that he was on the trail. He hasn’t been heard from since. Snoo knows nothing else pertinent, and his reputation as a reliable source of information is too important for him to offer idle speculation or outright fiction even if he is of­ fered more money or otherwise pumped for information. ZUKATA'S WOES Just as the interview with the Devaronian information broker ends, some more people enter the cantina. The first of these is an elegant Rodian girl who heads directly for the bar and orders herself some food and drink. She draws appreciative glances from those in the cantina who notice attractive Rodian girls. She wears a loose blouse of green satin with polished brass accessories, and while she seems unarmed, her purse is shaped so as to conceivably contain a hold­ out blaster. This is Zukata, who has recently arrived from Rodia in search of her missing brother. Bare moments after the Rodian enters the bar, three smugglers saunter through the doors. Two of the smugglers are human males and the third is a We- equay. The three are all tough-looking customers who bear themselves with swaggering arrogance. A gener­ al hush falls over the patrons of the cantina. Even Fia Mund hits a few bum notes and has to take a pause for breath before resuming his performance. The reason for the change in atmosphere is of course that the smugglers are rumored to belong to Bandin Dobah's organization, though no one would say such a thing while they are in the room. The three individuals are as follows. Note that al­ though Spir and Gut are minions, they are not intend­ ed to work as a group. This encounter isn’t supposed to be very difficult for the PCs. DARO BLUNT-SMUGGLING GANG LEADER (RIVAL) Daro Blunt has unkempt hair with three days of stub­ ble growing from his gaunt face. This human wears a dirty beige flight suit and a holstered blaster pistol on each hip. Daro also carries a backpack that looks like it contains some weighty bits of equipment. BOUNTY NOTICE The office of Moruth Doole, administrator of the spice mines of Kessel, is offering a 10,000 credit reward for the killing or capture of the Aqualish pirate Bandin Dobah This danger­ ous outlaw from Imperial justice is guilty of the murder of the Empire's security operatives, destruction of the Empire’s property, move­ meant of contraband, black marketeering of narcotics, and acts of criminal conspiracy. For more information, contact any local repre­ sentatives of Imperial authority. Skills: Coercion 1, Cool 1, Ranged (Light) 3. Talents: None. Abilities: Daro duel wields his blaster pistols, follow­ ing the rules for two-weapon combat on page 210. Equipment: Two modified quick-draw blaster pistols (Ranged [Light]; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Me­ dium]; Stun setting, may be drawn as an incidental), heavy clothing (+ 1 soak). SPIR FRAXIS—SMUGGLER (MINION) Spir is a rangy young man with furtive eyes. His upper lip has been split and still bears a long lurid scar, which may explain why he seems to leer at anyone whose eye he catches. Spir has dressed up to visit the cantina in neatly tailored and close-fitting black clothing. Skills: None. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Heavy blaster pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 7; Critical 3; Range [Medium]; Stun setting). GUT-GURO-WEEQUAY (MINION) Gut-Guro’s age is hard to estimate as he has the same ruddy and wrinkled features common to most mem­ bers of his species. He wears his hair in three long braids and dresses in the rough quilted leather that serves as traditional Weequay garb. Skills: None. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Vibroknife (Melee; Damage 4; Critical 2; Range [Engaged]; Pierce 2, Vicious I ), padded ar­ more ( + 2 soak). The three approach the bar and order stiff drinks. Spir is almost instantly taken with Zukata, and after giving her an appreciative leer he sidles up to her. Anyone keeping an eye on the interaction is able to tell from her body language that Spir makes her uncomfortable, if his attitude isn’t a clue. Unless the PCs intervene, Spir attempts to chat Zukata up in an extremely unctuous manner; using lines such as, "Well you don't see many pretty Rodian girls in this place. What's that you're drinking, baby? Hey Rii! Let's have another one o f those over here, will you?" She is clearly uncomfortable with such at­ tension, but lacks the confidence to forcefully request that he leave her alone. She mutters some polite but restrained rejection to him in Rodian. Spir ignores her discomfort. He can’t understand Rodian anyway. If the PCs still don’t show any interest, Spir begins to brag more loudly, saying the following. "Hey, you ought to show o little more apprecia­ tion, baby. This ain't some scuzzy scrap dealer of­ fering you company. I'm an important guy around these parts, yeah? You be a bit more friendly and i t ’ll be to your advantage, yeah?" Now Zukata is keen to get away, and looks implor­ ing around the bar to see if she can find some reason to excuse herself. Hopefully the PCs have made some sort of effort to dissuade Spir by this point, but if they haven’t, she finds a pretext for talking to them. For example, she approaches a Rodian or droid PC asking if they can translate for her, or strikes up a conversa­ tion with a female PC in the hopes of some support. Whether the PCs intervene or whether Zukata ap­ proaches them, Spir sees them as a frustrating ob­ stacle and subjects them to verbal abuse. "Hey bach o ff will you. us two are getting to know one another. Mind your own business if you know what's good for you. yeah?" If the PCs meet Spir with violence or abuse of their own he is happy to start a fight. How the situation develops depends on the PCs’ response. • PCs keep cool and are polite to Spir: In this situation, he subjects them to a few more insults and then loses his nerve. “You scuzzy bums ought to be more careful about who you offend, but this ain't worth my time." The three smugglers finish their drinks and leave the bar. • PCs engage in verbal sparring: If a PC bandies harsh words with Spir and passes a Coercion check opposed by Discipline, Spir loses his nerve as out­ lined above. If the PC fails the test, Spir matches insult for insult and escalates things into a fist fight, if possible, by throwing a punch at the nearest PC. • PCs engage in fist fight: Gut backs Spir up, but Daro leaves the cantina. Spir and the Weequay fight the PCs until either one of them is incapacitated. At this point, they break off and follow Daro. Other cantina patrons take cover and hope for the best. • PCs turn weapons on Spir: Daro and Gut back Spir, but Daro stays near the door and flees if ei­ ther is incapacitated or killed. Other NPCs react as described above. Whatever occurs at this juncture, the GM should ensure that Daro escapes with no more than minor injuries and that Zukata suffers no harm. At this point, Zukata thanks the PCs profusely. "Thank you for dealing with him. If there is some way I could repay you I would be happy to do you a favor I have a little money—perhaps you would like some food and drink?” Zukata is happy enough to leave the conversation here if the PCs don’t wish to talk. However, if they ask her what she is doing on Formos, she complains that she has been tasked with verifying the accuracy of an updated electronic atlas of the galaxy to be produced on Rodia, taking her to all sorts of backwater worlds. Zukata is fairly bored and frustrated with her predica­ meant, and willing to engage in any of the following topics the PCs bring up. • We have heard of a droid with comprehensive data about the Kessel Run. "Is that R4-W9? Yes, I have heard o f him also. Part o f the reason I am here was in the hope of tracking him down." Zukata goes on to explain that she would very much like to offer the droid or its owner a reward of 2,000 credits if the information he holds is ac­ curate and he is willing to share it. • This atlas— it wouldn’t be anything to do with bounty hunting, would it? "Well, yes. The organization I am working for plans to produce a series o f products, atlases, navigation units, upgrades for droids, and so on. These would be aimed a t providing Rodian bounty hunters with pertinent information about areas o f the galaxy favored by outlaws and criminals." • We have heard of a Rodian bounty hunter on the trail of Bandin Dobah. "Indeed. I know of him, not personally but by reputation. Godon Ne- takka is his name. He is a reckless young man, and he got himself into a lot o f debt buying the equip­ meant needed to make a serious go o f bounty hunt­ ing. His clanspeople are very worried about him. " • We heard he went after Bandin Dobah and hasn’t been heard from since. Do you think he’s dead? “He might be. But sometimes a hunt­ er engages in what we c a ll'padding." On locating their quarry, they deliberately delay the capture in the hopes that the price on his head increases while the quarry remains a t large. Personally, I think it can be a clever ploy, but to many bounty hunters it's considered taboo. Godon might be dead, but he might just be padding, waiting for Dobah’s bounty to go up." way or window. If the check is failed, the PCs have been spotted by a member of the gang who raises the alarm; see Confronting Daro’s Gang on page 428 for further information. If this check is passed, the following snippet of con­ versation can be heard: Dam's gruff voice speaks first. "I mean, I want, to pay them back for Spir anyhow, but are you sure it's anything that should be of concern to the Big Many" The Toydarian sounds somewhat unctuous "I couldn't be sure, but it seems that they are mixed in with things somehow. They're new in town. Been asking questions. Checking the bounty no­ tice. I thought I heard them say something about a missing droid, but I could be wrong. They were getting themselves pretty cozy with the Rodian girl as well, if you know what I mean." Daro grunts. "It's good you let us know. Here, a token of appreciation." It is fairly obvious that Zukata is being coy with explaining her relationship to Godon Netakka. If the PCs press her, she reveals that Godon is her brother, and she wants to see him back safely. She doesn't have any additional money to offer, but would be pro­ foundly grateful if this happened, and makes it clear she’d owe the person responsible a huge favor. As the conversation with Zukata finishes, the PCs should all make Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Perception checks. Those who succeed notice that the Toydarian (whose name, if it comes up, is Zalg) who was previously at the bar has hovered toward them and seems to be eavesdropping in on their conversation. If he is spotted, he gives the PCs a broad tusk-filled grin before heading toward the exit. He is intending to track down Daro Blunt and offer to tell him all he knows about the PCs—and any interest in Bandin Dobah that they have shown—for a handful of credits. If the PCs accost the Toydarian he pretends inno­ cence, explaining that he had too much to drink and needed to leave. SHADOWING THE SPY Should the PCs decide to fol­ low the Toydarian, they should make an Aver­ age Stealth check. If this check is failed, the Toydarian spots them and flutters down a side alley. The PCs have to make an Average Perception check in order to keep him within their sights. If they still keep on his trail, he rounds on them, accusing them of planning to rob him. He insists,1^ as before, that he is just going home and, if the PCs still press the mat­ ter, he does actually head back to his own house. He waits there for half an hour before going to fin d Daro Blunt again and, if the PCs are still shadowing' him, he leads them to a warehouse used by the smug­ glers as a safe house. If the Toydarian reaches the warehouse, he is admit­ ted inside and begins to deal with Daro (or the next highest ranking smuggler if Daro is dead). Any PC who wishes to eavesdrop should make an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Stealth check in order to sneak up to a suitable door­ If the PCs take no ac­ tion, then the Toydar­ ian is paid 20 credits and flutters back to his home. In the meantime, Daro musters the rest of his gang and heads out look­ ing for the PCs. Daro’s gang consists of him­ self, Spir, Cut (if they have not been killed), I one additional Smuggler (see page 396), and a group of three Street Toughs armed with slugth- 'ower rifles (see page 396). If Spir and Gut have, been killed and the PCs have a group of four or more, the GM can add one addi­ tional Smuggler to the fight. The Street Toughs fight as a group, while Spir and Cut do not. The smuggler hideout also has a small weapons stockpile. If they have sufficient warning (if they know they are going to ambush the PCs or have pri­ or warning the PCs are going to attack) they have a heavy blaster rifle with an attached Galactic Arms XA Classic Bipod (decrease the weapon’s Cumber- some rating by 2 when the weapon is braced against something or the user is prone) and six stun gre­ nades. The Street Toughs take the stun grenades, and the Smuggler takes the heavy blaster rifle (trad­ ing skill for firepower). The Toydarian is unarmed and unwilling to fight. If he is attacked, he does all he can to disengage and flutter off. CONFRONTING DARO'S GANG The PCs eventually have to confront Daro and his gang. This either happens at the gang’s safe house (if they seized the initiative by following gang members there or asking directions) or on the street. The PCs can garner a significant advantage if they tackle the gang at the safe house. If they do so, the gang has not had the time to equip themselves with any extra gear from their arm ory or take any advantageous positions. If the PCs do not track down the safe house, the gang gathers gear and heads toward the cantina. This occurs roughly half an hour after the Toydarian leaves Rii Jenks’. The gang takes up positions and waits out­ side the cantina for the PCs. They prepare to shoot them down in the street and carefully position them­ selves behind portable trash compactors and other likely sources of cover. If the PCs have left the cantina by this point, the gang begins to search the spaceport with the inten­ tion of accosting them in the street. In this situation the PCs might be able to spot the gang before they are seen themselves, if a member of the party passes a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Perception check The gang does not initially fight with the intention of killing all the PCs. They seek to send a message and know that in order to do so, they need to leave a few witnesses. With this in mind, they spend one round merely letting off warning shots while Daro says: "Look, you idiots clearly have no idea who you're dealing with. Drop your weapons and we’ll go easy on you. “ If the PCs capitulate at this point, they receive a se­ vere beating (they suffer enough strain to incapacitate them) and are told to keep their noses out of Daro’s business in the future. Without mentioning Bandin Dobah’s name, Daro explains that he and his friends are part of a "self-supporting network of dealers in portable goods" and that there are "a whole bunch of us about these parts," so the PCs should count them­ selves lucky that they are being left with just a beating. If the PCs press matters, the gang starts to fight in earnest, concentrating their fire on the PCs who present the biggest threats. Daro shouts to his allies to kill them. The gang fights ferociously until their leadership is killed or otherwise taken out of the action. This leadership consists of Daro and Cut. Once both of these smugglers become casualties, the rest of the gang beats a hasty retreat, trying to lose any pursuit in the maze of alleyways that riddle the spaceport. If the PCs are silly enough to surrender at any point, the gang executes one or two of them to avenge any damage they have suffered themselves before giving the survivors the warning about their friend the Big Man and his network. If Daro dies, the PCs' attention is drawn to the bulky backpack he wears. Inside they find a med- pac, two stimpacks, 50 credits, and a bulky piece of equipment that looks like a large dark iron span­ ner. This is a tool used for fitting restraining bolts to droids, and any PC trained in Mechanics automati­ cally recognizes it. (If nobody is trained in Mechan­ ics, the CM should select one PC). Once the PCs have seen off the gang (or once they have surrendered their weapons and received what­ ever rough justice the gang has seen fit to mete out) a few local fringers approach the PCs. They treat the PCs as heroes if they fought off the gang or commiser­ ate with them if they were beaten. The fringers explain a few facts about the gang, say­ ing that they are suspected of working within a thug- gish smuggling ring, and probably linked to Bandin Dobah. If the PCs have not already been there, the fringers tell them the address of the gang’s safe house. THE GANG'S SAFE HOUSE The safe house is an old warehouse that has been briskly refurbished to suit the gang’s needs. If can be opened with one of the keys from Daro’s backpack. It is essentially a single large room with an area by one wall for relaxation. A number of salvaged couch­ es and hammocks provide some comfort to resting smugglers. There is also an old fashioned stove and larder for preparing snacks, as well as a stinking chemical toilet. A large reinforced steel cabinet sits in one corner of the room and can be opened using another of Daro’s keys. The cabinet contains an assortment of various tools and 255 credits. If they didn’t have time to get them, the gang’s additional weapons can also be found here. The center of the room is piled with all manner of crates and boxes, though the gang has not taken a shipment of contraband for some time and they are empty of anything of value. They could be pressed into service as cover in case of a firefight, however. An inactive astromech droid, R4-W9, stands in an­ other corner. He shows some signs of mistreatment. His chassis is covered in oily handprints and dents. He has had a large dark iron restraining bolt fitted to his chassis. Some of the small panels on the front of the droid have been removed and he has been wired to a small portable computer. The blinking green screen on the computer reads "Configuration complete—co­ ordinates compatible." The droid remains unresponsive while the restrain­ ing bolt is in place. Any PC with the Mechanics or Computers skill can immediately tell that the restrain­ ing bolt keeps him inactive. The bolt can be removed using the tool found in Daro’s backpack. Alternatively, a PC could remove it on an Average Mechan­ ics check or force it off using a tool as a lever. If he fails the Mechanics check or forces off the bolt, the droid takes three wounds. R4-W9 is glad to be freed from the restraining bolt. Like most astromechs, he communicates in bleeping machine language, though he carries a holographic projector that he can use to display relevant images in order to illustrate any point he wishes to make. R4- W9’s immediate concern is to find out what became of his companion, J9-B8, and he emits a mournful series of bloops and moans if told of his friend’s death. He then explains to the PCs that he has been up­ loaded with a set of coordinates corresponding to a field of large asteroids that lies not far from Formos and could be reached quickly by a craft with hyper­ space capabilities. STREET FIGHTING T he streets and alleyways of the Formos Space­ port are littered with all manner of discarded crates and packaging, as well as vaporators and trash compactors. Should any sort of fight break out, characters are able to make use of such items for cover, or are able to climb on them to enjoy a better view of the area. If a fight breaks out on the streets at any time, characters are never any further than medium range from a pile of crates, and no more than long range from either access to a roof, the cor­ ner of a building, or a trash compactor. The crates provide basic cover (+1 defense), while the trash compactor or the corner of a building provides better cover ( + 2 defense). A character who stands on top of a trash compac­ tor or gains access to a rooftop is better able to draw a bead on any enemies. Add ■ to any shooting attacks made on characters below. if a PC examines the computer attached to R4-W9, its contents can be accessed by passing an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Computers check If the PC passes the test, he can tell that the computer contains a few programs be­ side the coordinates that have recently been uploaded to the astromech. Most of these are accounts of glit- terstim bales transported and sold. If he scores at least o o o the CM should spend it to give him access to an additional file. This file is named “Pass" and seems to be a pattern for a short wave radio signal designed to be broadcast by a ship’s navigational computer. R4-W9—ASTROMECH DROID TRIVALl Skills: Astrogation 3, Computers 3, Cool i , Mechan­ ics 2, Piloting (Space) 2. Talents: None. Abilities: Droid (Does not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and can survive in vacuum or underwater. Im­ mune to poisons or toxins.). Equipment: Arc welder (Melee; Damage 3; Critical Range [Engaged]; Stun Damage), built-in repair tools (counts as tool kit). NOW WHAT? The PCs may have enough motivation to track down Bandin Dobah and bring him to justice under their own steam, in which case R4-W9 offers to join them and help in any way that he can. If the PCs are at a loss as to what to do at this junc­ true, R4-W9 explains that they ought to consider tackling the Aqualish. He can make any of the follow­ ing points. When doing so, however, the GM should remember that R4 is not merely the CM’s mouth­ piece, nor is he just going to spout off each reason in turn until something sticks. His primary motivation is revenge against Bandin, and he sees the PCs as the best option for making it happen (the best move for the GM is to pick the reason he thinks most likely to resonate with his group and present it, resorting to other reasons only if need be, or ideally letting the players come up with the other reasons themselves). • Word soon gets around that the PCs have fought and killed members of Bandin Dobah’s organiza­ tion, and the Aqualish will surely take some form of reprisal in order to ensure his reputation. • The best time to take action against Dobah is surely as soon as possible. After all, they know where the Aqualish is likely to be found and can launch a surprise attack. • If R4-W9 has been informed of the Rodian bound­ ty hunter, he argues that Dobah may have had to deal with him recently and could therefore be weakened and in need of reinforcement. • R4-W9 makes a moral point, saying that Dobah and his goons clearly have much of the local smuggling community intimidated, and have killed perfectly good droids in order to secure their position. He states that the PCs would be doing a good thing to avenge J9-B8. • 10,000 credits is a good deal of money and there may be additional prizes to be won from search­ ing the ship, such as boxes of contraband. If the PCs still aren’t interested in taking on Bandin Dobah, then R4-W9 thanks them again for releasing him but does not wish to accompany them any fur­ ther. Instead, he disappears into the alleyways of the Formos Spaceport to plot his own revenge on Dobah. The PCs now have two choices: they can either take the initiative and search out Bandin Dobah, which in­ volves a dangerous journey to a nearby asteroid, or they can refuse the quest and amuse themselves on Formos. If they do the latter, its up to the GM whether the Aqual­ ish tracks them down or not. If the GM chooses that route, the profiles and combat information for Bandin and his gang can be found later in this chapter, and the GM should keep in mind that they show up prepared for a serious fight and not willing to take chances. TRACKING DOWN DOBAH The journey from Formos to the asteroid field is only a short hyperspace trip, and for the most part it is com­ pletely routine and uneventful. As a rough estimate, the PCs are able to make the journey and return to Formos within about twenty hours provided they don’t get lost or waylaid. Read the following out to the players: R4-W9 is able to assist the pilot of the ship to safely drop out o f hyperspace within a short distance of the asteroid field. From there, the ship's navigation­ al computer, together with some assistance from R4-W9, can locate the position o f a large, slowly drifting asteroid. The droid identihes this rock as the likely location o f Bandin Dobah’s hideout. This asteroid has been riddled with caverns left by massive space slugs. There seem to be many entrances to the asteroid's interior, and scans show that a number o f large caverns have been gnawed out o f the rock. Should the PCs attempt to glean more information about the asteroid from their navigational computer or sensor array, it takes an Easy (^ ) Computers check If the PCs pass the test, they discover that scans of the rock indicate the following: • Life forms can be detected in two of the caverns (B and C on the map). • Large metallic objects giving energy readouts are detected in two of the caverns, and these are likely spacecraft (A and C on the map). • A smaller metallic object can be detected in orbit around the asteroid, and is probably some sort of sentry droid. There is also another heat spot on the surface, possibly a starship on standby. SENTRY DROID AND Z-TIE The Sentry Droid is a small drone spacecraft tasked with orbiting the asteroid and monitoring the surround­ ing area for incoming vessels or other hazards. It is pro­ grammed to alert Bandin Dobah if it identifies a likely hazard, then intercept it. The Sentry Droid is a small spacecraft managed by a droid brain with the following characteristics and skills. The droid brain is a part of the spacecraft, so does not have soak or wound thresholds, or any equipment or abilities. If it ever needs to suffer strain, the ship suffers system strain instead. It ignores any wounds. SENTRY DROID PROFILE Skills: Gunnery 2, Piloting (Space) 2 Talents: None SENTRY DROID STARSHIP PROFILE Vehicle Type/Model: Starfighter/Custom. Manufacturer: Unknown. Hyperdrive: None. Navicomputer: None. Ship’s Complement: None, droid operated. Encumbrance Capacity: - Passenger Capacity: - Consumables: - Cost: Unknown. Sensor Range: Medium. Weapons: Forward Mounted Twin Light Laser Can­ nons (Fire Arc Forward; Range Close; Damage 5; Criti­ cal Hit 3; Linked 1). The Sentry Droid takes 20 minutes to orbit the as­ teroid. Each turn it makes a scanner sweep to locate any likely hazards. To work out the results of such a sweep, make an Average Computers check each turn while something of interest (such as the PCs' ship) is within medium range of the droid. If the droid detects a spaceship, it requests identification. Without clearance, the droid alerts Bandin Dobah and the smuggler manning the Z-TIE that a hostile craft has arrived at the end of the round, then attacks. If the sentry droid receives an appropriate response, it stands down and allows the droid or vessel to con­ tinue. It sends another message to Bandin Dobah in­ forming him that the incoming vessel is friendly. Z-TIE The Z-TIE is a starfighter colloquially known as an “ugly”—an amalgamation of salvaged snubfighter parts reconstructed into a single starfighter. The Z-TIE is a cross between a Z-95 Headhunter and a TIE fight­ er. At some point, one of Dobah’s smugglers salvaged the chassis of a partially destroyed Z-95, replacing the shredded wings with a TIE fighter's distinctive hexagonal solar panels. He also replaced one of the concussion missile tubes in the Z-95 with a laser can­ non. He’s kept the other concussion missile launcher, although he only has a single missile for it. Now the smuggler, Alger Sodoth (see page 596) has the tedious job of providing backup for the droid in case of a problem. Dobah doesn’t quite trust the droid, so he’s erected a small pressure-shed in one of the asteroid’s smaller caves, where he’s stashed the Z-TIE. Sodoth’s on duty but relaxing when the PCs arrive. Z-TIE PROFILE Hull Type: Starfighter. Ship Class: Ugly. Manufacturer: Scavenged. Hyperdrive: None. Navicomputer: None. Ship’s Complement: One pilot. Encumbrance Capacity: 8 . Passenger Capacity: None. Consumables: One day. Cost: Unknown. Sensor Range: Short. Weapons: Forward Mounted Laser Cannon (Fire Arc Forward; Damage 5; Critical Hit 3; Range [Close]), For­ ward Mounted Concussion Missile Launcher (Fire Arc Forward; Damage 6; Critical Hit 3; Range [Short); Breach 4, Blast 4, Guided 3, Limited Ammo 1, Slow-Firing 1). DEALING WITH THE SENTRY DROID There are a few ways to deal with the sentry droid. • Sneaking in: The droid’s scanner does not extend all the way around the asteroid and surrounding space. If the PCs wait for the droid to journey to the far side of the asteroid and then fly into the tunnels as quickly as possible, they may be able to bypass it. This maneuver will require the pilot of the ship to pass a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Piloting (Space) check. If this test is failed, the droid notices them and warns Bandin Dobah and Alger. • Destroying the Droid: If the PCs are able to de­ stroy the droid within a single round, it cannot send a warning. However, if they take more than one round to destroy it, the droid does send an alert before fighting back to the best of its ability. • Broadcasting the Password file: If the PCs found the file named “Pass” on Daro Blunt’s computer, and broadcast it to the sentry droid before it has decided that they are hostile, it stands down. The droid sends a message to Bandin Dobah alerting him to the fact that Daro Blunt has arrived. • Jam the Droid: The droid's comlink is not incred­ ibly powerful and can be jammed with an Average Computers check that takes one action. If the droid’s comlink is jammed, it cannot send out an alert, but will fight back against the intruders. Any PC with either Piloting (Space) or Computers should know this is an option automatically. DEALING WITH THE Z-TIE If the PCs broadcast the passcode file or sneak past the sentry droid, Alger remains landed, and the PCs avoid fighting the Z-TIE. However, if they attack or jam the droid, he jumps in his snubfighter and attacks them. The pressure-shed is at the "top” of the aster­ oid, so he can get to the sentry droid’s location in one full turn no matter where the droid is. If the PCs take the sentry droid by surprise, either by sneaking up to it and attacking it or broadcasting the passcode and then attacking it, the smuggler takes an additional turn to get into his cockpit and get his fight­ er moving. In any case, at the end of either one or two of his turns (after moving flat out), he ends up within medium range of the PCs. Alger is filled with perhaps more confidence than he should be, and expects that he and his droid ally can take down the PCs. If possible, he closes to short range and fires his concussion mis­ sile, then closes to finish the job with lasers. If, however, the PCs sneak past the smuggler and droid entirely, they must contend with him when they leave the asteroid. Presuming they’ve dealt with Dobah, they are in a slightly different bargaining position. Alger’s snub- fighter has no hyperdrive. Rather than be stranded in space, he’ll try to bargain with the PCs to hitch a ride elsewhere, offering the 500 credits he has on hand. If they spurn him, he attacks out of anger and desperation. INSIDE THE ASTEROID The tunnels have been created by gigantic space slugs, and while they have been abandoned for many years, the smooth cavern walls are still covered in a slick of stringy ichor and lumps of black excreta. At junctions in the tunnel network, the goo coalesces into dangling sticky stalagmites, and a pilot making his way through the tunnels should make a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Piloting (Space) check to avoid daubing the gunk over his ves­ sel. The stuff is mildly corrosive and if it isn’t removed within a few days it causes two points of hull trauma. POINT A-G O DO N NETAKKA S SHIP In this cavern is a small one-person spacecraft. The vessel has been abandoned and is in poor shape. While exploring the asteroid, Codon flew it into some of the corrosive gunk that coats the tunnels and large patches of the chassis have been stripped to pitted and blackened metal. If the PCs take the trouble to break into the vessel, they find that most of the useful and portable items have been removed. If the PCs explore the vessel’s small hold, they find five helium grenades (these weapons have no stats, but can be used to expose mynocks to helium) in a plastic box, a pair of glow rods, and a rack of six Thalassian Security binders. POINT B—MYNOCK CAVERN This large cavern is home to a small flock of mynocks who nestle in rocky crevices in the roof. Unless suitable precautions are taken, a few of the mynocks detect the presence of any ship entering their vicinity. If the PCs fly a ship into the cavern, five mynocks attack. They seek to latch onto the ship in order to feed from its power cables. The mynocks start their descent at long range from the vessel and, unless destroyed in flight, they latch on and prove virtually impossible to remove from the inside. The mynocks act as a single group, and once attached must be cleared off with blasters or helium grenades. For more information on mynocks, see page 41 5. POINT C-BA ND IN DOBAH S VESSEL Bandin Dobah’s ship is a YV-666 Medium Freighter, the Vagrant. For the time being, it is also his hideout. The ship has landed in one of the caves, and Bandin has set up a small pressure curtain on the cave's en­ trance, so he can leave it and enter it easily. Unfortu­ nately for him, his laziness means his ship is some­ what exposed. Power cables run out of the cargo bay to the cavern’s pressure curtain generator and a set of arc-lights, meaning he can't secure the ship without severing them (and possibly damaging the ship). There is enough cabin space to comfortably house four crew (another crew sleeps in the common room and Godon Netakka stays in one of the escape pods). The Vagrant has one other problem. Currently its main hyperdrive is broken, leaving it with its backup hy­ perdrive and sublight drives only Bandin has been lax about getting it repaired, since most of his agents come to him. This laziness could prove to be a problem now. OUTSIDE THE SHIP The cavern the ship rests in is a flat expanse of exposed rock. The pressure curtain generator is tucked into one side of the cavern, and there is an arc light array on ei­ ther side. Some of the crew have set up simple chairs and tables “outdoors" as well, although none are there currently. A pair of binary load lifter droids stomp back and forth, picking up some simple cargo and supplies, and shuffling it around. They ignore the PCs completely. There are also three cargo pods, each with two con­ tainers of glitterstim. Each container is rigged for smug­ gling; they look like innocuous foodstuff containers and are rigged to destroy the contents if opened incorrectly. The job, however, was sloppy. Anyone who inspects one of the pods should make an Easy (^ ) Perception check If he succeeds, he notices the pod is rigged. Dis­ arming the device takes an Average Mechanics check, with failure meaning the contents ignite. COCKPIT The cockpit of the vessel includes seating for the pilot and co-pilot. The ventral-mounted twin laser cannon can be operated from the co-pilot’s position. GALLEY A ND REFRESHER Basic but functional kitchen facilities are positioned to one side, with a rather unhygienic-looking shower and lavatory to the other. A vending machine in the galley produces fairly decent cups of hot caf. CABINS The five cabins are small and spare, consisting of a bunk, chest, and dresser. The pirates mostly trust Ban- din Dobah with things like money and equipment, so the only items to be found in these rooms are personal things such as spare clothes and mementos of home. The first mate’s cabin is occupied by one of the Aqual- ish crew members, who became first mate by dint of his long service rather than any real skill. Dobah takes the captain’s cabin. The cabin’s desk has 530 credits inside. COMMON ROOM The common room contains a long table on which meals are served and conferences held. There is also a rather nice dejarik table in one corner, though if it is turned on, the projected image is so blurred and flickering as to be virtually unplayable. BOARDING RAMPS A ND MACHINE SHOP This area of the craft serves as the armory. Unless picked up by the crew, there are three blaster carbines here, as well as spare parts and power sources for the weapons. A pair of shock gloves and a hefty iron blud­ geon (count as a Gaffi Stick) are also stored here. CARGO BAY, ELEVATOR, A ND LOADING RAMPS The cargo bay is piled high with boxes and crates and strewn with all manner of detritus. Most of these are empty or filled with plastic packing and shredded pa­ per. An elevator provides access to shelves near the roof of the bay, though the boxes stored here are all empty. A PC who announces that he is giving the bay a thorough search can make a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Percep­ tion check. If he succeeds, he finds a hidden compart­ meant on the floor. This compartment contains a con­ tainer of glitterstim (100 doses, worth 5,000 credits on the black market). To either side of the bay are loading ramps through which the crew can move cargo. ESCAPE PODS The escape pods provide enough room for four peo­ ple to sit in relative comfort. Codon Netakka uses the starboard escape pod as a makeshift cabin. ENGINEERING SECTION The tools and devices needed to service the ship’s various engines and systems are neatly stored here. A ladder from the engineering section allows a gunner access to the ship’s laser cannon turret. DEFAULT POSITIONS OF CREW Unless they have been roused, the crew is stationed as follows: the first mate is in the cockpit, Dobah is in his cabin, the three human crew are in the common room sharing caf and a conversation, and Godon Ne­ takka is in the starboard escape pod. BANDIN DOBAH AND HIS CREW Bandin Dobah is a stereotypical pirate captain: reckless, crude, and aggressive. His belligerence soon earned him the respect of several of his fellows on the Aqual- ish home world of Ando and he proved a natural gang leader. Dobah’s impressive force of will compensated for his natural lack of charm. He soon made a number of enemies for himself on Ando, and so he embarked on a career as a spacefarer, captaining a roguish crew willing to undertake all manner of mercenary activity or acts of piracy in order to keep the credits rolling in. Age has mellowed Dobah to some degree, though by any civilized measure he’s still a violent brute. He no longer has the energy to ply the hyperspace routes of the galaxy in search of easy pickings, but he has been able to turn his resources into effectively managing his network of smuggling teams around the Kessel Run. He tends to conduct his business through a series of intermediaries such as Daro Blunt. Dobah still rules through intimidation rather than true leadership qualities, and his crew obeys him more out of fear than loyalty. His bullying and boorishness offend all but the most hardened of space pirates, but while the profits from the black market glitterstim trade continue to flow, they remain loyal nevertheless. Bandin’s crew consists of three humans and another Aqualish, the rest of his henchmen serving much the same role as Daro Blunt by heading the different smug­ gling teams that form his network. They are all individ­ ually fierce though they only fight as long as they are confident of victory. Once Bandin is killed or disabled, they try to negotiate for their own lives and freedom.

Bandin’s three human crew use the Pirate Crew profile on page 393, fighting as a single group. If they manage to get to the armory before the fight begins, they use blaster carbines. Otherwise, they use their pistols. DOBAH'S RESPONSE Bandin Dobah's reaction to the arrival of the PCs de­ pends on how they dealt with the sentry droid on the way into the asteroid. FULL ALERT If the PCs allowed the sentry droid to warn Dobah, he and his people are on full alert. The first mate mans the ship’s medium laser cannon and shoots to destroy any incoming threat. Meanwhile, the three smugglers grab blaster carbines and set up defensive positions in the cargo bay (Bandin doesn’t want to cut the pow­ er cables and take off if he doesn’t have to). They take up defensive positions behind piles of crates (gaining + 1 ranged defense) and shoot to kill. UNPREPARED If the PCs managed to sneak past the sentry droid or destroyed it before it sent a warning, Dobah and his people are unprepared. They remain in their default positions until alerted to the presence of an incoming vessel, at which point they scramble to mount the sort of defense outlined above. If the PCs manage to land and board Bandin’s ship quickly (within three rounds) they are able to escape any laser fire from the ship, and the crew is unable to arm themselves with blaster carbines or assume defensive positions. Once the PCs are inside the ship, the first mate abandons the laser cannons and heads down to deal with them personally. Godon Ne- takka attempts to find Dobah, and fights alongside him. EXPECTING DARO If the PCs were prompt about broadcasting the “Pass" file, they are able to catch Dobah and his people at a real disadvantage. Not only are they allowed to dock unhindered with Dobah’s ship, but most of the crew remains at their default positions. The three humans walk to the cargo bay in order to meet Daro and ar­ range for the movement of any cargo he might be car­ rying. Once shots are fired or an alarm raised, the other members of the crew react as outlined above. GODON NETAKKA The Rodian bounty hunter Codon Netakka is only a provisional member of Dobah’s crew. By the time Co­ don had trailed the smuggling gang back to the aster­ oid, his own ship was in such a state of disrepair that he had to abandon it and throw himself on Dobah’s mercy. Fortunately for Codon, Dobah has an uncharacteris­ tic regard for Rodians, and the gall of the young bounty hunter impressed him to the degree that he decided to work his (albeit pitiful) charm in an attempt to turn him. For his part, Godon has a sense of honor and, even though he swore to bring Dobah to justice, he cannot escape the fact that he would have died were it not for the Aqualish’s display of clemency. At the present time, he has provisionally embedded himself within the gang, though he is still somewhat confused as to whether he identifies as a criminal or a bounty hunter. This offers an opportunity to the PCs should they be clever enough to take it. When hostilities between PCs and pirates break out, they could try to appeal to the Rodian. If they make no effort to communicate with Godon, he remains by Dobah’s side and does all he can to aid the pirates. If they do, he could still be convinced to resume his duty as a bounty hunter. MAKING APPEALS TO GODON NETAKKA Any PC observing the Rodian can tell with a cursory glance that he is not fully at ease among the smugglers. Codon is feeling pretty ashamed of himself for failing to bring Bandin Dobah in and even at this stage he could be convinced to do his duty and apprehend or execute the Aqualish. There are a number of ways the PCs could appeal to him. If this occurs in combat (which is likely), each of these options takes one action. If the PCs fail this check, but score at least O O O the CM can spend the O to have Codon sit the fighting out (avoid fighting the PCs, but unwilling to go so far as to fight Bandin). • Threatening Godon: This is the least effective option, but any PC who threatens Godon should make a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Coercion check If suc­ cessful, the Rodian switches allegiance. • Shaming Godon: A more likely strategy is to try appealing to Codon’s wounded sense of identity. Any PC who mentions such things should make an Average Charm check (even if he isn’t being particularly charming about it). If the PC making such a check is a Rodian, add □ to the pool. If the PCs mention his sister, they can add an additional □ to the check. • Offering a Reward to Godon: As far as Codon is concerned, the 10,000 credit reward offered by the Empire is a good price, but not as hand­ some a reward as the money he could make by cooperating with Bandin Dobah. If the PCs men­ tion a larger figure, he may well change his mind. Codon is one greedy Rodian, but it takes a figure of 1 2,000 credits or more to shift him. If this is offered and the PCs can plausibly pay it, Godon will be mercenary enough to fight for them. If the PCs don’t have this sort of cash, Codon could be fooled by a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Deception check Should the PCs make no effort to recruit Codon, he fights alongside Dobah. Fie is too desperate to surrender, and fights to the death. GODON NETAKKA—RODIAN BOUNTY HUNTER [RIVAL] Skills: Athletics 1, Brawl 1, Perception 1, Piloting (Space) 1, Ranged (Light) 2, Streetwise 1, Vigilance 1. Talents: None. Abilities: None. Equipment: Disruptor pistol (Ranged [Light]; Damage 10; Critical 2; Range [Short], Vicious 4), reinforced gauntlets (Brawl; Damage 3; Critical 4; Range [En­ gaged]; Disorient 1), battered bounty hunter armor (+ 1 soak, + 1 defense). COLLECTING THE REWARD If the PCs manage to kill or subdue Bandin Dobah, they probably want to receive one of the generous bounties that have been placed on his head. This ei­ ther involves a journey to Sleheyron in Hutt Space to talk to Thakba Besadii Diori, or to the prison world of Kessel to deal with the office of Moruth Doole. In either case, the PCs should gain 20 XP for each ses­ sion spent on this adventure, plus 5 XP for finding the glitterstim or capturing Dobah. VISITING SLEHEYRON The planet of Sleheyron can be easily accessed from Formos via the Pabol Sleheyron hyperlane. The plan­ et is a heavily industrialized world, with many space­ ports serving its numerous urban areas and refinery districts. Few areas of the planet are free from ur­ ban sprawl, and those wildernesses that remain un­ touched are simply not habitable, riven by volcanic upheaval and lined with jagged spires of basalt slag. Thakba Besadii Diori is one of the many Hutt king­ pins who make their home on the planet, and is far from the most important. He is well known and the PCs have no problems finding directions to his palatial mansion, which lies a short distance from the planet’s largest spaceport. On seeking an audience with the Hutt, the PCs are received by his porcine Camorrean guards and served a selection of fine drinks and treats by his demonic-looking Devorian major-domo. After a short while, they are invited to discuss matters with Thakba, a particularly bulbous and slimy green Hutt. He speaks in a rumbling and gargling Huttese which is ably translated by his personal 3PO protocol droid. The reason Thakba levied the bounty on the head of Bandin Dobah is as a public relations exercise; he deals in spice and thus wants to retain his good stand­ ing with the smuggling community around the Kessel Run. As such he does all he can to accommodate the PCs and is happy to buy any glitterstim they have re­ covered with no questions asked. He offers half the going rate, but a successful Average Negotia­ tion check increases the price offered by 100 credits per container of glitterstim per & and by 100 credits for the entire deal per O If the PCs deliver Bandin Dobah's corpse, Thakba is somewhat crestfallen, but offers a compensatory 3,000 credits to the PCs for their trouble. They can take or leave this; he simply does not negotiate a larger fee. If the PCs bring Bandin Dobah to Thakba alive, they are showered in good-humored superlatives (along with some spittle) from the happy Hutt, who pays them their 5,000 credits up front. Furthermore, they are invited to watch the Aqualish's forthcoming debut performance as a gladiatorial contestant in a nearby arena. Thakba al­ lows them to watch the action from his own personal skiff, and a number of other guests enthusiastically bid handfuls of credit chips on the outcome of the fights. After a few minutes of cut and thrust, Bandin Dobah wins his first bout against a slender light blue Twi’lek. However, his luck does not hold. He is cut down within the first few moments of his second bout against a lumbering and overweight Weequay. VISITING KESSEL The prison planet of Kessel appears from space as a misshapen and uninhabitable chunk of bare rock. The surface of the world is dotted with factories that strug­ gle to provide its thin but breathable atmosphere. The world is heavily guarded by orbiting satellites and squadrons of TIE fighters. The PCs are contacted by Imperial ships long before they reach the planet, and are grilled as to their reasons for visiting Kessel. Once the PCs have satisfied their interrogators as to their identity and the reason for their visit, they are es­ corted to the surface of the world and instructed to land near a utilitarian administration building. Stormtroopers meet the PCs on the landing pad, search them for weap­ owns, and escort them to the office of Moruth Doole. Doole, the deeply corrupt Rybet administrator of the mining operation on Kessel, is not willing to see the PCs personally, leaving the matter of verify­ ing their claims to a couple of subordinate officials dressed in gray military uniforms. If Bandin Dobah is alive, they quickly confirm his identity. However, if they are given a corpse, they dispute it is the Aqualish they were looking for. They refuse to pay a reward un­ less one of the PCs gives a very good account of their efforts to track down and kill the fugitive and passes a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Charm check. Even if the guards are satisfied that the PCs have brought Bandin Dobah to justice, they are not forthcom­ ing with the reward. A veritable army of underlings and servants are dispatched to various parts of the build- ing with a promise of getting them their money. In the end, only 2,300 credits can be found. One of the of­ ficials makes half-hearted excuses. The PCs are offered the money as well as a small and heavy metal cylinder that the officials insist contains an encrypted computer code to the effect that the PCs are owed 7,700 credits. This is completely true, though an in-built beacon allows the Empire to monitor the position of the cylinder and therefore the movements of dubious bands of adventur­ ers like the PCs. There is no need for them to know this (and it requires some determined efforts and a Daunt­ ing ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Computers check to discover). Whenever the PCs return to Kessel in the future, they find that the office of Moruth Doole remains chronically strapped for cash. Every few months they are able to wring another thousand credits from the officials, but it will be at least a full Coruscant year before they finally get their 10,000. Furthermore, while the PCs were in the building, a squad of stormtroopers took the liberty of searching their ship, and they were able to find any glitterstim bales inside unless the PCs were careful to conceal them. In this event, the officials argue—correctly enough—that this contraband is the lawful property of the Kessel spice mining operation. They “generously” offer the PCs the opportunity to buy the bales back if they so desire. They offer to knock 4,000 credits off the total reward money they owe the PCs for each bale so bought.
