# SWRPG Session 10

2024-05-23

Spent some XP, spent some credits, got me a [new coat](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Smuggler%27s_Trenchcoat)

Donked Debo up trying to fix up, covered in tape

Cr03 (Crow) is the astromech

Was shot by Ion blaster, captured by old ship owner guy

Crow fixed Deebo up though. Droids in equal numbers to organics on the ship now. 

All the droids had an oil bath

Landed on columex in one piece, don't appear to have raised any suspicions
