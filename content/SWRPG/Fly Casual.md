He smiled indulgently and looked back to his cards. Across the cantina’s scuffed game table, Bulsar wore his usual sabacc face. It always appeared cocky to me, but humans don’t hide emotions well. Not that Bulsar liked to hide, as his garish shirt attested. “Where’s that blasted droid?” someone muttered. Captain M alrik’s men, three burly humans who smelled worse than tauntauns, grew impatient. Their glasses had been standing empty for almost a full sabacc round. “Co get the drinks yourself,” Malrik told the crewman sternly. “You’re out anyway.” His glass was empty too. I put my green hand on Malrik’s brown one and gave it a squeeze while I watched his man rise out of the corner of my eye. My companion’s crew was a crude lot, and I worried he might make trouble at the counter. “ Ha!” Bulsar slapped his cards onto the table where the interference field would keep them from shifting. An idio t’s array. How appropriate. “ He’s cheating,” M alrik growled. “Search him!” Bulsar threw up his hands, his eyes on me. Like I was going to save him. He would blow our operation if he didn’t lose a round or two. The crew members grabbed an arm each and hauled him upright. As they searched, I turned to check on the crewman at the bar. He argued with a Gran. Blast Bulsar for distracting me. “ Excuse me,” I said, brushing my hand across M al­ rik’s shoulders as I rose. “ I’ll be right back.” I was too late. He shouted about credits owed, boasting about the cargo. Soon all the low-life scum in this place would want a piece of it, or sell M alrik out to the H utt he stole it from. I wasn’t going to wait to see which happened first; I’d get to the ship. “Going somewhere?” M alrik asked warily “Of course not,” I said, irked that he had followed me. Didn’t he trust me? Weren’t the pheromones working? I glanced meaningfully at the arguing crewman. A crowd tightened around him, and a couple of humans glanced our way. If any of them figured out that M al­ rik’s cargo was the same spice an angry, vengeful Hutt had recently “lost,” we were all in trouble. “I need to get to the ship,” Malrik said. “You coming?” I nodded. He turned to motion his men to follow us just as a Wookiee grabbed the loud-mouthed crewman at the counter with a roar. Someone fired a blaster and hit the Gran, who crashed into a table, drawing more drinkers into the fray. The droid behind the counter ducked down as more weapons appeared and chaos erupted. We ran for the exit. I swiped someone’s pistol as I pushed past, just in case. A shout thundered behind us, and M alrik grabbed my hand to hurry me along the corridor. Blasts followed us as we rounded the corner. I tried to turn to face the pursuers, but M alrik pulled me on into the docking bay. The hangar looked empty, and I relaxed a fraction as M alrik’s thugs locked the door. Then I saw the familiar shape of a Quarren in an overcoat coming down the boarding ramp. He clutched a blaster in each hand. “Who do you think you are?” Malrik snapped, point­ ing his pistol at the intruder’s tentacled head. The Quarren was quick. He raised his blasters and fired, and I turned to see the crew behind us fall before Mal­ rik took his shot. The Quarren dropped on his knees as if to give Malrik another shot. Such bravado. I slipped a hand into the shock glove in my pocket and slapped it onto the back of M alrik’s head, forc­ ing him down to the floor as he writhed in my grip. “ Let him live, Netek,” I said. “ Let him take some of the heat. You got the spice?” “ Not as much as you said. He sold some already?” “ I never saw it. Guess he exaggerated." A hiss came from the hangar door behind me; someone persistent on the other side pried it open with furry paws. I drew my pilfered pistol, and Netek raised his blasters. “ How many?” he asked. “ No idea.” “Well, put that thing away. I’ve got it.” I rolled my eyes, but he was intent on the door— it burst wide and released a Wookiee and two hairy humans into the hangar. None of them had the chance to fire a shot before Netek gunned them down. “Come on,” I said. “We’d better get rid of the stuff as soon as we can.” We turned our backs on the bulk of the transport ship and headed to the next docking bay where our own familiar freighter waited, sidestepping the fallen bodies on the way. Netek looked grumpy; not enough of a challenge for him. Some people are hard to please. Bulsar sat in the hold counting credit chips on top of a crate. He didn’t look up. “Thought I’d take the lot," he grumbled. “ I’d have won it all anyway.” “You were supposed to keep them playing,” I said. “What happened to the plan?” “And was the fight part of the plan, too? You were supposed to keep them happy.” The jo b ’s not over yet,” Netek said. “ Let’s go.” SMUGGLING AT THE EDGE S muggling in the Star Wars galaxy is a high stakes job filled with danger and excitement. However, fly­ ing from one planet to another, sneaking past Imperial patrols, and dealing with the scum of the galaxy is not just a job; it is a way of life. F ly C a s u a l provides new options for CMs and play­ ers of E dge o f the E m p ir e to create exciting and varied Smuggler characters and adventures. Chapter I: Free Traders introduces three new playable species and specializations that players may choose from to create interesting and unique charac­ ters such as alluring Falleen Charmers, shrewd Cotal Gamblers, or rugged Quarren Gunslingers. Addition­ ally, this section provides new signature abilities, Motivations, Obligations, and more. Chapter II: Tricks of the Trade offers several new ways for Smugglers to make their way in the universe. Smugglers can wield new weapons, equipment, and item modifications presented here to escape from sticky situations. They can also use new vehicles and vehicle customizations to earn bigger paydays, make daring escapes, and outsmart cunning adversaries. Chapter III: It’s Just Business provides GMs with the tools they need to incorporate Smugglers into any group or craft adventures that put Smugglers in the spot­ light F ly C a su a l also provides additional rules for quick- draw duels, gambling, and hyperspace travel, as well as adventure hooks for running Smuggler campaigns involving underworld contracts with organizations like the Crymorah, Black Sun, or the Zann Consortium. There is more to the life of a Smuggler than just sneaking contraband across the galaxy. Sometimes it takes flattery and rakish good looks to get the job done. Smugglers may need to test their luck at the sabacc table rather than behind the stick of a tramp freighter. A Smuggler occasionally needs to stare his enemy down through the sights of his blaster when a deal goes bad. These are just some examples of what it means to live the life of a Smuggler. SMUGGLING IN STAR WARS S mugglers ferry commodities designated as contra­ band by the Galactic Empire and planetary govern­ ments to every conceivable destination in the galaxy, from the Core Worlds to the lawless Outer Rim Territo­ ries. Even Imperial strongholds like Coruscant, Bren- taal IV, and Kuat have thriving underworlds supplied by Smugglers. Jobs moving contraband are never in short supply, and with the right contacts, a Smuggler can find work in almost any spaceport. Suppliers and clientele from the spice trade, galactic mega-corpo­ rations, the Rebel Alliance, the Galactic Empire, and even honest folks desperate for supplies can make talented Smugglers wealthy. To minimize exposure to Imperial patrols and local defense forces that monitor major hyperlanes, Smugglers are always on the lookout for faster, less- used hyperspace routes. Smugglers plot dangerous courses along uncharted paths to avoid detection and to shave precious time from their journeys to beat the competition. Some Smugglers and syndicates even bribe Hyperspace Navigator’s Guild scouts to delay adding newly discovered routes to the Bureau of Ships and Services’ star charts, allowing those Smug­ glers temporary exclusive access to those routes. Smuggling often follows exploration and coloniza­ tion efforts around the galaxy. Clever Smugglers take advantage of new transit routes found by hyperspace explorers to make faster runs off the beaten path. Some Smugglers sell astronavigational data on old Smugglers’ routes back to those same exploration companies for quick credits, much to the chagrin of other Smugglers still using the once-secret hyper­ lanes. After settlers establish colonies in a new area, opportunistic Smugglers swoop in to capitalize on those new markets, ferrying contraband to colonists or securing exclusive contracts to smuggle stolen goods offworld for unscrupulous settlers looking to make credits on the side. Many Smugglers lack the resources to operate independently this way for long, and sometimes orga­ nize to form smuggling rings that focus on a particu­ lar area of space. Each member of these operations performs a designated task in exchange for a share in the profits. However, both honor and trust are in short supply among underworld denizens, and these endeavors rarely last. Rather than face the near­ impossible task of striking out on their own or risk double-crossing business partners, most Smugglers turn to criminal organizations for steady smuggling work. Unfortunately, working for syndicates like the Crymorah, Black Sun, or a Hutt kajidic comes with its own problems, and many Smugglers do not realize the dangers of working with these groups until they find themselves on the run from their former patrons. A B R IE F H IS T O R Y OF S M U G G L IN G As long as there have been laws prohibiting cer­ tain goods, there have been those who circumvent those laws to capitalize on demand. In a sprawling, galactic civilization, Smugglers slip past checkpoints, blockades, and customs inspections to ensure the delivery of contraband anywhere in the galaxy. The art of smuggling has grown with civilization, and one world’s salt is another world’s glitterstim—even water is restricted from importation on some plan­ ets. Weapons, medical supplies, livestock and game, and industrial equipment face potential regulation or restrictions on certain worlds, necessitating a skilled Smuggler to provide the supply. Despite the wide variety of contraband, there has been no greater boon with a lasting impact to the smuggling industry as the spice trade. “Spice” is the name for multiple psychoactive chemicals with a wide range of effects. The galaxy’s obsession with spice began long before the dawn of the Republic. For millennia, people used spice in the form of food seasoning, smoking tabac, medicine, and mild recre­ ational drugs. Spice functioned as a preservative for supplies aboard the generation ships responsible for pre-hyperdrive era colonies such as Alderaan and Kuat. It was not until the discovery of carbonite ore and andris spice on the Deep Core world of Koros that spice became integral to galactic travel and trade. Sus­ pending the passengers in hibernation allowed colony ships to travel the long journeys to new planets using experimental dimensional drives, but the stasis was dangerous and often fatal. The use of andris spice as a therapeutic drug alleviated many symptoms of hiber­ nation sickness and significantly reduced the risks associated with suspended animation, which ushered in a new wave of exploration and colonization. As dimensional drives, hyperspace cannons, and other technologies advanced, sentient beings colo­ nized more planets, and settlers created or discov­ ered more potent spice varieties. Unfortunately, most types of spice are highly addictive, and their use as narcotics skyrocketed alongside their utilitarian func­ tion in exploration. The Republic began regulating or outlawing the production of most forms of spice; in response, a lucrative invisible market sprang up to feed the galaxy’s growing addiction. The invention of the modern hyperdrive ended andris spice’s official use in the exploration field. How- ever, its refined use as a stimulant became popular in the spice trade. Criminal organizations and seedy corporations alike hire Smugglers to traffic the prohib­ ited hallucinogenic substance to every corner of the Republic. To this day, narcotic spice remains the most smuggled contraband in the galaxy by far. Criminal organizations like Black Sun, the FHutt cartels, Car’das, and the Zann Consortium employ Smugglers by the thousands to move untold amounts of spice and other contraband everywhere from the scorching sand dunes of Tatooine to the glimmering spires of Coruscant. S M U G G L IN G A N D TH E O U T ER R IM The life of a Smuggler is dangerous and difficult, wrought with far more ways to die than to prosper. Smugglers risk life and limb, dodging law enforcement, chancing the ire of cutthroat crime lords, and gam­ bling with their ships by traveling treacherous hyper­ space routes just to shave precious minutes off their delivery runs. This dangerous regimen holds many of the same risks involved with the frontier lifestyle of Outer Rim culture. Survival is a difficult enough task for those who live on the edge of civilization, which offers endless gruesome ways to die. Fortunately, for both Smugglers and inhabitants of the Outer Rim, the two groups can help each other eke out an existence. Some Smugglers maintain exclusive contracts with distant outposts, arriving with contraband and leav­ ing with local goods to sell elsewhere. Smugglers work with small planetary crime rings and smuggle goods stolen from far-flung mining outposts. Some Smug­ glers even work with corporate employees who skim product from refineries and production facilities to sell on the open market in exchange for a percent­ age of the sale price, making it in the Smuggler’s best interest to find the market offering the highest price. CRIMINAL SYNDICATES Eventually, most Smugglers end up working for one of the galaxy’s numerous criminal organizations. Most crime syndicates possess the resources required to operate large-scale smuggling rings success­ fully without the petty squabbling that plagues the smaller groups or the tedious overhead of operating independently. Smugglers who make deals to work exclusively for a particular syndicate receive steady work and a percentage of profits to do what they do best—make the runs on time without getting caught. As long as a Smuggler can make good on his end, the money is great, at least at first. In the criminal under­ world, deals have a habit of worsening over time. Working for the criminal underworld is not with­ out its pitfalls, even for those who fulfill their duties according to their contracts. To continue receiving supply run jobs without losing them to eager competi­ tors, Smugglers must push their limits. Suppliers and crime lords threaten mediocre Smugglers to excel. Over time, even the best Smugglers in the business can find themselves double-crossed. It is not uncom­ mon for a syndicate to hire pirates to hijack its own smuggling ships and steal its cargo mid-transit, only to blame the Smuggler for the lost merchandise and saddle the unsuspecting freighter captain with the cost of the shipment. Crime bosses use these underhanded tactics to force Smugglers into servitude. After all, why pay for a service when they can get it free? This advantage also forces Smugglers with a propensity for morality into hauling questionable cargo. While Smugglers working for crime syndicates move all manner of contraband, the criminal underworld often deals in hallucinogenic varieties of spice, exotic and endangered animals, arming both sides of a conflict, and the trafficking of slaves. Those who refuse to work, divulge syndicate information to other organizations, fail to repay their debts, or attempt to work for rival crime lords while under contract often find themselves blacklisted from future work, or worse, with prices on their heads. As the Galactic Empire tightens its grip on the galaxy and outlaws more goods and liberties, smuggling active­ ity increases. While the Empire, Sector Rangers, and planetary defense forces combat smuggling fiercely, the underworld’s reach stretches to nearly every cor­ ner of the galaxy. Even galactic mega-corporations uti­ lize Smugglers to sidestep stifling regulations, tariffs, and product bans imposed by the Empire. HIDEOUTS While many Smugglers establish hideouts on the infamous Smugglers’ Moon of Nar Shaddaa or the asteroid held at the edge of the galaxy known as Smuggler’s Run, some desire even more remote sanc­ tuaries. Other Smugglers try to strike out on their own and establish bases of operation outside the turf of their would-be competitors. The Outer Rim Territories are vast and brimming with unexplored pockets of space where Smugglers can set up shop. Smugglers frequently discover uncharted worlds that they later use as a base or hideout. Failed colo­ nies, abandoned mining facilities, and even remote areas of deep space make ideal locations for Smug­ glers to patch their hulls and plan their next job. Smaller smuggling crews do not always have the luxury of setting up bolt-holes for when the Empire, bounty hunters, or angry crime bosses come calling. For those who lack the resources to establish private outposts, they can seek asylum on friendly, out-of- the-way settlements in exchange for credits, contra­ band, or much-needed supplies. These unassuming colonies also make great places to refuel and restock when Smugglers are too far out to make it back to the nearest starport. CORPORATE JOBS Corporate personnel occasionally contact Smugglers with their corporation’s knowledge. Pharmaceutical companies endure stiff regulations on spice procure­ meant or must relinquish a percentage of their product to the Imperial Military. Therefore, these companies hire Smugglers to deliver spice shipments to clandestine Outer Rim facilities where they manufacture products without adhering to the Empire’s stifling restrictions. The lofty prohibitions placed on certain technolo­ gies by the Empire have made it impossible for some civilizations to survive. For example, the galaxy-wide ban on cloning technology following the declaration of the New Order had a detrimental impact on worlds such as Columus and Khomm, whose people use cloning to perpetuate their respective species. Rather than face extinction, these populations rely on Smug­ glers to supply them with the raw materials they need to produce the outlawed hardware that lets their spe­ cies persist to the next generation. HONEST WORK AND RELIEF EFFORTS Not all smuggled goods are illegal. Life is hard on the galactic fringe, and much needed materials are rarely on hand, or planetary taxation makes them unaffordable. Sometimes settled systems lie so far off the shipping lanes that most companies tack on exorbitant freight charges or refuse to bother mak­ ing supply runs altogether. This allows Smugglers to provide a beneficial service to colonists, prospec­ tors, and other frontier folk by sneaking past plan­ etary blockades, customs inspectors, and govern­ meant officials to provide goods directly to the ones that need them most. Unfortunately, providing this service can sometimes put Smugglers and the ones they supply at odds with local crime rings benefit- ting from the shortages. Thugs and criminals sometimes steal goods from supply ships and colonial storehouses, reselling the pilfered goods back at a premium. When Smugglers cut into their profits by delivering more supplies, these criminals often take their frustrations out on the local population. During their deliveries, settlers sometimes hire Smugglers to protect homesteads and towns from swoop gangs, crime rings, and other brigands. Smugglers never know when they have to put their blaster skills to the test and face off against other gunslingers to keep their clients alive. S M U G G L IN G A N D T H E GALACTIC CORE Some of the best Smugglers in the galaxy originate from Coreward regions. Corellians share their home- world with galactic shipbuilder Corellian Engineering Corporation, leading hyperdrive fuel producer Black Hole Hypermatter, and countless durasteel refiner­ ies, lending to their rich spacefaring heritage and rep­ utation for having thruster fuel in their veins. Duros are gaunt blue- to green-skinned humanoids. They possess an innate wanderlust and knack for engineer­ ing that helped them explore the stars and establish colonies and trade outposts even before hyperdrives. Corellians and Duros have been smuggling since the days of hyperspace cannons over a thousand genera­ tions ago, and as designers of the modern hyperdrive, these two cultures have long traditions as top-class spacers who push limits and flout authority. While shadowports—secret spaceports unknown to the authorities—exist across the Core, their berths are limited. Also, shadowports may only allow ships contracted with certain smuggling rings. So operat­ ing as a Smuggler in the Core Worlds often requires additional tradecraft beyond the typical Outer Rim spice-runner’s repertoire. While smuggling in Rimward regions takes unflinching nerves and steady hands at the yoke, working in Coreward regions also requires silk-smooth demeanor and intimate knowledge of trade law. Thousands of star systems densely packed into well-explored sectors afford little opportunity to discover (let alone use) secret hyperspace routes, forc­ ing Smugglers to blend with regular traffic along con­ gested hyperlanes teeming with military checkpoints. The Bureau of Ships and Services and Imperial Cus­ toms maintain facilities in almost every starport in the Core. Few port authorities succumb to bribery, so the cost of doing business in the Core means Smug­ glers must uphold squeaky-clean appearances—per­ mits and licenses must be up-to-date, and illegal cargo and weapon load-outs must be well-hidden. If a Smuggler is wanted, convincing forged documents with matching transponder codes are essential. Dur­ ing the inevitable inspection, a Smuggler must con­ vince authorities he is just another traveler to avoid hard labor in the spice mines of Kessel—or worse, having his ship impounded! SMUGGLING AND THE REBEL ALLIANCE In their fight against the Galactic Empire, the Rebel Alliance cannot afford to set up traditional logis­ tics networks like its enemy. The Rebels stay con­ stantly on the move, searching for allies and sup­ plies. Alliance Intelligence scours the galaxy in search of talented individuals, coaxing them to join their cause. For the right price, the Alliance also recruits Smugglers with a reputation for discretion to aid them in im portant covert tasks. Smugglers with a more defined sense of morality or outright hatred for the Empire volunteer to work, sometimes exclusively, for Alliance High Command. The Alliance uses Smugglers as links in the sup­ ply chain for various secret Rebel bases hidden in all corners of the galaxy. Using their intimate knowledge of hyperlanes, Imperial patrol patterns, and criminal territorial boundaries, Smugglers slip in and out of supply depots and spaceports undetected to provide the Alliance with arms, equipment, and medical sup­ plies that might attract attention if moved through legitimate means. Posing as simple freighter cap­ tains, Smugglers move intelligence to Alliance drop­ off points in a way that evades the Empire’s constant monitoring and avoids risking the questionable secu­ rity of shadowfeeds. Smugglers comprise an invaluable relief aid resource to the Rebellion. In addition to performing emergency drops of medical supplies and rations to civilian populations of war-torn areas on behalf of the Alliance, Smugglers also use their transports to evacu­ ate civilians from active combat zones. The Alliance taps Smugglers to punch into war zones to provide supplies and ammunition to Rebel armies trapped beneath Imperial blockades. Alliance High Command calls on Smugglers to extract high-value assets from Imperial worlds, and it sometimes personally utilizes Smugglers to spirit away officers and the occasional princess when the Empire gets too close. Rebel operatives use Smugglers for more than just transporting cargo; sometimes what a Smug­ gler knows is more beneficial than what they can do. The Alliance often pays underworld captains, cartographers, and navigators for up-to-date astro- navigational data on secret Smugglers’ routes. With their contacts in various navigation guilds, Smugglers often act as go-betweens on behalf of the Alliance, securing hyperspace routes unknown to the Impe­ rial Military. For example, after joining the Rebel­ lion, Chewbacca secured the entire Claatuvac Guild astrogation database for the Alliance. Rebel explor­ ers work with their networks of spies and Smugglers to obtain coordinates to uncharted worlds, where the Rebellion could establish military outposts in out-of-the-way locations. SMUGGLING AND THE GALACTIC EMPIRE The Empire’s hand is oppressive, and its reach is immense. Smugglers must have nerves of durasteel and wits as sharp as vibroblades to stay off the Empire’s most wanted list. To accomplish this goal, Smugglers spend a considerable amount of time on the run from Imperial patrols, sneaking through block­ ades, and bribing customs officials. The list of pos­ sible infractions under Imperial law is long, but none as treasonous as speaking out against the Emperor. Smugglers frequently traffic goods for private col­ lectors and dealers such as holodramas, literature, music, and artwork that harbor anti-imperial senti­ meant. Creators of such material and activists speaking out against the Empire sometimes contact Smugglers, desperate to escape Imperial territory to avoid retri­ bution for their work. To mask their presence, Smug­ glers accept legitimate jobs performing deliveries or charters before meeting their contact to smuggle him or her offworld. Not all Smugglers see the actions of the Rebellion as a benefit to the greater good. Some think working for the Rebellion draws too much unwanted atten­ tion, while still others cut deals with the Empire in exchange for immunity for past crimes. To accomplish this, Smugglers agree to work for the Empire as dou­ ble agents who spy on the Alliance. These Smugglers work shadowports, looking for Alliance contracts to gain the Rebels’ trust, then divulge any useful info­ mation to their Imperial handlers. Not all Smugglers working for the Empire are willing participants, how­ ever, as the Empire brainwashes some Smugglers dur­ ing incarceration or implants them with secret, long- range tracking devices before their release. Less scrupulous Smugglers look out for themselves above all else, even turning against the crime syndi­ cates that provide them with steady work. Greedy Smugglers sometimes work in concert with Imperial Moffs or military commanders to root out lawbreak­ ers in hiding and crime rings system or sector wide. In exchange for a hefty sum of credits on which they can retire, these Smugglers divulge names, locations, and other useful information the local Imperial garrison uses to shut down these operations for good. If the Smuggler is shrewd, he could strike a deal to fill the void left by the ousted crime ring so long as the local Imperial governor receives a percentage of the profits. Smugglers who prove their resourcefulness to the Empire might be fortunate enough to score contracts working for Imperial Intelligence. The Empire some­ times uses Smugglers for covertly inserting elite com­ mando units into populated areas, space stations, and shadowports. Smugglers could even make sup­ ply runs to top-secret Imperial facilities or the cov­ eted Byss Run. Even though these contracts are quite lucrative, wise Smugglers always have an exit strategy. When the contract expires or the Smuggler has out­ lived his usefulness, the Empire does not provide a severance package—they just terminate the Smuggler along with his contract. FREE TRADERS “Look, I a in ’t in this for your revolution, and I’m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for the money." -Han Solo It takes a certain type of person to become a suc­ cessful Smuggler. Smuggling is a career of risks with the potential for great rewards, a life full of danger with many opportunities for adventure. For someone who can hack the lifestyle, smuggling is exciting and profitable, but it takes skill, courage, and better-than- average luck to be a Smuggler who lives to boast of it. Often scrabbling their way from the bottom of the pile up to captaining their own starship, Smugglers learn a lot along the way. They get a great view of the underworld, meet a wide range of interesting people, and develop many skills that no Imperial pilot ever learns at an academy. Most importantly, Smugglers can control their own destinies. Smugglers work throughout the galaxy, but many frequent the Outer Rim where the Empire’s influ­ ence is weakest. There’s a good reason smuggling is so prevalent—it’s a necessary evil. The Smugglers themselves may be in business for the profit, but they are providing an im portant service for many. Some worlds cannot trade for the bare necessities any other way, and in a galaxy of inequality and injustice, Smugglers allow these worlds to survive. In some parts of the galaxy under Imperial rule, Smug­ glers are such a welcome sight their customers even consider them heroes. Despite their popularity, many Smugglers fall vic­ tim to blackmail and betrayal during their careers. It’s in the nature of the job; smuggling is illegal, and clients are often less-than-respectable entrepre­ neurs. Smugglers also have to spend a lot of time fighting, evading, or fleeing from those who enforce Imperial law, even out on the fringes. Smugglers have an ability to bend the rules, and most refuse to acknowledge any clear-cut line between right and wrong. As far as laws are concerned, any Smuggler can vouch that these vary from planet to planet anyway, and even morals are very much in the eye of the beholder. Successful Smugglers are not likely to have survived without help, though, and even the most self-serving among them know how to coop­ erate—at least when it’s necessary to turn a profit. THE REAL DEAL: A SMUGGLER'S LIFE n Smuggler always keeps his ear to the ground for his next contract. He has to make a living and earn the credits to keep his ship flying. This keeps the adventure moving and can take the Smuggler great distances across the galaxy. Occasionally, a Smuggler finds a steady job traveling the same route for the same boss, but this will rarely be permanent. Even if a Smuggler joins a larger smuggling organization, his role isn’t likely to remain the same every day. Any Smuggler working for an organization like Black Sun probably joined because of his ambition, and that ambition will compel him to move up through the ranks and fulfill various duties along the way. A Smuggler must be ready to face the unexpected, since he never knows how a job might go. He needs to be able to rely on his blaster, his ship, his crewmates, and most of all, himself. He faces numerous dangers in his line of work, and since the Smuggler plays outside the law, he must think outside the box. He needs to be ready to outrun or outgun Imperial starships, so must be able to navigate quickly and know all the shortcuts. He must anticipate betrayal, since the characters he deals with are often treacherous and corrupt, so light­ ning-quick thinking and well-honed weapon skills are necessary. A Smuggler must be ready to adapt to any situation in order to survive, which makes him an excit­ ing and challenging character to play. Smugglers come from a wide variety of back­ grounds, and no two smuggling careers are the same. A Smuggler can often choose which clients to work with, what types of cargo to transport, which planets or spaceports to make for, and which routes to take. Different Smugglers use different tactics to fulfill their contracts, depending on the skills and resources they have, and even the type of payment they require can differ. Some never meant to become Smugglers in the first place, but found the life thrust upon them by fate. One thing is for sure, though: the life of a Smuggler is never boring. Even if a Smuggler isn’t the type to seek out excitement, it typically finds him. Smugglers are a diverse bunch, so players have a wide range of options to consider when creating a Smuggler. One major choice is starting specialization; this determines what sort of Smuggler the PC is going to be (at least, at first), as well as the skills he brings to the group. The range of specializations offered allows for a broad array of different Smuggler types. A Smuggler’s ship is both his home and his livelihood, so his relationship with it tends to be close. He knows its strengths and weaknesses, and how to push it beyond its apparent limits. This makes most Smugglers passable operators, but some define themselves as expert Pilots. As outlaws, all Smugglers must be skilled at Deception and Negotiation, but some excel at these social skills. A Scoundrel or Charmer can talk his way into, or out of, almost anywhere. Some Smugglers began life as com­ mon thieves, and most dabble in petty crime at some point in their careers. A few specialize in this aspect of the job, becoming professional Thieves. The life of a Smuggler necessitates an element of risk, but some find themselves particularly eager to test their luck, going through life as Gamblers. This can be an easy and enter­ taining way to make some credits on the side, as long as the Smuggler’s luck is reliable. A Smuggler always has to keep his blaster handy, but some draw at the first hint of trouble. A real Gunslinger usually keeps at least two blasters at the ready, just in case. There are many reasons a Smuggler could end up in a party of non-Smugglers, and he has a lot to offer such a group. He is an intuitive Pilot and knows the best trade routes. He can scare up work for the party when credits are low and stomachs are empty. He can talk to diplomats or common thieves. Plus he is good in a tough spot, blasting or charming his way out. A Smuggler’s approach may sometimes seem hazardous and his style unpredictable, but he gets the job done. Many Smugglers enjoy the lifestyle, the challenge, and relative freedom of working for themselves. In some cases, a Smuggler hopes to earn enough to retire, but generally, once a Smuggler, always a Smuggler. Most wouldn’t have it any other way. SMUGGLER BACKGROUNDS S mugglers vary a great deal, and a player has almost limitless possibilities while developing his Smug­ gler’s background. The following scenarios provide some ideas for fleshing out a Smuggler PC during char­ acter creation. They contain ideas tailored towards the original and new Smuggler Specializations. Players can use these alongside Motivations and Obligations to create fully rounded PCs. Players are not limited to these options, however, and should feel free to come up with unique ideas for customizing characters. DISADVANTAGED For most beings in the galaxy, life is a constant battle for survival. Whether on a planet under strict Impe­ rial rule or some backwater moon far from any trade route, the career of a Smuggler becomes an attrac­ tive prospect, a way of exchanging the familiar daily struggle for a life full of potential. Work as a Smuggler is not easy, but the dream of one great score to set him up forever keeps him running the hyperlanes. The Smuggler with a disadvantaged background is tough and a little rough around the edges. He may have lived in poverty, been a slave, worked for an oppressive employer, or otherwise had it hard growing up. Pilots who have had to train themselves through trial and error, on ships that barely function, can often fly anything, even vessels that have no business in the sky. Being able to keep a rust-bucket aloft has its advantages! Scoundrels who have experienced the hard life may well have encountered enough villains to consider a life of crime normal. Whether a character with this back­ ground is trying to drag himself out or claw his way to the top, his past is sure to come back to haunt him. Thieves from a poor background are unfortunately commonplace. A Thief who has had to steal due to neces­ sity from an early age will be comfortable with his moral stance and will have had time to perfect his technique. Charmers may have been born disadvantaged, with access to few resources, and so learned how to get what they want from people through manipula­ tion. The Charmer’s social savvy is his most valuable tool, as it allows him to imitate and manipulate those who might otherwise look down on him. Gamblers tend to take life, with all its ups and downs, to extremes. A Gambler could have started life as a slave but won his own freedom. He might have worked in a casino, where he picked up a few tricks before escaping his employer to begin a life of smug­ gling. Alternatively, he may have had wealth, lost it, gained it, and lost it again. In any case, a Gambler knows how important but elusive credits can be. Gunslingers that come from poverty or oppression can be particularly dangerous. A Gunslinger who has escaped a harsh existence will know how to protect himself, relying on nothing but his weapons. PRIVILEGED Whether wealth is won, earned, or inherited, some people just have a lot more credits than anyone else. However, bad luck, poor choices in trade, or an extravagant lifestyle can quickly turn a rich per­ son into a poor one. Some Smugglers have lived the good life but lost everything. Some may have even purposefully left wealth behind, tired of the strings attached or dreaming of a life of adventure and glory. The Smuggler who has known wealth, whether he frit­ tered it away or had it forcibly taken, is not likely to have lost his privileged attitude. Pilots who come from money may well treat ships as expensive toys. A Pilot might have chosen the life of a Smuggler because flying illegal routes seemed exciting. Alternatively, his wealth was somehow lost. The destruction of Alderaan left many formerly well-to-do merchant captains with nothing but their ships, and smuggling for the Rebel Alli­ ance is a small way to fight back against the evil of the Galactic Empire. Scoundrels enjoy playing others and, in some cases, this may be because the life of a noble often allows for, and even requires, such diver­ sions. The games of the power­ ful are often the deadliest. Thieves take what they want, but some seem to never have enough. Others might treat theft as a distrac­ tion, a way to amuse them­ selves and demonstrate their superior skill. Charmers often appear confident when they are not, but some really do have the confidence of the wealthy and well-edu­ cated. A Charmer may have once spent credits to get people to do what he wanted, but he’s since learned other ways of manipulating them to his ends instead. Gamblers who have never had to worry about their credits might seem reckless and even self­ destructive, but betting big can mean winning big. Sometimes a Gambler knows what he is doing when he risks everything. Any Gambler who has known wealth once and lost it cer­ tainly wants to regain it. Gunslingers from rich families may have grown up hunting exotic animals on interplanetary safaris or fighting honor- duels to uphold familial honor. Some Gun­ slingers who honed their skills for sport or as part of complex webs of noble politics are just as deadly and precise as their bat­ tle-forged counterparts. EX-MILITARY The Imperial Army, Navy, Customs, and Storm- trooper Corps tra in and employ untold millions of humans and aliens. Though many of those enlisted remain for'the entirety of their careers or lives, some individuals face expulsion for misconduct or choose to leave of their own free will. Non-humans may have received training as part of a smaller planet- based army or fleet. Pilots who have flown for the m ilitary are prob­ ably disciplined and highly skilled. Such a Pilot may have turned to a life of smuggling in order to gain the freedom to fly where he wished, or perhaps he found his superiors unjust and could not follow their orders in good conscience. Scoundrels who joined the army or navy expect­ ing excitement and adventure will have chafed under the strict rules and regulations. They might have stayed long enough to gain some weapons or flight training, however. Thieves with a m ilitary background may seem unlikely, but perhaps a Thief began his career work­ ing for the Imperial Navy or Customs. While inter­ cepting Smugglers, he found himself very interested in the value of the cargo and credits he confiscated. Charmers are most likely to have held desk jobs in the military, but might have craved careers with more action. Such a background gives a Charmer inside info and the ability to mimic or mingle wi.th m ilitary officers and similar characters. Gamblers may have only enlisted because of a bet , in the first place, since their specialization is unlikely to have suited them to a m ilitary life. Alternatively, a Gambler may have served in the m ilitary for years, where gambling was his only pleasure or escape. • Gunslingers couid easily have picked u p th e ir par­ ticular skills in the military. A betrayal might have caused an officer to lose his position, or maybe he grew weary of his position but did not know any way to live except by practicing violence. RESPECTABLE . It’s entirely possible for a merchant to spend his whole career transporting and selling legal goods while keeping on the right side of the law, but sometimes laws change and he cannot or will not change with them. Or he might lose legitimate business and need to expand his client base to stay afloat. Either way, it is easy for a respectable trader to turn to smuggling. Pilots who fly by the book may have spent their early career in a steady job. Such a Pilot might have encountered a corrupt official and, by refusing to pay a bribe, made an enemy and lost his position. Scoundrels take the profitable cargo whether it is legal or not, and they probably traded legally in the first place only because it suited them at the time. For a Scoundrel, trade is trade, and laws mean very little.. Thieves with a high sense of honor might have begun life as respectable and law-abiding citizens, only to find themselves unfairly accused of steal­ ing. Once a Thief crosses the line, he may as well embrace the life and became a professional. A respectable Thief might steal for a living while still having a stricter code than those he robs. Charmers may have erred once or twice and got­ ten away with it. It only takes one failure to end up with a criminal record, though, and then fate might compel a Charmer to turn to smuggling. Gamblers who have worked in casinos will know all the tricks. A Gambler who bends the house rules one too many times could lose his position. Perhaps he couldn’t resist playing himself, and his luck just seemed too good to be true. Gunslingers may have made a mistake, taking a job w ithout realizing who the client really was. A Gunslinger’s natural instinct is to dravy. his weapon to solve a problem, and that could land him with a criminal record whatever trade he practices. CYNICAL Some of the most prized possessions, of a Smuggler are the stories he can tell, both tales'of his exploits and rumors he has heard on his travels.. The cynical Smug­ gler has one definitive story: the moment that not only changed the course of his life but his whole view of the- galaxy. Due to a traumatic event, this Smuggler-carries a big chip on h-is shoulder. He’s lost faith in law, order, or people in general. In a galaxy of infinite possibili­ ties, this event could be anything from the destruction of his homeworld to a personal betrayal. Pilots might have lost ships or been prevented from purchasing them in the first place. Cheated of the one piece of machinery necessary to make use of his skills and earn a living, a cynical Pilot takes metic­ ulous care of any ship he has the opportunity to fly. Scoundrels usually shrug off the occasional case of deception or betrayal, but this Smuggler may have seen injustice on a larger scale. Perhaps he witnessed the Empire’s cruelty close-up, and now fights injustice and causes trouble for the Empire whenever he can. Thieves may have had .their own wealth or way of life stolen from them. A Thief who has been the mark might feel the galaxy Still owes him. Charmers are adept at manipulating people, so for, a Charmer to be deceived is particularly galling. A Charmer who has fallen victim to another, smoother' manipulator will be very careful not to trust again. Gamblers like taking risks, but this may be because they know playing it safe doesn’t always work. If he’s been cautious before and lost every­ thing anyway, then he has nothing to lose. Gunslingers are ready and willing to defend them ­ selves. A Gunslinger who has experienced a great betrayal or loss is quick to become the aggressor, and he’s likely to shoot first. BORN AND BRED Some Smugglers have never been anything else. They may come from a long line of Smugglers. They may not know where they came from, but were forced into the life of a Smuggler before they were old enough to make a decision for themselves. Either way, smuggling is all this Smuggler knows, and he does it well. Pilots know and love their ships. The Pilot who grew up op starships will be quick to learn the strengths and weaknesses of any ships he encounters. Once he gets his hands on the controls of one, he’ll bond with it quickly. Scoundrels thrive within the Smuggler’s life, and it is feasible that they have known no other life. A Scoundrel may have grown up on a lawless planet, perhaps in close proxim ity to some crime lord or a group of active Smugglers. Thieves might have spent their childhoods working as pickpockets or lookouts for larger criminal gangs. This sort finds smuggling second nature. It may be an effort for such a Thief to resist stealing things. Charmers who learned their skills from a par­ ent or mentor in the smuggling trade will have had many opportunities to practice their abilities, and practice makes perfect Gamblers may have inherited the love of games of chance. If his mentor never won his fortune, then the Gambler might become determined to beat the odds. If his predecessor was lucky in the end, then the Gambler could believe that his time will come. Gunslingers who have never had anything to rely on but a pair of blasters will be as attached to them as a Pilot to his ship. A Gunslinger who has been a Smuggler his entire life will be quick to react and hard to surprise, since he has seen it all before. SMUGGLER OBLIGATIONS S mugglers often take on many Obligations over the course of their careers. They rely on others for job opportunities, for confidentiality, and for favors and extensions when they owe credits or have mislaid cargo. They often function outside Imperial jurisdiction, as it’s part of the job, and Obligations overshadow all they do. The ability to juggle these Obligations— keeping one step ahead of the trou­ ble that Obligations cause—is an im portant ability for any successful Smuggler. His Obligations might come and go. Often, the best a Smuggler can do is pay off one debt or favor by taking on another. At least he usually pays off his debts in the end, as long as he can finish the job with his skin intact. Obligation often defines a Smuggler more than it does any other PC. Since a Smuggler’s career often requires debts, he might well have more and greater Obligations than the other characters in a party. These burdens can help flesh out his backstory and suggest the type of Smuggler he is. His is a risky career, but since he can deceive pursuers to evade capture, travel surreptitiously, and find places to hide, the Smuggler can avoid facing his Obligations until he is ready. Although he may have greater Obli­ gation than other characters, this will not necessary­ ily cause the group greater problems. Table 1 -1 : Smuggler Obligations is a modified version of Table 2 -1 : Obligations on page 39 of the E d c e o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook, adapted to include some new Smuggler-specific options. This table can replace Table 2 -1 : Obligations if the player wishes to roll randomly for a Smuggler char­ acter. Alternatively, it can provide ideas for a player who wishes to create his own Obligation, or adapt the new Obligations for other careers. As long as the CM agrees, there is no reason a character with a dif­ ferent career should not have a Bad Reputation or be High Risk if the player wants to add a Smuggler element to his PC at character creation. TABLE 1--1: SMUGGLER OBLIGATIONS d100 Obligation Type 0 1 -0 8 Antagonist: N ot all Smugglers are Charmers, and given the contacts a Smuggler makes in his line of work, it’s easy for him to insult the wrong person, group, or even species. This doesn’t always lead to Bounty, however, since not everyone can afford the credits required for an official bounty. In these cases, the Smuggler just lives with the knowledge that certain parties in the galaxy would make his life very difficult if given the chance. 0 9 - 1 6 Bad Reputation: W hether deserved or not, some Smugglers find themselves with a reputation for being untrustworthy or difficult to deal with. This can make finding jobs a struggle. Since the best way to reduce this Obligation is to successfully com plete contracts, proving himself reliable again, the Smuggler might find himself having to take the least desirable jobs for a while. Once he’s repaired his reputation, he will be able to pick and choose again. 1 7 -2 4 Betrayal: Given the nature of his job, a Smuggler might find himself a victim of betrayal or a betrayer himself If the victim, a Smuggler may seek vengeance on those who crossed him. If it was the Smuggler who let a fellow criminal down, then he must make amends somehow. In m inor cases, a simple apology may be all th a t’s needed. In extreme cases, the betrayed party might need rescuing from the spice mines of Kessel or somewhere equally unpleasant. 2 5 -3 2 Bounty: Many Smugglers earn a bounty on their heads at some point. The size of the bounty depends on the size of the Obligation, as does the nature of the bounty. A large bounty promised by a Hutt is likely to put the Smuggler in much greater peril than a sim ilar price offered for bringing him in to face charges on some backwater planet. 3 3 -4 0 Criminal: Smugglers are by nature criminal, but some manage to stay off authorities' radars be tter than others. It’s only a problem if a Smuggler gains a criminal record. This Obligation may involve avoiding a particular system where the character has a criminal record or hiding his involvement in a crime big enough to interest the authorities. In the event that the criminal record is undeserved, the Smuggler might work to expose the real perpetrator. 4 1 -4 8 Debt: Being a Smuggler offers little security, but acquiring a ship and keeping it functioning costs a lot of credits. In order to stay in business, debts may be necessary. The Smuggler has to resolve them all eventually, and some lenders are less lenient than others. If ignored, this Obligation will only get more and more pressing. 4 9 -5 6 Family: A fam ily is a particular burden for a Smuggler. Perhaps they live on a planet that rarely receives the basic necessities through legitim ate trade, and so they rely on the Smuggler to bring them im portant but inexpensive cargo. O r perhaps the Smuggler himself has brought them misfortune, and a local crime lord holds them ransom to ensure the Smuggler’s good behavior. The Smuggler could continue to follow the crime lord’s instructions or negate the Obligation by liberating his kin. 5 7 -6 4 Favor: The Smuggler owes a favor to a person or organization. Favors are a much-used currency among Smugglers, and the character may well owe favors to more than one party, perhaps even parties in com petition with each other. The nature of the favor determ lines how to resolve it, and this is up to the player and GM to decide. Depending on to whom the Smuggler owes the favor, the player may need to deal with this Obligation sooner rather than later 6 5 -7 2 N otoriety: If a Smuggler has the N otoriety Obligation, then he will be unable to travel incognito, as his face or name may be recognized This makes any jobs he takes on harder, if not impossible, to complete. This Obligation is only likely to apply in certain sectors, and the extent of its influence determ lines the size of the Obligation. The Smuggler's own behavior might have caused this, or another party may have maliciously spread information about him. If the latter, the Obligation could be reduced by tracking down the person responsible and stopping him. if the former, the Smuggler may have to avoid the affected area long enough tha t the locals forget him, or he might significantly change his appearance or name to avoid recognition. 7 3 -8 0 High Risk: The Smuggler just can’t help it; he has to take the most dangerous jobs and play for the highest stakes. He is a victim of his own pride, and his ego often lands him in trouble. This Smuggler has something to prove and, when challenged, he cannot help but take the opportunity to display his bravery, even if this puts himself and his party in harm's way. 8 1 -8 8 Servitude: Although the Smuggler might act like he’s his own boss, he is actually the property of another and must either hand over any earnings or evade his owner entirely. The Smuggler could deal with this Obligation by earning enough credits to buy his freedom, or he could kill or otherwise remove his master. 8 9 - 9 6 Under Contract: The Smuggler is under contract to obtain rare goods, transport volatile cargo, or provide difficult services. He can only put this off for so long. This Obligation is similar to Debt, but it allows the player and the GM a wider range of possibilities when determ ining the nature of the contract. 9 7 -1 0 0 Roll twice on this chart. Starting Obligation is split into two different origins. (This does not increase the O bligation’s magnitude; divide the starting Obligation into two equal parts, each with a different type.) NEW SPECIES T he three new species presented within F ly C a s u a l — the Falleen, Cotal, and Quarren—provide players and GMs alike with distinctive new options, benefits, and challenges fit for any E dge o f t h e E m p ir e cam­ paign. All three have initial characteristic ratings and special abilities that make them well-suited to becom­ ing Smugglers, but each one can work with any career. The calculating Falleen, the empathic Gotal, and the clever Quarren mix right in with the rest of the deni­ zens of the galaxy’s criminal underworld. The Falleen is an absolute master of manipulation, using powerful pheromones to cloud the minds of others and beguile the unsuspecting. This makes the Falleen a natural choice for a Charmer. The Gotal can sense the slight­ est hint of anxiety or elation with energy-sensitive horns, helping decide whether to raise or fold. And finally, the Quarren’s negotiating talents are a well­ come addition to any smuggling crew or crime ring. These species are not beholden to a life of crime, though, as their abilities make them suitable for a wide range of careers. A Falleen Trader in one of the galaxy’s countless merchant districts or onboard a trade cruiser can use his strong presence to strike a better deal for his wares. A Gotal who finds discomfort in the energy distortion of civilization might find peace on the hyperlanes or wastelands working as a Scout, Trader, or Survivalist. The Quarren have a long his­ tory of operating heavy machinery and shipbuilding alongside the Mon Calamari. A Quarren might find it second nature to work as a Mechanic or Outlaw Tech. The important thing to keep in mind is that these species open a whole new array of roleplaying chal­ lenges and opportunities for players. The familiarity of some tried and true pairings of species and career make them an easy choice, but building a Player Character presents the perfect chance to showcase an individual who breaks the mold—that’s why it’s his story being told, after all. FALLEEN Beneath the glamorous reptilian features and serene facade of the mysterious Falleen lies a shrewd mind and cold-blooded precision. A Falleen uses wiles and unique pheromones, intoxicating to most species, to achieve great things and manipulate members of other species with ease. Physiology: The Falleen are alluring reptilian human­ oids with skin of supple scales in tones ranging from deep green to a dull gray-green hue. Flowever, Fal­ leen can temporarily change their skin color at will to shades of orange or red when they exude potent pheromones to attract mates. The scales of their lithe, contoured physiques stiffen along their backs, where sharp ridges run down their spines. Female Fal­ leen exhibit muted skin tones and less-defined spinal ridges compared to males, and their ability to modify their skin pigmentation is less pronounced. The exotic features of the Falleen make them among the most universally attractive beings in the galaxy, and their grooming and the use of their pheromones only enhance this view. Flowing, silky black hair accen­ tuates their etched cheekbones and chiseled facial features. The males typically wear their hair in a single long topknot or braid, while the females favor setting their flowing locks into elaborate styles adorned with beads and decorative combs. The talons on their fin­ gers and toes remain manicured yet simple. Society: The Falleen species shares its name with its homeworld, which some say is as a tribute to its arro­ gance. Several feudal kingdoms rule over lower classes of artisans, laborers, slaves, and technicians. The ruling noble houses peacefully conduct business and politi­ cal negotiations on behalf of their world while admin­ istering domestic corporations and private interests. While minor infighting between kingdoms occurs, Fal­ leen nobles choose scheming and political maneuver­ ing as their weapons in place of outright war. Falleen value careful planning and reason, believing emotion is the natural enemy to a clear and intelligent mind. They consider displays of emotion taboo, and go to great lengths to control any outward emotional indicators. Through intense training and meditation, Falleen learn to rein in their emotions, control the color of their skin, and hone the use of pheromones to enthrall others. Falleen see species unable to con­ trol their emotions as inferior, and usually take little interest in their affairs—though many do enjoy the art of other, more expressive species. While the technology of their civilization allows them to travel to other worlds, most Falleen com­ moners never leave their planet. The lower social classes work diligently to maintain their planet’s self- sufficiency in order to keep from relying on lesser spe­ cies elsewhere in the galaxy. Instead, the Falleen opt to isolate their society from outside influences. The sale of Falleen slaves to offworlders is one of the rare exceptions to this cultural norm. As a rite of passage, young Falleen nobles embark on a pilgrimage around the known galaxy to behold its many spectacles and learn how to harness their abilities. When the pilgrims return from their journey, most use what they have learned to better govern the territories they inherit. Flowever, some pilgrims decide to remain offworld to make their mark on the galaxy. Homeworld: The planet Falleen rests in a pocket of space in the Mid Rim off the Corellian Run called the Doldur sector, and in some small way, Falleen has been a part of the greater galactic community for nearly four thousand years. The expansive rain for­ ests, sprawling plains, and snowy mountains of Falleen remain unmolested over most of the planet thanks to modest urban sectors reserved for industry. Industrial zones like the polluted Yellow District in the capital city of Throne are common within every kingdom. This efficient production allows the population of over 520 million inhabitants to remain self-sufficient. After joining the Republic, the Falleen nobility opened their world to galactic commerce and offered their manu­ facturing districts to offworld corporations. Since the Empire’s rise to power, Imperial research and development facilities monopolize Falleen’s industrial sectors. Eisen Kerioth, Moff of the Doldur sector, distrusts the Falleen due to their ability to manipulate others, and he keeps a watchful eye on the planet. To minimize Falleen influence on the rest of the galaxy, and to monitor the Empire’s interests on their world, Kerioth maintains a blockade around the planet. Throne’s stellar-class starport, once open to offworld traders importing artwork and exotic fruits, now allows only Imperial traffic and Falleen nobility on pilgrimage. As a result, multiple shadow- ports operate around the planet, exporting slaves and smuggling in offworld luxuries. Language: Almost all Falleen learn to speak Basic to interact with Imperial personnel or traders on their homeworld, to serve offworlders as slaves, or to com­ municate with other species while on their pilgrimage. Flowever, Falleen believe that, like all other things, the offworlders’ language is inferior to their own. The lack of inflection and emphasis in the Falleen language is indicative of their stoic culture and makes it easy for other species to learn. GROWING ANIMOSITY hen the Empire came to Falleen and nation­ alized many corporate manufacturing plants, the Falleen noble houses assumed it was no different from one of the countless retool­ ing phases or corporate restructurings they had seen in the past. When the noble houses stopped receiving dividends from company shares and rent for the facilities ran within their kingdoms, they grew outraged. Next, when the blockade formed over their planet to prevent all incoming and outgoing traffic, the kings said the Empire had gone too far, but they were unaware of how much worse things would become. In the wake of the burgeoning conflict, some Falleen have fled their planet, while others have turned to the Rebel Alliance for aid. SPECIES ABILITIESHowever, the use of skin coloration and phero­ mones to replace the absent modulation makes it impossible for non-Falleen, even droid translators, to master their language. The fact that only Falleen can fully grasp the intricacies of their language serves to reinforce the elitist stance that Falleen stand above all other species. Life on the Fringe: On the outskirts of Galactic soci­ ety, the Falleen are best known for their members who serve as the masters of the Black Sun syndicate, which operated out of Mustafar during the Clone Wars. Falleen on the fringe might be connected to these powerful individuals—perhaps having fallen from grace as rising members of the syndicate—or they might be honest members of society who wish to be free of the criminal associations many sen- tients hold about their species. Regardless of their backgrounds, however, many Falleen press their innate advantage, using their manipulative abilities on unsuspecting sentient beings in order to attain lofty positions and wealth with ease. Several atrocities that have occurred on Falleen at the Empire’s hands have bred an intense disdain for the Emperor and his regime within the non-ruling Fal­ leen classes. A handful of Rebel cells, operating out of Silver Station, hidden in the nearby Dragonflower Neb­ ula, use this discontent to recruit Falleen to their cause. Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn Strain Threshold: 1 2 + Willpower Starting Experience: 90 XP Special Abilities: Falleen begin the game with one rank in Charm. They still may not train Charm above rank 2 during character creation. Beguiling Pheromones: By emitting phero­ mones and altering their skin color, Falleen can affect emotional states of other sentients. Once per check as an incidental, a Falleen may suf­ fer 2 strain to upgrade the ability of a Charm, Deception, or Negotiation check against a liv­ ing sentient being within short range once. This ability has no effect on targets wearing breath masks or w ithout respiratory systems. GOTAL The shaggy-haired Gotals are an empathic race of many talents and a benevolent nature. They pos­ sess the extraordinary ability to detect and interpret almost every manner of energy field, which allows them to sense the moods and well-being of nearby living beings. Physiology: Gotals are tall, burly humanoids that evolved as hunter-gatherer tribes on the harsh plains of Antar 4. A coarse, dense layer of fur covers these rugged bipeds in shades ranging from sandy brown to smoky gray. Tiny vestigial nostrils, a pair of beady red eyes, and a wide grimace adorn their gristly, elongated faces. From their heavily knobbed brow sprouts a pair of conical bovid horns packed with millions of nerve clusters sensitive to electromagnetic fields, radio waves, and numerous other forms of energy. Gotals use their energy-detecting horns as their primary sensory organs, since the peculiar conditions of their moon make it difficult to function by sight alone. Gotals use their energy sensitivity to detect the presence, mood, and general wellbeing of nearby living creatures through their electromagnetic aura. On their home, Gotals employ this sensitivity to stalk herds of quivry and other prey-beasts with ease. Their ability to discern the emotions of others through brain wave patterns and other electromagnetic emanations forms the basis of their entire way of life. Society: Antar 4 ’s harsh, unpredictable environment (caused by its complex orbital cycle within a binary star system) forced the Gotals’ primitive ancestors into a nomadic lifestyle. Limited success with planting crops meant the hunter-gatherers of early Gotal civili­ zation had to follow herd beasts during their migration in order to survive. Gotal hunters used their remark­ able ability to detect herds and could discern the type, number, and well-being of animals with aston­ ishing accuracy. Although Gotal settlers have since established several cities around their world, some Gotals reject the settlers’ lifestyle and honor their ancestral traditions by roaming the Antarian plains. These rugged folk roam the highlands and valleys and seldom encounter settlement dwellers in cities like the sprawling Baal Commune. The Gotal’s ability to decipher the emotional state of others using their energy-sensitive horns played a central role in shaping their society. Their proficiency at detecting anger and discomfort produced a natu­ ral aversion to conflict; therefore, Gotals live free of any established government and maintain a peace­ ful anarchy. Awareness of the emotions of everyone around them makes courting rituals unnecessary, and Gotals often fall in love at first sight, remaining monogamous for life. Gotals are typically polite and discreet in their social interactions, avoiding express­ ing negative opinions to keep from upsetting others. There are exceptions, however, and some Gotals use their abilities to take advantage of others, often leav­ ing their world to pursue lives of crime. Gotal children are abrasive and temperamental. From birth, Gotals endure bombardment of every con­ ceivable form of energy emission, unable to filter the incoming stimuli. The sensory overload leaves them helpless, sometimes-causing catatonia or delirium. After infancy, Gotals start learning to cope with their ability, but they still struggle with bouts of instability until they reach maturity around twelve years of age. Although Gotals struggle with the electromagnetic interference given off by electronic devices, they have adapted and achieved space travel capabilities using technology employing emission-free chemical reactions. Gotals used this technology to explore the other moons and planets of their solar system long before encountering other species, and they even established mining outposts on Antar 5 to advance their civilization. Gotals have had millennia to adapt to the overwhelming energy fields wrought by other species that lack their unique abilities, but they con­ tinue to struggle with droid technology. Power sources used in most modern droids emit an energy pattern that causes Gotals particular discomfort, which has created an anti-droid sentiment within Gotal society. Homeworld: Antar 4 is one of six moons orbiting a gas giant in the binary star system known as the Antar system. The complex orbital pattern of moons, planet, and suns causes erratic weather patterns and a con­ stantly changing diurnal cycle. Antar 4 lies along the Nanth’ri Trade Route in the Inner Rim. Antar 4’s land mass consists primarily of breezy grass plains and rocky steppes, but over sixty percent of the moon’s sur­ face is covered in oceans, rivers, and streams. Despite the cool climate, Antar 4 lacks polar ice caps due to a bizarre rotational pattern caused by its steep axis along the Antar system’s orbital plane. This abnormal angle causes extreme tidal shifts that wrack the moon with harsh weather conditions as its seasons change. Frequent eclipses caused by the Antar gas giant and its other moons subject Antar 4 to a highly variable diurnal cycle. At times, Antar’s twin stars, along with the reflectivity of the gas giant’s atmosphere, bathes the entire moon in sunlight that is so bright that it would scorch the optic nerves of most species. Other times, the planet moves between its double stars and this moon, plunging Antar 4 into total darkness. Between these two extremes, the Antarian moons provide varying radiance and wavelengths of illumina­ tion for the Gotal homeworld after nightfall. This wild orbital behavior makes it difficult for anything other than hearty, fast-growing plant life to take root. Language: Antarian primarily relies upon the reading of brain waves and electromagnetic auras to decipher emotions and basic concepts, and supplements this with speech used to convey abstract or complex ideas. To other species, the vocalization of Antarian sounds like a gurgled monotone, but to Gotals it has breadth and inflection thanks to the ever-shifting modulation created by the moods and thoughts of those around them. Due to their ability to detect these emotions with their horns, the Gotal language has no words to express concepts like happiness or sadness. The extra sense Gotals use to communicate makes it impossible for other living beings to speak Antarian fluently. Gotals speak Basic to interact with other species, but using vocalized speech to express emotion is a concept too foreign for most Gotals to grasp. There­ fore, when Gotals use Basic, they speak in neutral terms devoid of any emotion or emphasis. This dull monotone often brings the sincerity of Gotals into question. Superstition that Gotals can read minds also leaves non-Gotals unsettled, widening the rift between species. Life on the Fringe: Gotals have traveled the space lanes for millennia and can be encountered anywhere in the galaxy. Gotals can detect virtually every known frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum, which affords them advantages that make them well suited for a wide variety of careers. Their natural tendency to avoid conflicts makes them excellent business beings, diplomats, negotiators, and politicians. Gotals also frequently enter careers as counselors and psychia­ trists due to their proficiency with reading brain waves and sensing emotions. Cotals seldom fall prey to trickery, so they are renowned as investigators. Coupled with their hunting expertise, Cotals’ special senses make them feared bounty hunters and mercenaries. Some Cotals use their abilities to take advantage of others, prowling the galaxy as cardsharps, soldiers of fortune, and con men. Misconceptions about Cotal mind readers often make people uncomfortable in their presence. Many Cotals prefer to retreat to the fringes of civilization to escape the constant buzz of emotions and alien tech­ nology. For these reasons, it is common to find Cotals working in the Outer Rim and beyond as explorers, prospectors, and scouts.

ANTARIAN RANGERS F or centuries, the Antarian Rangers served as a paramilitary force tasked with assisting the Jedi Order. Rangers were non-Force sensi­ tive beings who performed duties ranging from exploration to resupply, also acting as a provi­ sional fighting force when diplomacy failed. The Antarian Rangers’ ranks consisted of species from all over the galaxy, but the organization originated on the Gotal home of Antar 4. A Gotal named Kaskutal and Jedi Master Marus Timpel founded the Antarian Rangers 620 years before the Battle of Yavin. Kaskutal possessed limited talent with the Force, but the Jedi Order rejected him for training. Undeterred from help­ ing the Order, Kaskutal used his connections to establish a much-needed logistics chain for the Jedi, raising funds to provide supplies and transports. This initiative grew to a galaxy- spanning organization comprised of thousands of beings filling essential support positions for the ever-vigilant Jedi. The prolonged and bloody conflict of the Clone Wars thinned the Rangers’ ranks alongside the Jedi they served. After the Declaration of the New Order, the Empire declared the Antarian Rangers co-conspirators with the Jedi Order and hunted them to near-extinction. Any sur­ vivors slipped into the shadows to escape extermination. Q U A R R E N Persistent and proud, the Quarren are deep-sea dwellers of the oceanic planet Mon Cala, or “ Dac” as it is called in the native Quarren tongue. The distrusting and often paranoid nature of these stubborn aquatic humanoids makes them successful in a wide range of business, political, and underworld professions. Physiology: The Quarren are a sinewy, humanoid species descended from cephalopods, with triangular heads and four tentacles protruding from their faces. A trio of sharp fangs lines their tiny mouths and works in concert with their prehensile face tentacles to com­ municate and feed. Above the cluster of tentacles is a pair of luminous blue or turquoise eyes that other species find intense. This unusual appearance has led to members of many other species referring to them by the derogatory term “squid-faces." Most Quarren possess lithe frames of toned muscle used to navigate their ocean homeworld with ease. Their leathery skin usually presents in subtle variations of pinkish-orange, but some Quarren are a mottled brown or gray-green. Quarren with pink or purple skin are extremely rare and considered wildly beauty­ ful among their species. The average Quarren has five sucker-tipped fingers on each hand, but some individu­ also exist with claws instead of suction cups. Still oth­ ers have only three fingers with suckers or claws. While Quarren are amphibious, they are natural swimmers and are more comfortable breathing underwater. Quarren exemplify resilience, not only in physique but in temperament. Proud to the point of stubborn­ ness, Quarren prefer to adhere to tradition and often reject unnecessary change at all costs. Quarren are cautious and pessimistic, so their culture progresses only through absolute necessity and methodical plan­ ning. This tenacity often leads them to distrust idealistic cultures, creating tension between their species and the Mon Calamari with whom they share their world. Society: For untold ages, the Quarren maintained a peaceful existence at the bottom of the sea on their homeworld of Dac, sometimes interacting with other sentient beings of their world, such as the hive-minded jelly Moappa and the enormous marine mammals, the Whaladons. Their tribal society upheld the traditional ways of their ancestors, mining abundant mineral lodes from Dac’s underwater mountains and spear­ fishing off the coast of small island chains to support their modest civilization. All that changed when the Quarren made first contact with Dac’s other sentient bipeds, the Mon Calamari. The Quarren’s conservative and sometimes cynical nature stood in stark contrast to the Mon Calamari’s tendencies toward creativity, idealism, and optimism. The culture clash between the two soci­ eties proved too much for the Quarren to bear. The antagonistic and territorial Quarren declared war on the Mon Calamari. The brutal and prolonged conflict between the two civilizations ended in the near extermination of the Quarren species. In the wake of their victory, many Mon Calamari attempted to promote peaceful coexis­ tence between the two species, although their societies were largely isolated—the Mon Calamari in their float­ ing cities, and the Quarren in their cities and mining outposts on the seafloor. Deep rifts between the two species remained, the Quarren embittered by their defeat and what they saw as attempts to erase their culture, and the Mon Calamari frustrated by the failure of diplomacy. Tensions boiled over into open conflicts from time to time, although there were also periods of relative peace and cooperation. The Empire’s arrival on Mon Cala has been yet another stumbling block for reconciliation between the two species. Despite their lack of involvement in the fight against the Empire, the Quarren shared the Mon Cal­ amari’s fate for resisting Imperial reign and now live in slavery. For two decades, the Quarren mined value­ able resources in labor camps to feed the ravenous Imperial military-industrial complex. Some Quarren fled their oceanic homeworld to escape the Empire's stranglehold, while others sought refuge undersea in hidden grottos and forgotten mining outposts. Because of the oppression of Mon Cala, many Quarren resist the Empire’s rule, while others work alongside it for their own personal gain. Such matters fall to the individual to decide, but the choice to resist the Empire or collaborate is one of extreme conse­ quence to many Quarren. Fighting the Empire means risking one’s life for the cause, but working alongside it means sacrificing innocent lives to maintain the Empire’s brutal regime. Homeworld: The Quarren are native to the murky ocean depths of Dac, often called Mon Cala. The Outer Rim world is the last stop along the Overic Grip- link beyond the Tion Cluster, and it has been a major exporter of luxury star cruisers for millennia. A vast, planet-wide ocean covers Dac’s surface, with only a handful of islands and coral reefs breaking the waves. Dac supports a thriving marine ecosystem, and the Quarren share their world with several other sentient species such as the cetacean Whaladons and the ide­ alistic Mon Calamari. Immense cities and other population centers both float atop and beneath the seas of Dac. Mon Calamari City, nicknamed “Coral Depths City” by some for its abundance of beautiful multi-colored coral gardens, has districts above and below the surface. It serves as the planet’s seat of government. Other floating metropolises like Foamwander, Fleurkea, Flikahi, Kee- Piru, Orotoru G’am, and Reef Flome drift around the ocean world, each with their own unique architectural designs. Aquarius and other enormous domed cities and mining colonies exist beneath the waves where Mon Calamari, Quarren, and Whaladons live and work together. Even cultural centers like the community of intelligent mollusks known as the Knowledge Bank lie nestled between underwater mountain ranges. Language: Quarrenese, the native language to the Quarren species, is a unique collection of bellowed moans, reedy cries, and bubbly croaks capable of trav­ eling great distances underwater. Without fluid to force through their mantles, Quarren find it difficult to speak Quarrenese in the open air. Because of this, most Quarren also speak Basic with a gravelly, sometimes gurgled, tone when communicating with others above water. Due to their frequent interaction with the Mon Calamari, Quarren also tend to speak Mon Calamarian. Life on the Fringe: Although by nature Quarren are reclusive and prefer to remain on their homeworld, it is common to encounter them throughout the galaxy. Some Quarren feel compelled to leave their world to escape their dependency on the Mon Calamari or their servitude to the Galactic Empire. While not all Quarren are slaves to the Empire, most are wisely dis­ trustful of Imperials. Some Quarren prefer to occupy the fringes of soci­ ety and follow their natural aggression and distrust by seeking work as mercenaries, pirates, slavers, Smugglers, and spies. Flowever, their conservative and meticulous tendencies also make them capable accountants and business managers. Their mistrust­ ing and self-serving nature make them accomplished infochants, politicians, and crime bosses. Many Quar­ ren blame both the Empire and the Rebellion for the destruction that has transpired on their world, disap­ proving of the Mon Calamari’s choice to openly ally with the Rebel Alliance. They try to stay clear of both groups whenever possible. SP E C IE S A B IL IT IE S • Wound Threshold: 10 + Brawn • Strain Threshold: 8 + Willpower • Starting Experience: 95 XP • Special Abilities: Quarren begin the game with one rank in Negotiation. They still may not train Negotiation above rank 2 during character creation. • Amphibious: Quarren can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer movement pen­ alties for traveling through water. • Ink Spray: Quarren can spit ink from a special­ ized sac within their gills that disperses in water, creating a brief murk used to confuse foes or escape predators. This ability can be used on land as well, though it is considerably less effec­ tive because it must be sprayed directly on the target. Once per encounter, as an out-of-turn inci­ dental, a Quarren may suffer 2 strain to add ■ to a combat check made by a character within short range (under water, it adds ■ ■ ■ to the combat check instead). RIVALRIES ABROAD Q uarrens and Mon Calamari have been at odds with one another for eons, despite (or rather, because of) their shared homeworld. Some carry ancient grudges to the fringes of galactic society. Others, however, are simply pleased to see any sentient from their watery home—especially those forced to leave their homeworld during the Clone Wars or another upheaval. An individual Quarren encountering a Mon Calamari in the Outer Rim might well choose to focus on their many similarities rather than the rifts between their species in the past. Players who choose to create Quarren PCs should consider whether their characters are b itter about these old conflicts and still feel animosity toward the Mon Calamari, wish to reconcile with their ancestral neighbors, or do not care about the politics of their homeworld at all in the face of pressing personal issues. Thinking about these issues can help to define individual Quarren characters beyond the widespread stereotypes about their spe­ cies, and helps the CM create interesting hooks for the PC (and the party) to explore. NEW SPECIALIZATIONS T he Smuggler is already one of the most versatile careers introduced in E dge o f the E m p ir e , including the Pilot, Scoundrel, and Thief. These specializations make it easy to create fun and exciting characters, but F ly C a s u a l expands the Smuggler career’s repertoire further than ever before. Joining the existing specializations are three more ways to develop new characters or diversify existing ones. The Charmer combines the oratory gifts of the Politico with the morally questionable bargaining prac­ tices of the Trader to make a sweet talker that few can resist. The Thief’s considerable deceptive talents shuffle in with the negotiating expertise of the Trader to form the devious Gambler who is always ready to deal in, even if he is a few cards short of a deck. The Mercenary Soldier’s gritty determination fuses with the precision of the Assassin to create the Gunslinger. Each of these new specializations showcases the Smuggler’s need to push the envelope and find new ways to thrive on the fringe. Smugglers always have a diverse range of skills at their disposal to represent their bravery and ingenu­ ity in the face of overwhelming odds. The eight career skills inherent to all Smugglers, including the three new specializations, are Coordination, Deception, Knowledge (Underworld), Perception, Piloting (Space), Skulduggery, Streetwise, and Vigilance. Smugglers automatically gain one rank in any four of these skills of his choosing without spending starting experience, and he receives a discount when he spends experi­ ence to purchase ranks in any of these skills. Smugglers are experts at navigating the dense cul­ tural minefield that is the criminal underworld. They know all too well how to save their own skins. Remem­ ber, a character cannot have more than two ranks in any skill at the time of character creation, regardless of how many opportunities he has at receiving free ranks to that skill (such as bonus career skills and spe­ cies bonus skills). C onfident and elegant, the Charmer employs his wits and wiles with more precision than a laser scalpel. Rather than resorting to uncivilized intimida­ tion tactics or distasteful acts of violence, the Charmer believes the best way to get what he wants is to sim­ ply ask for it. A Charmer knows how to talk the talk, possessing natural charisma that makes him irresistible. Struck by the flash of his smile or the wink of his eye, people have a hard time denying anything to the Charmer. T H E S M O O T H O P E R A T O R The Charmer combines the silver tongue of a Politico, the street smarts of a Scoundrel, and the keen mind of a Trader. Where the Politico might rally, chastise, or even bribe to achieve his objective, the Charmer showers his mark with flattery. While the Trader relies on his ability to haggle down a price, the Charmer convinces others that lowering the price is their idea. When a Scoundrel resorts to coercion and violence, a Charmer applies a softer touch to disarm his oppo­ nents with words alone. In addition to the Smuggler’s eight career skills, the Charmer also receives Charm, Cool, Leadership, and Negotiation as bonus career skills. If this is the character’s starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience. The chief weapon in a Charmer’s arsenal is clearly his undeniable charisma. When coaxing his way into a private club or restricted area, the Charmer knows how to compliment without sounding sycophantic. In rare cases when his debonair appearance and refined taste fails him, the Charmer knows how to resort to negotiation and trickery to get his way, doing so with his own smooth brand of flair and style. The Charmer keeps a cool head in the hottest situations, which often serves as inspiration to others, and he has no qualms with taking a leadership role if it furthers his purposes. Whether or not he knows the right thing to say, the Charmer always knows how to say it. Despite all his silvered words, the Charmer is no gilded flower. When all else fails, if the Charmer can­ not diffuse the situation before it escalates, or can­ not convince others to fight in his place, the Charmer holds his own in combat. In a fight, the Charmer can cause opponents to doubt their motives and lower their guard. The Charmer’s Smuggler career gives him the knowledge to navigate the underworld, the ability to escape a jail cell, and the skill to steal a starship for a quick getaway. A Smuggler who chooses Charmer as his special­ ization is an exceptional choice for nearly any cam­ paign. His emphasis on social interaction makes the Charmer handy in any intrigue-oriented campaign, but his Smuggler fundamentals and ability to negotiate with merchants, distract would-be attackers, or diffuse combat encounters make him a welcome addition to underworld- or combat-focused campaigns as well.

I I hen the chips are down, the Gambler holds all the W cards. Like the devious Thief, the Gambler loves misleading others and taking big risks to profit. Like the clever Trader, the Gambler has a knack for convincing others to part with their valuables for next to nothing. The Gambler has a unique variety of tricks up his sleeve to deceive or misdi­ rect opponents, keeping them guessing as to whether he has a winning or losing hand. How­ ever, the Gambler knows that there is no such thing as a losing hand; win­ ning is all about know­ ing how to play the cards that have been dealt. GAMBLER T H E W IL D CARD The Gambler knows how to play all the most popular games of chance; however, he also recognizes there is far more to winning than just knowing the rules. His ability to identify subtle clues in the body language, mannerisms, voice patterns, and behavior of his opponents gives the Gambler all the information he needs to decide when to make his move. The Gambler prides himself on being unpredictable, denying his opponents any hints to his intentions with his stone- cold expression. Whether the situation is a game of sabacc, betting on Podraces, or talking a thug out of blasting his companions, the Gambler has a strategy, and rarely the one people expect. The list of a Gambler’s bonus career skills clearly shows his strong suit lies in sleight of hand and trick­ ery: Computers, Cool, Deception, and Skulduggery If this is the character’s starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending additional starting experience. By doubling down on skills that allow him to keep his opponents guessing, the Gambler ensures the odds are always stacked in his favor. As a competent liar, the Gambler is not above using a skifter to win a hand if the stakes are high enough. A Gambler may not always look like much, but looks can be deceiving. The Gambler is an excellent actor, always able to project an air of calm confidence so he seems as cool as carbonite even when he is as tense as an Alderaanian on an ImpStar. A great Gam­ bler knows to never count his credits at the table, so to speak, but sometimes playing hurt can throw his opponents. Some Gamblers love baiting their oppo­ nents by looking vulnerable just so they can gloat while raking in the pot. A fool and his money are soon parted, and the Gambler is always happy to oblige. The Gambler is a fantastic specialization for playing a number of character types in a variety of settings. A player could create an aboveboard, aristocratic Core dweller participating in high-stakes betting just for thrills; a suave, small-time card shark flitting about the Colonies scamming amateur players; or a downtrod­ den Smuggler dropping his last fifty credits into the pot trying to win enough to repair his ship. He is not limited to playing games, however, as a Gambler fits into any setting where fists full of credits or unbeliev­ able thrills are up for grabs. The negotiation skills of the Gambler could make him the brains of a trade or smuggling operation. A Thief may even supplement his abilities with Gambler to mingle among high soci­ ety and case locations for upcoming jobs.

GUNSLINGER T he Outer Rim is an immense region of countless worlds, sometimes lawless but always dangerous. Life on the galactic frontier teems with vicious crea­ tures and heartless criminals who would not think twice about gunning down innocent civilians. Bred from conflict and necessity, this is the galaxy where the Gunslinger lives and breathes. He is the best there is with a blaster, and he won’t hesitate to show it. T H E Q UICK D R A W The Gunslinger knows better than most that making a living in the Outer Rim Territories is a constant struggle. He needs to be fast on the draw to stay alive. The Gunslinger and his beloved sidearm are inseparable, but he often carries a holdout weapon when stuck in a hos tile, target-rich environment To face off with a Gun­ slinger is a dangerous and foolish proposition. The bonus career skills for the Gunslinger are Coercion, Cool Knowl­ edge (Outer Rim) and Ranged (Light), all of which he uses to survive on the fringe. If this is the character’s starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending addi­ tional starting experience. The Gunslinger has lethal aim and an attitude to match, making him one of the deadli­ est beings in the Outer Rim. A Gunslinger often has a special bond with his favorite weapon. His knack for gunplay often earns him a reputation that puts him at odds with other bandits who want to prove their mettle. This lifestyle is second nature to the Gunslinger, so he knows how to keep his cool when threatened. When some thug sticks a blaster in his face, the Gunslinger doesn’t flinch. He shoots first and skips asking questions. The Gunslinger often needs to remain one step ahead of the law, and so he wanders the Outer Rim in search of his next job. The hard life of the galactic frontier is not all gunfights, so the Gunslinger takes on work wherever he can find it. The Gunslinger uses his underworld contacts to secure odd jobs for a variety of crim­ inal groups. Gunslingers also use their piloting knowledge to take on freight or smuggling jobs. A Gunslinger character can fill countless roles within a campaign. He might find work onboard a bulk freighter defending crew and cargo from pirates. A Bodyguard might opt to pick up the Gunslinger specialization on the side to improve his ability to defend his spoiled Coruscanti debutante client. A Tapani nobleman taking up pistols a duel to maintain the honor of his house might also find the Gunslinger specialization invaluable.

CALL 'EM Activation: Passive Ranked: No Trees: Gunslinger This character does not add any ■ to his combat checks due the use of the Aim maneuver (see page 201 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook). CLEVER SOLUTION Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: No Trees: Gambler Once per game session, the character can choose to make one skill check using Cunning rather than the characteristic linked to that skill. When he does this, he must explain how, in this particular instance, his wiliness helps overcome this challenge. CONGENIAL Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn) Ranked: Yes Trees: Charmer When attempting a Charm or Negotiation check, the character may suffer a number of strain to downgrade the check a number of times equal to the strain suf­ fered. This number cannot exceed his ranks in Conge­ nial. When the character is the target of a Charm or Negotiation check, the character may suffer a num­ ber of strain to upgrade the difficulty of the check a number of times equal to the strain suffered. This number cannot exceed his ranks in Congenial. DISARMING SMILE Activation: Active (Action) Ranked: Yes Trees: Charmer The character can take the Disarming Smile action to make an opposed Charm check against one target within short range. If he succeeds, decrease the tar­ get’s defense (melee and ranged) by a number equal to the character’s ranks in Disarming Smile (to a mini­ mum of 0) until the end of the encounter. DON'T SHOOT! Activation: Active (Action) Ranked: No Trees: Charmer Once per session, the character can take the Don’t Shoot! action to make a Hard ^ ^ ) Charm check If he succeeds, he cannot be the target of a combat check until the end of the encounter or until he makes a combat check. This player must explain how he talks his way out of being associated with his party’s combatants, and the GM has final say on whether his ruse succeeds. DOUBLE OR NOTHING Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: No Trees: Gambler Once per check, the character may suffer two strain to increase the difficulty of the check by one. Then, after canceling opposing symbols, he doubles the number of remaining O DOUBLE OR NOTHING (IMPROVED) Activation: Passive Ranked: No Trees: Gambler When performing the Double or Nothing incidental, after canceling opposing symbols, the character also doubles the number of remaining & DOUBLE OR NOTHING (SUPREME) Activation: Passive Ranked: No Trees: Gambler When performing the Double or Nothing incidental, the character also doubles the number of (J) and FORTUNE FAVORS THE BOLD Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn) Ranked: No Trees: Gambler Once per game session, as an out of turn incidental, the character may suffer two strain to flip one dark side Destiny Point to a light side Destiny Point (this cannot be used to interrupt the spending of a Destiny Point). GUNS BLAZING Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: No Trees: Gunslinger When making a combined combat check with two Ranged (Light) weapons, the character may suffer two strain in order to refrain from increasing the difficulty of the check for attacking with two weapons. JUST KIDDING! Activation: Active (Incidental, Out of Turn) Ranked: No Trees: Charmer Once per round as an incidental, when the character or any of his allies in short range generates ^ on a social skill check, the character may spend one Destiny Point to convert a single ^ generated on the check to Y When he does this, he must explain what he says or does to smooth things over after the verbal misstep. QUICK DRAW (IMPROVED) Activation: Passive Ranked: No Trees: Gunslinger The character may activate the Quick Draw talent twice per round (instead of just once per round). SECOND CHANCES Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: Yes Trees: Gambler Once per encounter, after the character has rolled a skill check (but before resolving the result), he chooses a number of positive dice from his dice pool up to the number of his ranks in Second Chances and re-rolls them. The character must accept the second result. This talent cannot be used to re-roll any O. SORRY ABOUT THE MESS Activation: Passive Ranked: No Trees: Gunslinger The character decreases the critical rating of any non­ starship weapon he wields by 1 (to a minimum of 1) against targets that have not yet acted this encounter. SPITFIRE Activation: Passive Ranked: No Trees: Gunslinger After the character makes a successful combined check with two Ranged (Light) weapons, each addi­ tional hit generated as part of the attack can be allo­ cated to any other target within range of the weapon. UP THE ANTE Activation: Passive Ranked: Yes Trees: Gambler When the character wins at gambling, he earns 10% more credits per rank of Up the Ante. WORKS LIKE A CHARM Activation: Active (Incidental) Ranked: No Trees: Charmer Once per game session, the character can choose to make one skill check using Presence rather than the characteristic linked to that skill. When he does this, he must explain how, in this particular instance, his social ability helps him overcome this challenge. SMUGGLER MOTIVATIONS S mugglers come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and creeds, but something they all have in common is the need for a Reward. It is in the nature of the job; the Smuggler moves the goods, and then he gets paid. The Reward is what drives him to risk his neck, transporting volatile cargo for dangerous people, dodging Imperial interference, and avoiding other trouble. A Smuggler’s life keeps him on the edge of his seat, always one slip away from capture or worse. It’s not an easy life, and he’s only in it for the Reward. Of course, smuggling jobs are rarely as simple as they first seem, and neither are the people who choose such an unpredictable career. The Smuggler’s real motivation, the Reward he really wants, may not be as straightforward as monetary payment. He might wish to earn respect or help his family, or per­ haps he finds excitement of the job its own reward. Any Smuggler needs to receive payment occasion­ ally—he has to keep his ship space-worthy somehow after all—but often there is another, equally pressing goal driving all he does. From the Pilot who wants to break the record for the fastest ship to win the Block­ ade Runner’s Derby to the Charmer who just wants to meet new people to the Gambler who genuinely is only in it for the money, the particular Reward that drives a Smuggler reveals a lot about his character. The Smuggler’s M otivation can also cast a new light on his background, and it plays a part in deter­ mining how he might interact with others in a party. TABLE 1-2: RANDOM SMUGGLER MOTIVATIONS d10 Motivation Results 1-2 A m bition 3 - 4 Cause 5 - 6 Relationship 7 - 9 Reward 10 1 Roll once on each of any two categories A Smuggler motivated by Independence may not like relying on other characters and find making group decisions difficult. On the other hand, a Smuggler motivated by Esteem will likely go out of his way to help his colleagues. Table 1 -2 : Random Smuggler Motivations can be used during character creation or advancement to replace the one in the E dge o f t h e E m p ir e Core Rule­ book, incorporating the new Reward Motivation. The table on the next page, Table 1 -3 : Specific Rewards, gives the specific results for the Reward M otivation. If a player selects Reward or rolls the Reward category at random, he may then roll a ran­ dom specific Reward-driven result or choose the one that best suits the Smuggler character concept he had in mind. d100 Reward Type 01-10 Credits: The Smuggler just wants to get paid. Smuggling is a career after all, and no one works for free. He may be a very successful Smuggler, but is always greedy for more credits. Or maybe he’s just scraping by and reliant on payment for each job before he can repair his ship, feed his crew, and move on to the next contract. Perhaps he wants what he’s owed, fair and square, or maybe dreams of winning big in a sabacc game. In any case, he is in it for the money. Smuggling can be very lucrative if he goes about it the right way and has luck on his side. There is always the chance, particularly in illegal dealings, tha t the em ployer won’t want to pay out. In such cases, the Smuggler with the Credits M otivation does everything he can to claim his due. 11-20 Power: For this Smuggler, success means having the skills, knowledge, credits, prestige, or contacts to wield some real power in the galaxy. Power comes in many forms. He might want to head his own smuggling ring one day, or maybe he hopes to work his way up the ranks of a larger organization like the Black Sun. If a he’s a Charmer, he may feel powerful when manipulating others. If he’s a Thief, it might be when he’s taking their prized possessions. For any Smuggler with this M otivation, the thrill of being im portant, of having power over others as well as his own life, is what drives him. 2 1 -3 0 Victory: This Smuggler enjoys trium phing over others. He challenges himself to fly faster than anyone else, to deceive them, to shoot more accurately than they can, or to steal things out from under their nasal appendages. His need to be be tter than everyone else incites him to be the best Smuggler he can be, but since he might take on particularly dangerous jobs to prove that he can smuggle be tter than anyone else, this M otivation could also be his undoing. 3 1 -4 0 Beating the Odds: Smuggling is not an easy or safe career, but some Smugglers like the challenge of a d ifficu lt job, game, or situation In this case it is true tha t the higher the risk the higher the reward, but the Smuggler still has some tricks up his sleeve to tip the odds more in his favor. When trying to beat the house during a high-stakes game, a Gambler can use skill or even cheat to appear lucky. The Gunslinger facing multiple opponents can use his particular talents to escape unscathed. This Smuggler makes his own luck, and his perilous career allows him to do so. The desired outcome is the satisfaction of succeeding despite the odds. 4 1 -5 0 Fame: This Smuggler wants to make a name for himself. He may take the most dangerous, difficult jobs or seemingly make the impossible happen. However, this means nothing to him unless someone witnesses his success and spreads the word afterwards. The jobs he takes must at least conclude in known space and, ideally, he has an audience when he presents the H utt with the priceless cargo or reunites the wealthy merchant with his long-lost daughter. He wants the adventures that people will talk about from Coruscant to the O uter Rim and beyond. 5 1 -6 0 Esteem: Sometimes a Smuggler just wants to be good at what he does and impress those around him. Similar to Fame, but on a more personal scale, an Esteem M otivation makes a Smuggler crave the good opinion of his peers or the desire of the others. The Smuggler with this M otivation displays bravado in the face of danger, but he also works hard to ensure that his ship and crew are up to the challenging jobs he wants to take. 6 1 -7 0 Experience: The galaxy is a vast and varied place, with a myriad of species and landscapes to encounter. The career of a Smuggler offers a chance to explore, make new contacts, and turn a profit at the same time. It is a great choice of career for anyone who wants to see the galaxy but lacks the funding to do so at his leisure. Any Smuggler who values experience will look for jobs that allow him to learn new skills, try new technology, visit new places, or meet new people. He also likely possesses an eclectic mix of skills and knowledge. 7 1 -8 0 M oral: Sometimes helping others is a reward in itself. Altruism may be a rare virtue, but smuggling attracts all sorts, and being a criminal does not mean the Smuggler has no moral code. A Smuggler might get a kick out of helping others, or he hopes to change the galaxy one good deed at a time. Either way, he wants to feel good about himself based on his own criteria. W hether he gains recognition as a hero or not does not matter. 8 1 -9 0 Excitement: Anyone craving adventure and excitement could easily end up as a Smuggler. For some, the jobs are not work but opportunities for adventure. The career is not dangerous but exciting and challenging. Risking everything in a game of chance delights this character, facing off against an armed opponent thrills him, and pushing his ship to its limits fleeing Imperial forces leaves him laughing like a maniac. Anyone traveling with this Smuggler is in for a wild ride. 9 1 -1 0 0 Independence: N ot everyone thrives under Imperial rule. For some, the ab ility to make their own decisions, and their own mistakes, means everything. This Smuggler wants to choose which jobs to take and which to pass on He pays off debts as quickly as he can, so he is beholden to no one. Ultimately, he wants to be his own boss, which probably means owning his own ship and developing the skills to function independently. TABLE 1-3: SPECIFIC REWARDSSMUGGLER SIGNATURE ABILITIES In addition to career specializations, a character also has access to his career’s signature abilities. These abilities are elite talents only experienced characters of the specified career may access. A character only learns these feats over a long and successful career, separating the journeyman from the master. The Smuggler career has access to two signature abilities: Narrow Escape and Unmatched Fortune. SIG N A T U R E A B IL IT Y B R E A K D O W N A signature ability is composed of three elements: the nodes linking it to a talent tree, the ability’s basic form, and a series of upgrades that augment the ability. NODES Each signature ability has four nodes across its top These four nodes match up with the four talents on the bottom row of a talent tree. Each node can be either active (showing a bracket fac­ ing upward) or inactive (remaining blank.) To be able to attach a signa­ true ability to his talent tree, the char­ acter must own all the talents along the bottom row of the destination talent tree that match up with the active nodes on the signature ability. ABILITY BASIC FORM When a character acquires a signature ability, he must first purchase the basic \ form of the ability. This takes up the entire first row of the signature ability tree. The player purchases it with experi­ ence points just like a talent. The expe­ rience cost of each signature ability is listed in its box. UPGRADES After the character has purchased the basic form of the signature abil­ ity, he can further customize the ability by purchasing upgrades. Upgrades, just like talents, are pur­ chased with experi­ ence points. A player can only purchase an upgrade if it connects to the basic form of the ability or a previously purchased upgrade. The experience cost of each upgrade is listed in its box. A C Q U IR IN G SIG N A T U R E A B IL IT IE S Before a character can purchase a signature ability or any of its upgrades, he must "attach” that ability to the bottom of one of his current in-career talent trees. ____ Once a signature ability has been attached to a tree, no other signa­ true abilities may be attached to that tree, and the attached abil­ ity cannot be removed or switched to a differ­ ent tree. A character can only acquire a signature ability from his career. Sm uggler Signature Ability Tlree: Narrow Escape Once per game session, the character may spend two Destiny Points to make a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Streetwise check. If successful, the character is im­ mediately able to flee from the current personal-scale combat encounter unscathed. The challenge is not overcome or defeated, but the character is able to evade the hazard or threat for the time being. The exact nature of what the character is trying to accomplish, as well as the end results, must be approved by the GM (see Narrative Abilities on page 38), but should be suitably creative or daring. Remove ■ from the skill check to activate Narrow Escape. Affect an additional number of allied characters equal to Cunning per Increase Effect upgrade purchased. Add □ to the skill check to activate Narrow Escape. Narrow Escape can be acti­ vated in a vehicle with the Piloting (Planetary) or Pilot­ ing (Space) skill. Reduce the difficulty of the skill check to activate Narrow Escape to Average Affect an additional number of allied characters equal to Cunning per Increase Effect upgrade purchased. SIG N A T U R E A BILIT Y : N A R R O W ESCAPE Whether a smuggling deal has gone south or the author­ ities see through the ship’s fake transponder code, Smugglers frequently find themselves in a position where they need to make a getaway—and fast. Besides, what good is a reward if nobody gets to spend it? BASE ABILITY Once per game session, the character may spend two Destiny Points to make a Hard Street­ wise check. If he succeeds, the character immedi­ ately flees from the current personal-scale combat encounter unscathed. The challenge is not overcome or defeated, but the character evades the hazard or threat for the time being. The exact nature of what the character is trying to accomplish, as well as the end results, must be approved by the GM (see Narrative Abilities on page 38). When making the skill check to activate Narrow Escape, the GM can add □ or ■ for any situational effects that might cause the check to be easier or more difficult. RUN AWAY! n arrow Escape is fantastic for that moment when the party finds that its trusty space­ craft has been parked in the maw of a giant, hungry creature or for when somebody’s debt collectors have come calling. However, if running away could solve all of one’s problems, most smugglers would live carefree lives. The fact is that Narrow Escape doesn’t so much eliminate most problems as it does defer them. Dodging a bounty hunter today means that he will still be on the trail of the PCs tomorrow, and avoid­ ing an awkward conversation with an estranged relative does little to repair the relationship. When a GM knows that he has a PC with Nar­ row Escape burning a hole in his pocket, he should give the character a chance to use it in memorable ways. The GM should also keep in mind that some encounters can contribute just as much to the story whether the PCs engage with them or avoid them. For instance, when a Smuggler slips past a pair of Black Sun thugs looking to rearrange his face, he might over­ hear their conversation and discover the name of the boss trying to hunt him down. Similarly, giving a PC the chance to make the choice to run away or stay and face an old fear can be as interesting as the actual encounter itself. Narrow Escape can be acti­ vated during social encoun­ ters with the Deception skill. Narrow Escape costs 1 Des­ tiny Point instead of 2. UPGRADES Narrow Escape has several upgrades that can improve its effects and make it easier to use. Any upgrades that appear in Narrow Escape’s tree mul­ tiple times have their effects stack. Add Boost Upgrade: When making the skill check to activate Narrow Escape, the character adds ■ . Change Scale Upgrade: The character can now perform Narrow Escape on a planetary scale, using Piloting (Planetary or Space) to steer a ship out of trouble (instead of the normal Streetwise skill). Change Skill Upgrade: To activate Narrow Escape, the character can use Deception to escape from a social encounter (instead of the normal Streetwise skill). Destiny Upgrade: To activate Narrow Escape, the character only needs to spend 1 Destiny Point instead of the normal 2. Increase Effect Upgrade: When triggering Narrow Escape, the ability may also affect an additional num­ ber of allied characters. The number of characters he can help is equal to his ranks in Cunning times the number of Increase Effect Upgrades purchased. Reduce Difficulty Upgrade: The skill check diffi­ culty to activate Narrow Escape is Average (<0 <}) instead of Hard (<Q> <0>). The GM may still add ■ or □ as the situation warrants. Reduce Setback Upgrade: When making the skill check to activate Narrow Escape, the character removes Q NARRATIVE ABILITIES M any signature abilities have narrative effects, allowing the character to instantly overcome a challenge in his path. These abili­ ties are powerful tools that allow the players and GM to work together to tell a more col­ laborative, cinematic story. However, they can also pose a challenge to the GM if the charac­ ter circumvents sections of his planned story. Because of these potential challenges, when a player wishes to use a signature ability with a narrative effect, he must first consult with the GM. Together, the player and GM decide on the effect the ability should have, fittin g it into the narrative of the game. The GM has final say as to the effect of the ability. Sm uggler Signature Ability Tree: Unmatched Fortune Once per game session as an incidental, the character may spend 2 Destiny Points to change the face of one positive die in the character's dice pool to another face adjacent to it. An "adjacent” face is any die face sharing an edge—not a point—with the rolled face. Unmatched Fortune cannot be used on a O Unmatched Fortune can be used one additional time each game session per Fre­ quency upgrade purchased. Unmatched Fortune affects one additional die per In­ crease Number upgrade purchased. Unmatched Fortune can also be used on the dice pool of a willing ally within short range. Unmatched Fortune affects one additional die per In­ crease Number upgrade purchased. Unmatched Fortune can also be used on negative dice. Increases the maximum range at which Unmatched Fortune can affect willing allies by 1 per Increase Range upgrade purchased. Unmatched Fortune can be used one additional time each game session per Fre­ quency upgrade purchased. SIG N A T U R E A BILIT Y : U N M A T C H ED F O R T U N E Smugglers learn early on to be self-reliant and sure of themselves. It isn’t enough to hope things will work out or believe in some hokey religion—they have to take luck into their own hands if they want to keep flying, much less make a credit or two. BASE ABILITY Once per game session, as an incidental, the charac­ ter may spend 2 Destiny Points to change the face of one positive die in the character’s dice pool to another face adjacent to it. An “adjacent” face is any die face sharing an edge—not a point—with the rolled face. Unmatched Fortune cannot be used on a O . UPGRADES Unmatched Fortune has several upgrades. Any upgrades that appear in Unmatched Fortune’s tree multiple times have their effects stack. Destiny Upgrade: To activate Unmatched Fortune, the character only needs to spend 1 Destiny Point instead of the normal 2. Frequency Upgrade: Unmatched Fortune can be used an additional time per game session equal to ranks in Frequency upgrade. Increase Effect Upgrade: Unmatched Fortune can also be used on negative dice. Increase Number Upgrade: Unmatched Fortune affects one additional die per rank in Increase Num­ ber upgrade. Increase Range Upgrade: Increases the maxi mum range at which willing allies can be affected by a number of range bands equal to the num- a ber of Increase Range upgrades purchased. Shared Luck: Unmatched Fortune can also be used on the dice pool of a willing ally within short range. All upgrades the acting char­ acter has in Unmatched Fortune can be applied to the character receiving heb. Unmatched Fortune costs 1 Destinv Point instead of 2 TRICKS OF THE TRADE L ife on,the fringe is full of adventure and intrigue, occasionally punctuated by mind-numbing terror. ( Fot the skilled and the lucky, however, the payoffs can more than compensate for the close calls and unsavory characters endured in pursuit of riches. Of course, all the spice in Kessel is useless w ithout a way to move it, and a million credits are worthless if a Smuggler is too dead to spend them. "Fighting fair is for suckers. I'd be an idiot to risk my life without stacking the deck firs t” -Alyss Loqui, Smuggler This chapter presents some of the equipment, weapons, vehicles, and starships of interest to Smug­ glers, Gamblers, and Gunslingers in E dge o f the E m p ir e (as well as others who they might not wish to encounter). The galaxy is an oyster waiting to be cracked open. However, every Smuggler knows that keeping his cargo safe and his clients happy takes as much preparation as it does luck. NEW WEAPONS S mugglers, Gamblers, and those just trying to make a dishonest living often deal with greedy Hutts, violent thugs, heartless bounty hunters, and other dregs of the galaxy. Though most Smugglers and cardsharps would prefer not to resort to violence in their business dealings, sometimes it’s unavoidable. When a deal goes bad, having a blaster in hand can be more useful than owning the fastest starship in the sector. While fringers have a whole galaxy of guns and weapons to choose from, certain arms tend to find their way into the hands of those who live by their wits, charm, and reflexes.

They make a human a match for a Wookiee, or a Jawa the equal of an Aqualish (or at least a protocol droid). Having the right blaster for any situation is a crucial part of any Smuggler’s bag of tricks. CZERKA ARMS A95 STINGBEAM Small, easily-concealed energy weapons, stingbeams are among the smallest blasters available. Tiny enough to fit in the palm of the hand, stingbeams work along similar principles to a blaster, but instead of bring a beam of energized particles down a barrel, they focus the blast along a needle-like rod that protrudes between the user’s fingers. Stingbeams can kill at close range, but their blasts quickly lose cohesion over distance. Add ■ ■ to a character’s Perception checks to find a stingbeam on a person’s body. CZERKA ARMS 411 HOLDOUT BLASTER Developed for use by Imperial agents, the 411 hold­ out blaster’s supercharged actuator module and tight muzzle emitter give it impressive range for a holdout blaster. The increased range comes at the cost of overall stopping power when compared to other hold­ out blasters. Though intended for the exclusive use of the Empire, Rebels stole the design specifications and a large shipment of 411 s, flooding the black market with the small, deadly weapons. LIQUIDSILVER L7 LIGHT BLASTER PISTOL A simple, inexpensive blaster pistol, the Liquidsil- ver L7 has developed a reputation among smugglers as a good weapon to have in a pinch. The L7’s com­ pact size, clean lines, and steel finish make the blaster fairly inconspicuous and easy to overlook, especially if stowed for quick and easy access on the wall of a cargo hold or beside the gangplank servos of a light freighter. Add ■ ■ to a character’s Perception checks to notice a Liquidsilver L7 light blaster pistol stashed aboard a starship. MERR-SONN MODEL 53 "QUICKTRIGGER" BLASTER PISTOL Reliable, easy to maintain, and simple to modify, the Merr-Sonn Model 55 “Quicktrigger” blaster pistol has become popular among people living on the fringe. Though not the most powerful blaster available, the Quicktrigger can be readily customized with upgrades and attachments to suit the needs of individual users. Due to its simple design and rugged frame, the Model 55 is relatively easy to maintain and repair, and it rarely suffers more than minor damage from repeated firing. Reduce the difficulty of Mechanics checks to repair a Model 55 or modify attachments on it by one. RAIDER ARMS MODEL-1 "NOVA VIPER" BLASTER PISTOL When weapon designer Joran Raider, the man behind many of the galaxy’s most successful blasters, left BlasTech to start his own small manufacturing firm, it was a blow to the arms giant. Rumors persist that sev­ eral notorious bounty hunters contracted by BlasTech to eliminate its former employee were bought off by Raider with examples of what many believe to be the pinnacle of his craft, the M odel-1 Nova Viper blaster pistol. Perfectly balanced, innovative, and tooled down to a fraction of a micrometer, Raider Arms customizes every Nova Viper sold for its buyer, from its grip to its finish. As such, Nova Viper blasters are highly sought after and cost nearly as much as a new speeder. The blaster’s incredible precision comes with a hidden price as well, requiring careful maintenance and exceptional skill to repair. Nonetheless, a fringer who manages to obtain a Nova Viper would almost invariably count himself lucky and consider it among his most valued possessions. Increase the difficulty of Mechanics checks to repair a Nova Viper or modify attachments on it by one. CZERKA ARMS C-10 "DRAGONEYE REAPER" HEAVY BLASTER PISTOL Based on a custom made design by the infamous bounty hunter Dragoneye, Czerka Arms C-10 heavy blaster pistol has become a popular sidearm for bounty hunters, smugglers, and other fringers who value fire­ power over subtlety. Larger than most other heavy blasters, the Dragoneye Reaper is nearly as lethal as some blaster rifles, and users can easily modify it to suit their needs. While Czerka owns the rights to the Dragoneye Reaper, Caliban’s Model X and SoroSuub “Renegade” heavy blaster pistols share many design elements and bear a striking resemblance to the C-10. HERLOSS HBT-4 HUNTING BLASTER Larger and heavier than most other sporting blaster rifles, the Herloss HBt-4 hunting blaster packs a very heavy punch for a civilian blaster. Designed for hunt­ ing big game and the large, aggressive predators of the Outer Rim, the HBt-4 forgoes the long range of many sporting rifles in favor of a more concentrated blast that disperses relatively quickly. The HBt-4 is most commonly found on rough terrain or tropical worlds with heavy vegetation, where its shorter range is not a handicap. The hunting blaster has also found a place aboard some light freighters where its ready firepower provides an extra sense of security. CORONDEXX VES-700 PULSE RIFLE Often used by urban riot police and bounty hunters, the Corondexx VES-700 pulse rifle has also found a place aboard many of the light freighters roaming the galaxy. Firing a rapid series of micro-bursts in a wide blast pattern, the pulse rifle is particularly effective in closed spaces, such as the corridors of a starship. FELEBRECK DROID DISABLER Produced by Felebreck Electrical Defense Systems, the Droid Disabler is a small but powerful ionization pistol intended to damage, rather than merely inca­ pacitate, droids. Though ineffective at anything but very short ranges, the massive ion blast emitted by a Droid Disabler can permanently fuse the circuits of virtually any unshielded droid, leaving it nothing more than a heap of lifeless scrap. Though devastating to droids and cybernetics, the ion blast doesn’t harm liv­ ing tissue. Due to the compact size of the energy cell and the large power requirements of the weapon, the Droid Disabler can only be fired a few times before the energy pack needs to be replaced. SLUGTH R O W E R S Any pistol or rifle that fires solid projectiles is collo­ quially called a “slugthrower." Considered archaic by most, slugthrowers still have their place in the modern galaxy. Though generally not as powerful or efficient as blasters and other energy weapons, they can be every bit as lethal or even incorporate advanced tech­ nology that wouldn’t be out of place in a starship. FWG-5 FLECHETTE PISTOL Manufactured by Malaxan Firepower Incorporated, the FWG-5 is a smaller, pistol-sized improvement on flechette launchers made by larger firms such as Golan Arms and the Salus Corporation. Firing a small canister or pellet filled with scores of tiny needle-like darts known as flechettes, the FWG-5 is a lethal and terrifying weapon. Effective even against armored targets, the pellets explode with tremendous energy upon hitting from their target, propelling the flech­ ettes to tremendous speeds. Additionally, a laser­ tracking system built into the weapon guides the pellets to their targets, allowing them to make minor adjustments in flight before showering their victims with a hail of deadly flechettes. Though outlawed in many systems, more than a few Smugglers keep an FWG-5 handy at all times. ADOSTIC ARMS 8-GAUGE SCATTER GUN A powerful, large-bore slugthrower produced by Ados- tic Arms, their 8-gauge scatter gun fires a hail of small steel pellets. Though based on primitive slugthrower technology, the weapon’s bestial stopping power rivals that of a heavy blaster pistol. Made of modern, lightweight materials, the scatter gun incorporates a sophisticated recoil system to reduce the weapon’s big kick when fired. Many smugglers and free traders pre­ fer these weapons to blasters for their ability to spray the narrow corridors and airlocks of starships without fear of accidentally penetrating the hull of the vessel. E X P L O SIV E S A N D O T H ER W E A P O N S Sometimes a situation calls for something other than a blaster or slugthrower. Be it a less-than-lethal response to a threat or a weapon meant to intimidate a foe as much as do them physical harm, criminals and fringers have a variety of choices. ASCIAN THROWING DAGGER Named after the binary star system from where they supposedly originated, Ascian daggers are finely weighted and balanced for throwing. Crafted of durasteel and honed to a mono-molecular edge, these blades are deadly in the hands of a skilled user. When making an attack with an Ascian throwing dagger, a character does not increase the difficulty of the check for being engaged with his target as normal. The user adds his Brawn to the listed value (+1) to determine the damage dealt with this weapon. KNOCKOUT GRENADE It is not always necessary or even desirable to kill a threat in order to neutralize it. While stun weapons are the most common nonlethal method of disabling a foe, they are by no means the only way to subdue an opponent. Knockout grenades are one method of incapacitating multiple targets without causing per­ manent damage. Filled with a tranquilizer gas, these grenades can quickly subdue most living things caught in their blast radius, sending them into a deep sleep. Poachers sometimes use grenades such as these to capture wild, dangerous predators, and knockout gre­ nades can even take down large creatures if used in sufficient quantity. Knockout grenades have no effect on targets wear­ ing breath masks or without respiratory systems. SSB-1 STATIC PISTOL Originally developed by long defunct Systech Cor­ poration several thousand years ago, the design was recently revived by SoroSuub as the SSB-1 static blaster pistol. Firing a powerful bolt of electricity gen­ erated by high-energy piezoelectric crystals within the weapon, the static blaster is only useful at close ranges, but a couple of blasts can bring down a Wookiee or even a full-grown gundark. Due to the exceptionally low energy requirements to supercharge the crystals, energy packs in static pistols can power the weapon through thousands of firings. Flowever, the internal alignment of the crystals is very exact, and the pistol can stop functioning if damaged or roughly handled. TAGGECO. CRYOBAN PROJECTOR These devices were originally designed to extinguish fires aboard starships using a supercooling chemical agent, but independent operators quickly discovered that removing the safety nozzles from CryoBan pro­ jectors could turn them into lethal weapons. Many smugglers keep several of these stashed in strategic locations around their ships, both to put out fires and, if necessary, repel boarders. CryoBan projectors can be used to fight fires. A character armed with a CryoBan projector adds □ to attempts to put out a fire. Assisted checks to extin­ guish the flames add one additional □ for each assist­ ing character equipped with a CryoBan projector. B R A W L W E A P O N S Most smugglers prefer not to come to blows, but should a brawl be unavoidable, the smart ones won’t be caught empty-handed. SHOCK BOOTS Though shock gloves are fairly common among criminals and law enforcement personnel alike, shock boots are a specialty item crafted for those who are determined not to be caught defenseless under any circumstances. A solid kick from these boots activates the miniature power generators and electrical circuitry in their soles, delivering a paralyzing shock to an opponent. Generally indistinguishable from normal boots, few notice shock boots’ dangerous capabilities until it’s too late. Shock boots are worn on the feet, and thus do not require a hand to wield. Add ■ to a character’s Perception checks to notice that shock boots are a weapon rather than merely normal footwear.

Anybody with a few credits has access to a staggering variety of blades and cud­ gels, but a few styles have proven perennially popular among smugglers and gamblers. PUNCH DAGGER A punch dagger, also known as a push dagger or gim­ let knife, is a small, short-bladed knife attached to a T-shaped handle, or “gimlet.” The user grasps the gimlet so the blade protrudes between his fingers. Easily-concealed, the punch dagger allows the user the put considerable force behind a thrust, often piercing thick clothing and simple armor. A favorite holdout weapon among gamblers, a punch dagger typically won’t set off the weapons detectors used in many gambling dens and the backrooms of cantinas throughout the galaxy. Add ■ ■ to a character’s Perception checks made to find a punch dagger on a person’s body. VIBRORAPIER A long, slender-bladed vibrosword, a vibrorapier is extremely well-balanced and suited for professional artists of the blade. Designed primarily for thrusting, the vibrorapier can penetrate virtually any armor, making it an exceptionally deadly blade in the hands of trained sword-wielder. Unlike other vibroblades, which emit an audible hum, vibrorapiers are com­ pletely silent, making them useful for those who rely on stealth to survive. BLADE-BREAKER Designed to be used in conjunction with a vibrosword or other melee weapon, the blade-breaker is typically a small, serrated vibroblade or pronged dagger capable of catching and possibly even breaking an opponent’s melee weapon. Equipped with an ultrasonic generator in the handle to increase the weapon’s ability to shatter durasteel, a blade-breaker can quickly leave an oppo­ nent unarmed and at the mercy of its wielder. NEW ARMOR W hile most smugglers and gamblers eschew don- ning obvious forms of armor, few would neglect their personal defenses altogether. Many smugglers choose armor that allows for freedom of movement and accentuates their personal style. BLAST VEST Light armor designed to protect the wearer from bullets and flying debris, militia and planetary defense forces commonly wear blast vests, as do troopers and crew­ men aboard starships. Protecting just the torso of the wearer, blast vests leave the limbs uncovered, allow­ ing for unhindered freedom of movement. While the vest provides excellent protection from flying debris, shrapnel, and projectile weapons, the materials are not designed to stop energy blasts, providing minimal defense against blasters and other energy weapons. The armor gains + 2 soak when the wearer suffers damage from a slugthrower or other physical projectile. MIMETIC SUIT A combination of highly advanced materials and applied sciences, mimetic suits are the apex of per­ sonal cloaking technology. Able to bend light around the wearer to make him virtually invisible, the suit also contains sound dampeners, as well as electromagnetic and heat shielding, to make him even stealthier. While other stealth suits rely principally on special materi­ also, mimetic suits must actually be energized in order to cloak the wearer, and they require a small power pack, generally affixed to the belt, to function properly. The power packs are usually only good for an hour of continuous use before they need to be switched out or recharged. Illegal to own and difficult to obtain, mimetic suits are much sought after by criminals, thieves, and assassins throughout the galaxy. Upgrade the ability of Stealth checks the wearer makes while wearing a mimetic suit twice while it is active. The GM may spend <§> <§) <§) or ^ on any Stealth check the wearer makes while the suit is active to have the battery run out of energy, causing the suit to stop functioning until it is replaced. TABLE 2-3: ARMOR SMUGGLER'S TRENCHCOAT Every smuggler gets searched; that part of the job is inevitable. Some smugglers, however, take the tact that if they simply have enough hidden compart­ ments, at least a few will inevitably go unsearched. The smuggler’s trenchcoat addresses this strategy, and is covered with pockets, minor compartments, and pouches within pouches to confound any search. Checks made to find anything hidden within a smug­ gler’s trenchcoat while it is being worn are opposed by the Skulduggery of the wearer. The coat can con­ ceal up to 2 encumbrance worth of items.

Having the right gear to get the job done is essential, whether that means keeping cargo safe or “liberating” it from oth­ ers. Gamblers constantly search for ways to stack the odds in their favor, and even Gunslingers need more than a blaster to succeed in their trade. C Y B ER N ET IC E N H A N C E M E N T S Relatively common among the law-abiding popula­ tion, cybernetics and inorganic limbs and organs are even more prevalent among those who make their liv­ ing skirting galactic law. Smugglers often sport more than their fair share of pieces of integrated technology, whether they adopted cybernetics to replace limbs lost on the job or even to gain the edge over competitors. APPRAISER'S EYE To negotiate with clients successfully, a smuggler must be able to recall the rough market value for a stagger­ ing number of goods on dozens, if not hundreds, of dif­ ferent worlds. While most smugglers simply develop a sense for such things, certain discerning individuals find estimates to be far too imprecise. An appraiser’s eye is a combination scanner and cross-reference tool in the form of a cybernetic eye or lens implant. In addition to identifying most goods quickly and accu­ rately, it constantly records commodity prices on the planets its wearer visits, and offers past data points as well as market trends on the items in question. An appraiser’s eye provides automatic O on Nego­ tiation and Streetwise checks to buy or sell items. Models Include: Neuro-Saav Technologies Q28, Votan Industries 2b Appraiser’s Eye. CYBERNETIC CAVITY Some smugglers go to great lengths to conceal value­ able cargo, including hiding it in their own bodies. While smuggling goods and spice strapped to the body or swallowed for later retrieval is not uncom­ mon, some smugglers have found it expeditious to move goods inside small containers surgically implanted into their bodies or even incorporated into cybernetic limbs. While a full body search or holoscan might reveal the presence of a cybernetic cavity, it is practically unnoticeable on casual inspection and is likely to be missed by many scanners. A cybernetic cavity provides 1 rank of the Hid­ den Storage talent (see page 1 37 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook). A character with this cyber­ netic can use the Hidden Storage talent to conceal items within his own body. Models Include: Various models. DIGITAL LOCKPICK Some smugglers and thieves find that it pays not only to keep a lockpick in hand in a figurative sense, but also in a more literal fashion. A digital lockpick is a cybernetic appendage, usually a finger, equipped with a number of small tools that assist in cracking both physical and electronic locks. A digital lockpick provides 1 rank of the Bypass Security talent (see page 1 33 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook). Models Include: Celta-corp “Jailbreak” cyberpick. DETECTIO N D EV IC ES As a rule, smugglers dislike surprises. As such, they have a sort of love-hate relationship with devices whose primary purpose is detection. On one hand, these machines can be very useful for spotting and avoiding any unwanted entanglements. Conversely, most smugglers would prefer that their own presence and illicit cargo remain undetectable. HOLOSCANNER Used in spaceports and high-security locations through­ out the galaxy, holoscanners can detect the presence of dangerous or illegal items without the need to physi­ cally search individuals or cargo containers. Using a combination of sensors, energy receptors, and holo- imaging, these large scanners detect and identify virtu­ ally any form of weaponry or illicit contraband. While some rare materials, such as cortosis or nightshadow, can foil holoscanners, vigilant operators watch for such obfuscation. Holoscanners come in various shapes and sizes, from small screens for inspecting individu­ also to massive machines designed to examine speeder trucks, cargo containers, and even light freighters. Holoscanners reduce the difficulty of Perception or Vigilance checks to discover concealed items on a person or in a container or vehicle by two. A holoscan- ner cannot typically scan an item or group of items with encumbrance higher than its own. Models Include: BAS44 customs-grade holoscan- ner, Fabritech HB-2 holoscanner, TaggeCo. SecureScan 1 500, Neuro-Saav Technologies 7320/H scanning array.

Whether securing their own personal safety and illicit valuables, or bypassing the security measures put in place by others, the thieves and guards alike employ physical precautions and electronic safeguards. LOCKPICKING TOOLS While most locks in the galaxy rely on an electrical component, there exist locations and cultures with­ out a steady supply of electricity. Unexpected loss of power can also mean that formerly electronic locks must be manipulated manually. In these cases, more archaic options are available to thieves and smugglers looking to surreptitiously breach physical security, including laser lockpicks and vibropicks. Models Include: Various unbranded models. SHIFT COFFER Also called “ Bith hiding cubes,” these transparisteel cubes are about three-quarters of a meter on each side, and function as small safes designed to be invis­ ible to the naked eye. Originally designed by Bith engineers, the walls of the coffer contain special fiber optic relays that transfer the light around the cube across its surface. When placed flush into a niche in a wall, the shift coffer disappears, blending perfectly into the surrounding plane of the wall. When out in the open, the coffer refracts light around itself but creates an odd blurring effect akin to heat haze. Shift coffers can contain up to a total 5 encum­ brance in items, though items more than about half a meter in length do not fit inside (at least, not without being bent or folded). When the coffer is in its wall niche, attempts to discover it require a successful For­ midable * 3ercePt'on c^ ec^ The locks on shift coffers are usually good but not extremely complex or sophisticated, requiring a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ > Skulduggery check to pick.

MAGNA-LOCK SAFE The best personal safes on the market are those crafted from multiple bonded layers of high-quality durasteel and equipped with magna-locks. The doors of these safes seal with special locking mechanisms that gen­ erate micromagnetic fields, creating covalent bonds nearly as strong as those of the surrounding durasteel. Though the sizes of these safes vary, most store about 10 encumbrance. Cracking a magna-safe requires specialized tools, and even with these, open­ ing it requires a Formidable ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Skuldug­ gery check Models Include: Locris Syndicated Securities DT-1 25 magna-safe, Chirrit & Chirrit Series 89 “Steel Sentry” executive safe. SHADOWCLOAK Shadowcloaks are peculiar devices designed to protect a user’s anonymity during meetings in person. When activated, a shadowcloak generates a field of conceal­ ing darkness around its user, causing him to appear as nothing more than a black mass of shadows, even in bright light. In addition to hiding the user from sight, the shadowcloak field also baffles most sensors and scanners, and distorts the user’s voice, ensuring his identity remains a secret. The shadowcloak field is relatively static and inflexible once activated, and the user cannot walk or move around too much without revealing his identity. Additionally, the power require­ ments of the field only allow the device to operate for an hour before it must cool down and recharge for four hours. Normally, the user will sit down somewhere and activate the shadowcloak just prior to a meeting. Discerning any identifiable features of a character wearing a shadowcloak requires a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ Perception check Models Include: Tenloss SX-1 shadowcloak, Creshal- dyne Industries “StaticShadow” generator. FINGERPRINT MASQUE For those who are serious about keeping their identity unknown, fingerprint masques are essential. A thin, liq­ uid-crystal biometric screen applied to the fingertip, a fingerprint masque creates a random fingerprint pattern or mimics known patterns. Advanced masques can also be embedded with false DNA in order to circumvent more sophisticated biometric scanners and readers. Fingerprint masques can fool basic fingerprint readers with nothing more than an Easy (^ ) Cool or Deception check, while more advanced scanners require an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) or Hard check, at the GM ’s discretion. If the biometric scanner operator has reason to be suspicious of a character wearing a fingerprint masque, it may require an opposed social skill check versus the operator’s Computers skill. A character must make a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Percep­ tion check to actually notice the physical presence of a fingerprint masque on an individual’s fingers. Models Include: Numerous variants. TO O LS The implements of a rogue’s trade are varied, both exotic and mundane, and smart operators always make sure that they have the right tools for the job. FALSE CREDENTIALS In the vast police state of the Galactic Empire, a lack of proper identification can draw unwanted atten­ tion from Imperial authorities. However, for those who would rather keep their actual names to themselves, false identities and the accompanying credentials can be obtained for a price. Clever forgers and slicers create false credentials, counterfeit licenses, and fake permits embedded on standard electronic identification cards that can fool even the most sophisticated holoscanners. False credentials can fool most cursory examina­ tions, and characters using scanners require a suc­ cessful Hard Computers check to recognize the credentials as fakes (or a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Perception check without equipment). Models Include: Numerous variants. SKIFTER Perhaps the most common means of cheating at sabacc, a skitter is a rigged card. Like genuine sabacc cards, skitters have an electronic display that can shift to show any suit or value. However, unlike normal cards, charac­ ters can program a skitter to display any suit or value he wants, often by simply tapping at the corner of the card. By surreptitiously slipping the card into his hand in place of one provided by the dealer, a cardsharp can gain a distinct advantage—so long as he isn’t caught.

These small, hand-held scanners can quickly catalog cargo and calculate its mass, volume, and dimensions. By programming in the shape and size of a ship’s cargo holds, a cargo scanner computes the most effi­ cient method of loading and stowing freight. A character using a cargo scanner may make an Average ^ ) Computers check to increase the available encumbrance capacity of a planetary vehicle or starship with a silhouette of 5 or more by 10 percent (rounding up) thanks to more efficient organization. Models Include: Fabritech A-11 cargo scanner D R U G S Valuable and easily transported, spice is a commodity regularly moved by Smugglers. While most profession­ also avoid sampling their cargo, especially if that cargo belongs to a Hutt or Black Sun, some succumb to temptation, and a few become dangerously addicted. IMPACT Derived from the extract of the nysillim plant of Felu- cia, impact has grown in popularity in recent years among smugglers and other starship pilots. Though nysillim spice is primarily used for its healing and pal­ liative properties, when concentrated and cooked into impact, it has a dramatic effect on the user’s reflexes. However, after a short while, the effects of the spice end in a lethargic crash. Impact use is on the rise despite Imperial attempts to crack down on the spice. A dose of impact lasts for one encounter and allows the user to upgrade the ability of any Agility-based checks until the end of the encounter. After the effects of impact wear off, the character suffers ■ to any Agility-, Cunning-, or Intellect-based checks for the remainder of the game session. MUON GOLD Made from engine lubricant subjected to an intense bombardment of muons, muon gold is a designer spice that provides the user a sense of mental focus and reduces inhibitions. Popular among smugglers and other rogues who rely on their wits, long-term abuse of muon gold can result in severe degradation of the neural pathways, reduction of cognitive abilities, and even dementia. Because of its particular qualities, muon gold is especially tempting to many smugglers who might normally avoid sampling their own wares. A dose of muon gold lasts for one encounter and allows the user to add □ to all Cunning- and Presence- based checks until the end of the encounter. At the GM’s discretion, repeated use of the spice can cause cognitive impairment, imposing temporary or lasting® to a character’s Intellect- and Cunning-based checks. W E A P O N A T T A C H M EN T S Most outlaws modify their weapons to provide that extra advantage should a situation come to a fight— or to end a fight before it can even start. OVERCHARGE VALVE An overcharge valve is a simple (if dangerous) modifi­ cation that allows the wielder of a blaster to discharge the entire ammunition reserve in a single, devastating shot. This attachment can be applied to any blaster or energy weapon that could logically benefit from it. Models Include: Czerka “One-Shot” Overcharge Valve. Base Modifiers: As an incidental, the wielder may have the weapon gain the Prepare 1 quality and increase its damage by 4 for the next attack he makes with it. After firing, the weapon runs out of ammunition (see page 207 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook). Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 2. Price: (R) 1,500 credits. PAIRED WEAPONS Many Gunslingers wield a pistol in each hand, and some flashy pirates and other scoundrels even prefer to pair a blade with a pistol. This weapon modification balances a pair of weapons, allowing the wielder to use them in perfect tandem. This attachment can only be applied to one-handed weapons. Models Include: Custom variants. Base Modifiers: Must be applied to two weapons at the same time. Reduces the O required to hit with the secondary weapon when two-weapon fighting with this pair of weapons by 1. Modification Options: None Hard Points Required: 1 (per weapon) Price: 300 (for the pair). SET TRIGGER Commonly known as a “hair-trigger,” this weapon retool­ ing allows a blaster or slugthrower to fire with barely a touch of the trigger. This attachment can be applied to any Ranged (Light) or Ranged (Heavy) weapon. Models Include: Custom variants.

UNDERSLUNG SCATTERGUN An ungainly attachment, an underslung scattergun is a single-shot slugthrower that can be attached to another weapon. While hardly what one would call subtle, it nonetheless has found a ready market amongst some bounty hunters and gunslingers due to its low cost and impressive effect. This attachment can only applied to pistol and rifle-sized weapons.

With thousands of manu­ facturers producing tens of thousands of models of planetary vehicles and starships, the galaxy teems with myriad means to smuggle goods and people. A IR S P E E D E R S The air between ground and space can be a danger­ ous place for smugglers and other fringers, and haul­ ing goods across light years is of no value if one cannot make it the last few kilometers. Whether facilitating the transfer of cargo to and from orbit or policing the airspace over a planet, airspeeders are an unavoid­ able part of a smuggler’s business. HSP-10 PURSUIT AIRSPEEDER Once a common sight in the skies of Coruscant and other Core Worlds, the HSP-10 pursuit airspeeder is being phased out in favor of newer models, though it is still widely used by Imperial and local planetary security forces beyond the Inner Rim. A relatively fast airspeeder, the HSP-10 carries adequate firepower to deal with most lawbreakers, including a forward- mounted ion cannon to disable the vehicles of any fleeing suspects. Security agencies often patrol the airspace around spaceports with these airspeeders, as well as respond to incidents reauirine close air suooort. Vehicle Type/Model: Airspeeder/HSP-10.

CARGOHOPPER 102 CARGO LIFTER A small airspeeder designed to transfer cargo to and from smaller spaceports and locations inaccessible to large freighters and transports, the Cargohopper 102 is a familiar sight throughout the galaxy. Capable of vertical takeoff and landing and relatively easy to handle with little or no training, these cargo lifters are a vital part of galactic trade, as well as a necessity for smugglers doing business in remote systems and sectors. The Cargohopper 102 comes equipped with a small, industrial-grade tractor beam to aid in the loading and unloading of cargo. Vehicle Type/Model: Cargo Lifter/Cargohopper 102. Manufacturer: TaggeCo. Maximum Altitude: 300 kilometers. Sensor Range: Short. Crew: One pilot. Encumbrance Capacity: 75 Passenger Capacity: 0. Price/Rarity: 1 4,500 credits/3. Customization Hard Points: 0.

L A N D S P E E D E R S The primary means of transportation on most planets throughout the galaxy, landspeeders and other low- flying repulsorcraft fill many roles in daily life and com­ merce. From high-performance swoop bikes to rumbling speeder trucks, there are many makes and models driven by legitimate operators and shady fringers alike. HYPERFOIL lOOO-XTC The Hyperfoil 1000-XTC’s unusual hybrid design com­ bines repulsorlift drives and air-cushioned hovercraft engines. Capable of true vertical take-off and landing, the Hyperfoil can achieve a moderately high altitude fora landspeederand boasts powerful engines, smooth handling, and an impressive cargo capacity. Vehicle Type/Model: Landspeeder/1000-XTC. Manufacturer: Tion Industries. Maximum Altitude: 50 meters. Sensor Range: Short Crew: One pilot. Encumbrance Capacity: 25. Passenger Capacity: 2. Price/Rarity: 7,000 credits/5. Customization Hard Points: 5. Weapons: None. STARHAWK SPEEDER BIKE A tried and true design, the Ikas-Adno Starhawk speeder bike is popular throughout the galaxy, uti­ lized by everyone from smugglers and swoop gangs to merchants and moisture farmers. Rugged and reliable, Starhawks appeal to those who desire a powerful speeder bike as well as those looking for a relatively inexpensive workhorse. Though technically classified as a speeder bike, the Starhawk’s powerful engine pushes it into the swoop category, though it is unable to achieve the altitude of most swoops. The Starhawk has an unusual feature: it can be fitted with a sidecar, allowing it to carry an additional passenger or transport extra cargo. The speeder bike also comes equipped with a rear tractor beam coupler to allow it to tow a repulsorsled for even more cargo capacity. Vehicle Type/Model: Swoop/Starhawk. Manufacturer: Ikas-Adno. Maximum Altitude: 1 5 meters. Sensor Range: Close. Crew: One pilot. Encumbrance Capacity: 5 [1 5 with sidecar). Passenger Capacity: 1 (2 with sidecar). Price/Rarity: 2,000 credits (2,500 with sidecar)/3. Customization Hard Points: 2 (1 with sidecar) Weapons: Light tractor beam coupler (Fire Arc Aft; Damage Critical Range [Close]; Tractor 1). SUNRUNNER ZX LANDSPEEDER An armored variant of the civilian Sunrunner land- speeder produced by Ikas-Adno, the Sunrunner zX has seen limited success among militias and planetary secu rity forces in the Mid and Outer Rim Territories. Compact and maneuverable, the Sunrunner zX works well as an urban combat vehicle. Flowever, it lacks the heavy armor and armament needed to fulfill any role on the battle­ field besides reconnaissance, resulting in very few exam­ ples in military service. While shunned by the Imperial armed forces, the low price tag of the speeder makes it popular among small police forces, as well as smugglers and other criminals looking for extra firepower. Vehicle Type/Model: Landspeeder/Sunrunner zX. Manufacturer: Ikas-Adno. Maximum Altitude: 2 meters. Sensor Range: Close. Crew: One pilot, one gunner. Encumbrance Capacity: 1 2 Passenger Capacity: 1 Price/Rarity: 8,500 credits/5. Customization Hard Points: 3. Weapons: Turret-mounted, light blaster cannon (Fire Arc All; Damage 4; Critical 4; Range [Close]). NEW STARSHIPS F or those who travel the space lanes skirting the law and imminent disaster, a fast, reliable ship is the foremost requirement. Manufacturers produce thousands of spacecraft across the galaxy, from the customizable ships of Corellia to the sturdy vessels of Kuat to the reliable craft of Rendili. S T A R F IG H T E R S A N D PATROL BO ATS Though not of particular use to most smugglers due to their small cargo capacity, starfighters and patrol boats are still of concern to those who live and work on the edges of society, mainly because of the need to evade or outrun them. ALPHA-CLASS XG-1 "STAR WING" ASSAULT GUNBOAT Designed by Cygnus Spaceworks, the Alpha-class Xg-1 assault gunboat is a multipurpose starfighter, excelling at space and planetary attack, interdiction, and long- range reconnaissance and patrol. Unlike the more com­ mon TIE series, the/Vp/?a-class is equipped with heavy armor, deflector shields, and hyperdrives, though these come at the cost of speed and maneuverability, mak­ ing it a less than stellar dogfighter. Heavily armed, the Star Wing is more than a match for most threats, dis­ abling them with its ion cannons to allow for boarding actions or blasting them out of space with its lasers and concussion missiles. While used primarily by the Impe­ rial Navy, Star Wings have begun to be employed by Imperial Customs and some planetary defense forces. Hull Type/Class: Assault Starfighter//\/p/?a-class.

IMPERIAL CUSTOMS FRIGATE Though designated as a frigate, Imperial Customs employs this ship as a large patrol boat to police the space lanes and starports of the Empire. Well-armored and -armed, the ship can contend with most pirates and smugglers it is likely to encounter. Imperial Cus­ toms frigates are typically captained by a customs inspector (see page 397 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook), with a pilot, engineer, comms officer, and a squad of troopers. While customs frigates typically operate alone or in pairs, they sometimes provide sup­ port for the larger light corvettes operated by the Impe­ rial Customs Office (see page 74 for more information). Pirates who manage to get their hands on a customs frigate will often use them to stop and capture freight­ ers and transports without ever firing a shot.

VT-49 DECIMATOR A heavily armed transport and assault ship used primarily by the Imperial Navy, the VT-49 Decimator is a fearsome foe for smugglers and pirates who come under its guns. Used for long-range reconnaissance, picket duty, and ground and shipboard assaults, the VT-49 is a versatile vessel. Though used principally by the Imperial Navy, these fast, wedge-winged attack ships have also been adopted by other quasi-military arms of the Galactic Empire, from Imperial Customs to the dreaded Imperial Security Bureau.

F R E IG H T E R S A N D T R A N S P O R T S W ithout freighters and transports, galactic com­ merce would grind to a halt and smugglers would be unable to move their illicit cargo. A home, a live­ lihood, and occasionally a getaway vehicle, finding the right ship is im portant for any smuggler. CEC WUD-500 STAR YACHT A luxury craft intended to complement Corellian Engi­ neering Company’s extensive line of light freighters, the WUD-500 star yacht was engineered with fea­ tures and design principles directly inspired by the highly successful YT-series. Smaller than the YT-1 300, the WUD-500 has a saucer-shaped hull with an in-line cockpit jutting from the front. Though fast and highly customizable, the WUD-500 proved relatively unpop­ ular outside of the Corellian sector and was unable to compete with more well-known luxury yachts from SoroSuub and Kuat Drive Yards. Eventually discontin­ ued, the WUD-500 found renewed life on the after- market among smugglers and free traders. Hull Type/Class: Yacht/WUD-500. Manufacturer: Corellian Engineering Corporation.

STARLIGHT-CLASS LIGHT FREIGHTER A joint venture of the venerable Rendili StarDrive and Surron StarTech, the Starlight-class light freighter is a hybrid of human and Surronian design and technol­ ogy. Renowned for their innovative starship designs, the insectoid inhabitants of Surron lacked the busi­ ness and marketing savvy to make much of an impact on galactic markets, and a partnership with Rendili seemed mutually beneficial. From early on, major dif­ ferences in design philosophies marred the project, ensuring that the Starlight was the first and last vessel produced by the Rendili-Surron union. Nonetheless, the final production version of the Starlight-class is a unique freighter that has seen some limited success. A large forward-swept wing with a Corellian-inspired cockpit and cylindrical hull on the starboard side, the Starlight-class light freighter is virtually impossible to mistake for any other ship traveling the space lanes. A sophisticated repulsorlift loading platform makes the freighter incredibly quick and efficient at loading and unloading cargo. While possessing a spacious cargo hold, the substandard materials used by Rendili to cut costs resulted in a fairly weak frame, limiting the weight of goods the freighter can safely carry. In spite of its shortcomings, the Starlight-class has found a niche among free trad­ ers and smugglers. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/Stor//g/?f-class.

YKL-37R NOVA COURIER The last ship produced by Gallofree Yards before its bankruptcy, the YKL-37R Nova Courier was a last ditch effort to save the struggling starship manufacturer. Intended to compete with Corellian Engineering’s series of light freighters, few Nova Couriers were sold prior to Gallofree Yards’ closure. Bankers overseeing the company’s liquidation auctioned off its vast stock of YKL-37Rs for bargain prices, many ending up in the hands of free traders, smugglers, and pirates. Unlike several of Gallofree’s previous freighters, which were plagued by problems, the Nova Courier is a reliable and well-armed vessel, something appreciated too late to save the troubled shipmaker. Though lacking the cargo capacity of other light freighters, the Nova Courier’s speed, handling, excellent stock armaments, and ease of maintenance and modification more than make up for that shortcoming. Hull Type/Class: FreighterT/KL-STR Nova Courier. Manufacturer: Gallofree Yards, Inc. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 2. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Short.

GX1 SHORT HAULER Originally designed by Lantillian Shipwrights as an affordable yet luxurious pleasure craft, the GX1 is easily converted into an excellent short hauler by removing most of its guest rooms and amenities to make way for additional cargo holds. The CX1 never met its sales forecasts, but the vessel’s solid engineer­ ing and reliability make it attractive to free traders and smugglers on a budget. Though equipped with adequate shields and armaments, most owners living on the fringe opt to upgrade the ship’s weaponry for added defense against pirates and other dangers. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/GX1 Short Hauler. Manufacturer: Lantillian Shipwrights. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 1 2. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Short.

BAUDO-CLASS STAR YACHT Custom built by the small shipyard of the reclusive and eccentric Aqualish Mendel Baudo, each B a u d o - class star yacht is a unique work of art. Extremely popular among the wealthy elite of the galaxy, these ships are prized as much for the status they convey as for their exceptional speed and craftsmanship. Taking only commissions from the referrals of previous cli­ ents, Baudo engineers all of his yachts along similar lines, customizing the vessels’ interiors and finishes to meet the demands of his clientele. As a result, every B a u d o -class is a sleek, fast star yacht of roughly the same size and shape, with the opulent internal archi­ tecture and luxurious amenities of the finest quality to suit the tastes of the individual owners. Hull Type/Class: Yacht/Bot/c/o-class. Manufacturer: Mendel Baudo Shipyards. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 12. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Short.

MOBQUET MEDIUM TRANSPORT Manufactured by M obquet Swoops and Speeders, a company that, as its name suggests, is more known for personal repulsorlift vehicles like the Flare-S, their medium transport is a popular cargo hauler. TaggeCo. does significant business with the Galactic Empire, and so its subsidiary M obquet managed to get this vessel designated as a medium transport rather than a bulk freighter or heavy cargo hpuler, thereby avoiding many of the restrictions normally imposed on a vessel of its size. Hull Type/Class: Transport/MMT. Manufacturer: Mobquet Swoops and Speeders. Hyperdrive: Primary: Class 2, Backup: Class 15. Navicomputer: Yes. Sensor Range: Short.

COZANTI-CLASS ARMED TRANSPORT Built for durability and firepower over speed and cargo capacity, the Gozanti-c\ass cruiser is a peculiar trans­ port intended to escort unarmed bulk container ships and provide anti-piracy capabilities to freighter con­ voys. Introduced by Corellian Engineering Corporation nearly half a century ago, the company generally sub­ contracted out the actual construction of the Gozanti to smaller shipbuilders, notably Gallofree Yards, Inc. Intentionally designed to be too slow for use by pirates, the Gozanti cruiser is typically used by corporations and traders transporting valuable goods or individuals.

CORELLISPACE GYMSNOR-3 LIGHT FREIGHTER Produced by CorelliSpace, a well-funded private firm that sought to compete with the CEC juggernaut, the Cymsnor series of light freighters saw limited success. While never coming close to rivaling the YT-series in sales, the Gymsnor series did make a small dent in the market with the Gymsnor-3. Significantly different from CEC designs, the Gymsnor-3 is a long, segmented ves­ sel with a cockpit section connected to a larger cargo hold and engine housing by a narrow neck. In the event of an emergency, the cockpit can detach from the rest of the vessel. Though adequate for shipping cargo, the Gymsnor-3 suffers from poor handling and a large defensive blind spot to the aft of the vessel. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/Gymsnor-3.

Weapons: Turret-mounted medium laser cannon (Fire Arc Forward, Port, and Starboard; Damage 6; Critical 3; Range [Close]). ADDITIONAL RULES Modular Cockpit: As an action, the pilot may discon­ nect the cockpit, abandoning the rest of the vessel. The craft’s silhouette becomes 2 and its encumbrance capac­ ity becomes 10. Anything in the back of the ship (poten­ tially including systems and attachments) is left behind. CORELLISPACE GYMSNOR-4 LIGHT FREIGHTER The Gymsnor-4 was CorelliSpace’s fourth and final model in its light freighter series. A radical redesign from previous models, the Gymsnor-4 is a flying wing with a cockpit (which, like that of its predecessor, can separate and act as an escape pod) attached to the body by a narrow neck, giving the vessel an appear­ ance resembling a mynock, something not lost on most spacers. Despite boasting several significant improve­ ments over its predecessor, the Gymsnor-4 never man­ aged to make a large impact on the light freighter mar­ ket, spelling the end for CorelliSpace’s aspirations to challenge CEC. While few Gymsnor-4 freighters can be found outside of Corellian space, the pilots and traders who operate them tend to view the ships fondly. Hull Type/Class: Freighter/Gymsnor-4.

Anything in the back of the ship (poten­ tially including systems and attachments) is left behind. Though the advent of the Clone Wars virtually doomed sales of the HWK-series of light freighters, designers at Corellian Engineering never abandoned the idea of a sleek, fast transport to match their own love for speed. Encouraged by advances in ion drive technology, CEC instituted plans to revive the HWK-series, constructing several prototypes designated the HWK-1000. While both initial performance and marketing tests delivered promising results for the HWK-290’s possible success­ sor, CEC executives scrapped the project after Imperial authorities objected to the speed and performance of the freighter, which rivaled that of some military starfighters. While the HWK-1000 never officially went into production, a clerical error resulted in several hun­ dred prototypes models rolling off the lines of CEC’s fac­ tory on Halyard 2. To recoup some of their losses, CEC surreptitiously sold the ships through various Outer Rim networks. Most of the prototype freighters ended up in the hands of collectors and smugglers.

Customization Hard Points: 5. Weapons: None. Intended to be the pinnacle of the YT-series, the YT-2000 is by any measure an impressive light freighter Retaining the distinctive saucer shape and powerful Girodyne engines of previous models, the YT-2000 features an in-line cockpit, giving the vessel a symmetrical appearance. The YT-2000 also boasts better armaments, improved maneuverability, and greater cargo capacity than its predecessors. Unfor­ tunately for Corellian Engineering, however, industrial espionage resulted in the ship’s designs leaking to its competitors, causing CEC to rush the YT-2000 into production before working out all of the avionics and component integration issues. As a consequence, the freighter is more temperamental than other YT mod­ els, causing grief for the mechanics and engineers tasked with keeping these ships in working order. Nevertheless, the YT-2000 was well-received by the public. The ship saw substantial sales prior to Corel­ lian Engineering discontinuing it in favor of the newer YT-2400, the designs of which CEC kept closely under wraps until it entered production.

Perhaps nothing in the galaxy inspires more dread in a smuggler than the sight of an Interdictor-class cruiser. Based on the Vindicator-class heavy cruiser, these large, wedge-shaped cruisers superficially resemble mighty Imperial Star Destroyers, though they perform a very specific role. By projecting a gravity shadow, known as a gravity well or interdiction field, across local space, Interdictor cruisers simulate the presence of a massive celestial body, keeping ships within the field from enter­ ing hyperspace and pulling ships in hyperspace back into realspace. Though an Imperial Naval asset, Interdictor- class cruisers frequently patrol trade routes, thwarting smugglers inclined to try outrunning Imperial authorities.

ADDITIONAL RULES Massive 1: When making an attack targeting this starship, the critical rating of any weapons used counts as 1 higher. CAPITAL S H IP S Though few smugglers operate ships larger than a light freighter or medium transport—and even fewer have access to capital warships—the wise ones mem­ orize the profiles of these large, heavily armed vessels. Even the most seasoned and audacious smugglers balk at the idea of tangling with Imperial warships and corvettes, and most would sooner dump their cargo into the vacuum of space than draw the attention of any starship bristling with weaponry and filled with merciless Imperial stormtroopers. SFS G7-X GRAVITY WELL PROJECTORS In game terms, In t e r d ic t o r -class cruisers generate a gravity bubble centered on the ship out to extreme range. Nothing within the bubble can enter hyperspace until it spends the maneuvers to travel past extreme range. As for ships being pulled from hyperspace, the actual effects are largely left to the Game Mas­ te r’s discretion. Should he so wish, and should the situation warrant, the Came Master may let the players attempt to avoid a gravity well bubble created by an In te r d ic to r , but the char­ acters should have a very good reason for it! GOLAN I SPACE DEFENSE PLATFORM A very large, heavily armed and armored space platform, the Golan I is the first in a series of plan­ etary space defense platforms built by Golan Arms. Designed to protect planets and im portant locations, the Golan I was developed during the Clone Wars to free up naval vessels for the war effort. While unable to contend with the overwhelming firepower of mod­ ern battle cruisers and Star Destroyers, the Golan I is more than a match for smaller capital vessels such as corvettes, frigates, and light cruisers, and its complement of starfighters and patrol ships can contend with starfighters and fast attack craft. Since being surpassed by the larger, and much more heavily armed, Golan II and Golan III defense platforms (dozens of which can be found in orbit around Coruscant and other important Core Worlds), the Golan I has been largely relegated to protecting less critical planets and locations of secondary impor­ tance. The Imperial Customs Service acquired many of these space platforms, as well as several of their larger cousins, to serve as systems stations, coordi­ nating operations for their ships and personnel across a wide area. Stationed in orbit around planets or along busy hyperlane routes, these stations monitor the flow of goods and traffic through their jurisdiction. Hull Type/Class: Space Defense Platform/Golan I.

Essentially an astromech installed directly into the ship’s hull, the CD-I 3z can perform astrogation calcu­ lations on its own, but it is most useful for assisting in a pilot or navigator’s own calculations. Despite their common origins, CD-13z droid brains are known to bicker with CD-1 2a autopilot droid brains when both are installed on the same vessel. Models Include: Go-Corp CD-1 3z astrogator droid brain. Base Modifiers: Droid brain can perform Astroga­ tion checks for starship with an Astrogation skill of 2 and an Intellect of 0 (if unassisted, it rolls 00 for Astrogation checks).

AX-108 "GROUND BUZZER" SURFACE- DEFENSE BLASTER CANNON Designed to provide anti-personnel defense for a star- ship when on the ground, BlasTech’s A x-108 “Ground Buzzer” is a popular modification on ships whose owners expect trouble. With a powerful blast and high rate of fire, the retractable A x-108 folds into a hidden compartment on a vessel’s hull. While the weapon can be manually operated from the cockpit, it can also be remotely activated. Models Include: BlasTech A x-108 “Ground Buzzer” surface-defense blaster cannon. Base Modifiers: See Table 2 -8 : Vehicle Weapons below; can fire automatically with a Ranged (Heavy) skill of 2 and an Agility of 0 (if unassisted, it rolls ♦ ♦ for Ranged [Heavy] checks).

INTERIOR BROADCAST SUITE As a result of their transient lifestyles, most smugglers must bring their own entertainment with them wherever they go. For many species, music is a primary form of amusement in addition to being an important cultural touchstone, and so many smugglers install systems that let them broadcast their chosen auditory entertainment across the vessel. While this can have a soothing effect if everyone aboard the ship agrees with the selection of music, it can also be a source of considerable fric­ tion between crewmates, such as if one crewmember is extremely dedicated to Gammorean opera and the rest of the crew does not share that unique taste. Models Include: Celta-corp Shipboard Music Suite, TaggeCo. Interior Broadcaster System. Base Modifiers: Increases the strain threshold of each crewmember by 1 while aboard the vessel. Modification Options: None Hard Points Required: 1. Price: 800 credits. NIGHTSHADOW COATING A special sensor-baffling coating manufactured by Arakyd Industries, nightshadow can make a ves­ sel very difficult to detect. Highly-restricted by the Empire, nightshadow coating is much sought after by smugglers who can obtain it. Models Include: Arakyd Industries Nightshadow vehicle coating. Base Modifiers: Reduces the range band of enemy ship’s passive sensors by 1 (to a minimum of close range) for detecting a vessel with nightshadow coating. Modification Options: 1 Reduce the ship’s silhou­ ette by 1 in combat Mod. Hard Points Required: 1. Price: (R) 3,500 credits. ONBOARD AMENITIES UNIT A smuggler’s vessel is usually his home, and thus tends to be stocked with familiar comforts. For some, this means keeping a refrigeration unit full of some favor­ ite food, while for others it can mean well-furnished compartment full of libations, alcoholic or otherwise. Whatever the specifics, a ship with an onboard ame­ nities unit allows its inhabitants to offer hospitality to any guests aboard their vessel. Models Include: Gosiea Industries RefresherPlus, TaggeCo. Chill-compartment. Base Modifiers: Upgrades the ability of Charm, Deception, and Negotiation checks made by crew­ members while aboard the vessel once. Modification Options: None. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: 750 credits. RAPID CARGO EVACUATION CHUTE Though no corporation officially acknowledges mak­ ing a product with this functionality, many smugglers nonetheless rig their cargo bays to be able to rapidly dump their payloads (regardless of whether or not the vehicle is in motion, ideally). Though no smuggler ever wants to use this feature, dumping one’s cargo can mean the difference between jail time and slipping past the authorities to smuggle another day. Models Include: Custom models. Base Modifiers: Allows the smuggler to make an Average Mechanics check as an action while in the cockpit or cargo bay to eject everything cur­ rently stored in the cargo hold. Modification Options: 1 this attachment may instead be activated as an action without making a check Mod. Hard Points Required: 1 Price: (R) 500 credits.

Although this is obviously true for a party that includes a Smuggler character, any group with its own starship and the need to pay off an Obligation might find itself taking on work moving contraband. At the basic level, smuggling adventures involve taking something from point A to point B. This is usually illicit cargo, but it might include passengers who need to get somewhere quickly and discreetly. Some adventures may center around obtaining the cargo before transporting it with relative ease. This is especially true for Thieves and Charmers, whose skills lend themselves to relieving others of their possessions. However, transporting contraband across the galaxy is easier said than done. Smug­ glers must contend with deadly rivals, treacherous patrons, and cutthroat employers, to say nothing of unflinching stormtroopers and customs officers, all while navigating dangerous hyperroutes, engaging in shoot-outs, and negotiating for their own cut of the profits. Conditions are harsh, and risks abound. Chapter III: It’s Just Business gives players and GMs new rules and guidance for hyperspace travel, con jobs and heists, quick-draw blaster duels, and other im portant features of smuggling adventures. Although prim arily intended for Smugglers, charac­ ters of all types can use these rules. .“You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren’t enough scoundrels in your life." -Han Solo JOB OPPORTUNITIES ABOUND P layer Characters in E dge o f t h e E m p ir e might take on smuggling work for many reasons. While Smug­ glers are particularly likely to undertake such jobs, any characters with their own ship might look to smuggling as an avenue to earn some extra credits, or even reduce their Obligation. With three new special­ izations introduced in this book, E d g e o f t h e E m p ir e offers a total of six specializations for the Smuggler career, along with numerous options for skills and tal­ ents to create unique, exciting characters. Telling Smuggler Stories includes guidance for players selecting a specialization that suits their play style and for GMs crafting adventures that cater to their players’ expectations. In addition to looking at the various skills and abilities of Smugglers and how they can contribute during adventures that do not directly involve smuggling, this section also looks at how non-Smuggler characters can make the most of their abilities during smuggling adventures. Running Smuggling Jobs offers concrete resources to help the GM tailor sessions and even whole cam­ paigns to Smuggler characters. It gives GMs solid tools to assist with telling such stories, such as rules for determining cargo payouts and expanded options for occupational hazards of smuggling. Expanded rules for Hyperspace Travel help GMs determine if the PCs beat a rival to a potential buyer or end up stranded in deep space. PCs wishing to conceal their identities—or implicate others—might try recon­ figuring their ship’s transponder code. Guidance and rules for running Con Jobs and Scams and Heists and Break-Ins give GMs tools to create challenges suited to Scoundrels, Thieves, and Charmers. This section helps these charlatans use their skills to line their pockets at others’ expense, and guide GMs in adjudicating such endeavors. Gunslingers and other fighters can prove their skill in quick-draw Showdowns and Shoot-Outs Gam blers and other characters can raise the stakes and try their hand at Gambling and Games of Chance, which includes rules for hintaro, a popular game of chance that has made and destroyed fortunes the galaxy over. Smuggling Nemeses and Smuggling Rings arm the GM with underworld archetypes and institutions to challenge the PCs and be memorable recurring enemies—or even allies—in any Star Wars story. Finally, The Big Payoff helps GMs handle the results of successful smuggling runs. PCs who succeed might receive exorbitant wealth, reputations as skilled trans­ porters, or even greater rewards... TELLING SMUGGLER STORIES H ow does a Game Master know what sort of adven­ true his players would enjoy? The best way is, of course, to ask them, but he can also look to the way in which they have created their characters for inspiration. Because the Smuggler career covers such a wide range of character types, as represented by the Charmer, Gambler, Gunslinger, Thief, Scoundrel, and Pilot specializations, players provide the GM with clues about their play preferences simply in the act of choosing a specialization. Correspondingly, GMs have a number of options and considerations when designing and running adventures for Smugglers. This choice even has an impact on the party dynamics, as certain careers and specializations are predisposed to collaboration or conflict with Smugglers. CRAFTING A D V E N T U R E S FOR S M U G G L E R S The galaxy overflows with less-than-legal jobs if one only knows where to look and who to talk to. However, smuggling is difficult and dangerous work, and to make ends meet, the PCs might find themselves work­ ing for massive criminal organizations or pan-galactic cartels such as the Hutt kajidics or the Tenloss Syn­ dicate. Of course, numerous other smuggling rings of every size and description provide further possibilities for lucrative work. W H O B E C O M E S A SM U G G L E R ? Choosing a career is an important decision for a player when creating a new PC. In addition to defining a character’s abilities, a choice of career helps deter­ mine how the other residents of the galaxy might view the PC. Most importantly from the perspective of a Game Master, the choice of career shows what a player hopes to do with his character. This informa­ tion should help the CM plan adventures and encoun­ ters for his campaign With such a range of character types falling under the Smuggler umbrella, it is difficult to generalize about what attracts players to this career. Although most Smugglers share certain characteristics—a free spirit, disregard for authority, and the willingness to make their living flouting the law—it is best to look at the particular specialization a player selects. PILOT Pilots are integral to groups that travel a lot, particu­ larly between planets, but also for those that use the landspeeders and airspeeders found throughout the galaxy. Being a Pilot is not just about getting from place to place, though, but about getting there in style. A player who selects the Pilot specialization craves speed, whether it comes from swoop races, high-speed landspeeder chases, or, if he ta‘kes the Gunnery skill, deep-space dogfights. Pilots excel at getting the party both into and out of trouble. From providing a getaway to extracting the PCs out of a dangerous situation to backing up negotiations with a ship-mounted laser cannon, count on a good Pilot to bail the others out when things look bad. Choosing this specialization suggests a desire for high-adrena­ line action scenes. Although the preference is prob­ ably for vehicular action, anything that keeps the PCs moving is a good bet. SCOUNDREL A Scoundrel is the consummate outlaw—charming, stylish, and confident—with the skills to back it up. Players who choose the Scoundrel specialization are usually looking for trouble. This doesn’t mean the player wants to disrupt the game, but he’s eager to introduce additional conflict in ways that keep every­ one entertained. The player of a Scoundrel likely wants to defy authority, perhaps openly, perhaps dis­ creetly. That authority might be planetary authorities, crime bosses, or even the Empire. Playing a Scoundrel allows a player to instigate trouble and conflict, pos­ sibly to the other PCs’ chagrin, and resolve it with a cool demeanor and sense of style. GMs should find ways to indulge players of Scoun­ drels without the other PCs (or players) perceiving the Scoundrel’s knack for trouble as nothing but a liabil­ ity. One way is by offering the group a choice between doing something the legitimate, “respectable” way or doing it the Scoundrel’s way, while highlighting the disadvantages of the respectable way. In such situ­ ations, the “easy” way might be more dangerous, at least if things go wrong, but the respectable way has some other unavoidable cost. Another way is to dem­ onstrate to the group that when the Scoundrel gets them into trouble, it creates narrative opportunities that can pay out in the long run—even if he gets the party into hot water right now. Thieves are usually the subtlest of all Smugglers. A player might choose the Thief specialization because he wants to go places no other character can: slipping past sentries, bypassing security systems, and scaling sheer surfaces. Sometimes, both shooting and talk­ ing their way through a challenge are poor options for the PCs. In these cases, a Thief can sneak by, cause a distraction, or otherwise circumvent the challenge. Thieves wield their wits to overcome obstacles with­ out violence or direct confrontation. Because Thieves are often uniquely suited for such challenges, this spe­ cialization appeals to some players who want to play an indispensable part in the group’s success while not necessarily taking center stage during combat or tense negotiations. GMs can cater to Thief PCs with puzzles involv­ ing technological or mechanical security systems. Although their problem-solving abilities aren’t as flashy as a Gunslinger’s blaster-work or a Gambler’s risk-taking, Thieves bring unique abilities to overcome obstacles in ways other characters simply cannot. CHARMER A player who chooses the Charmer specialization for his character generally wants roleplaying opportuni­ ties for talkative social interaction, anything from wheedling information out of a cantina owner to convincing bounty hunters to holster their weapons. Although some blaster shoot-outs are to be expected in any Star Wars campaign, the Charmer might seek to resolve matters without violence whenever pos­ sible. This might be due to noble sentiments or simply a matter of practicality—combat is dangerous, and why risk his neck if it’s not necessary? A player who creates a Charmer character might genuinely not find combat enjoyable, or he might just want to try a dif­ ferent kind of character. The GM should talk with the player about his preferences and keep them in mind when designing encounters. The player, however, should realize that avoiding combat is not just up to the CM; he needs to take full advantage of his skills and talents as a Charmer. One way the CM might tailor the game to the Charmer is by giving additional thought to the motiva­ tions and secrets of the major NPCs. This does not mean every minion or background character, but just like the GM considers the strengths and weaknesses of combat-oriented NPCs when designing important encounters, he can consider the relative strengths and weaknesses of social and political rivals as well. THIEF Smuggling is a dangerous game, but of all the Smug­ gler specializations, the Gambler is the biggest risk- taker. Gamblers love thrills, not always in sense of physical danger—although no stakes are higher than life-and-death—but in finding high-stakes wagers anywhere they can. This could range from betting on themselves to shoot before that bounty hunter or betting that their modifications to the ship’s engines can give them a vital boost of speed without blowing the whole ship apart. The unique talents available to Gamblers mean that taking risks pays off in a way that it does not for other character types. GMs can indulge players of Gamblers by providing dangerous challenges and difficult obstacles that can only be overcome with an “all-in" approach. This gives a player who seeks such high-stakes action a tangible game incentive to roll the dice. GUNSLINGER Where others fight to win, a Gunslinger fights to win with supreme style. Gunslingers are ideal for players who crave a stylish signature combat style. A Gun­ slinger’s confidence and skill show in his usual choice of blaster pistols, often in pairs, over larger weapons. The Gunslinger specialization is the obvious choice for a player who wants their Smuggler character to really hold his own in combat. With their penchant for standoffs and showdowns (see page 85), Gunsling­ ers take center stage with their ability with a blaster. Any player who selects this specialization clearly hopes for a chance to show off in gunfights, and GMs should feel free to indulge that interest. In order to really display his abilities, a character must, of course, test his skill against worthy opponents, and GMs should pay attention to the details when creating NPCs to serve as foils for a Gunslinger. This includes the mechanical details of the NPCs characteristics and skills, but also the enemy’s personality and moti­ vations. It is all the more satisfying for a player when his character puts a cocky, obnoxious, or flat-out evil opponent in his place! Although violence is not usu­ ally the best answer, the Outer Rim and the seedy spaceports where Smugglers spend their time often see scores settled with fast-draw duels. GAMBLERS M U G G L E R S IN ED G E OF TH E E M P IR E Smugglers bring valuable skills and talents to any group, whether that group actually takes on smug­ gling as a primary occupation or not. As anyone who spends time with Smugglers can say, no two are alike. In E dge o f the E m p ir e , six specializations offer a wealth of different abilities and play options for Smugglers. PILOT Every E d ce o f the E m p ir e party needs a starship, and that means they need someone to fly it. While other characters might be able to handle the basics, only a dedicated Pilot can bring out the most in a starship, whether that means pushing a factory-standard model to its limits or keeping a heavily customized and tem­ peramental bird flying. Although indispensable for out­ running Imperial patrols during smuggling jobs, Pilots pull their weight any time the party needs to get some­ where fast. Although speed is almost always useful, it can mean the difference between life and death for the PCs when a plan goes less than smoothly. SCOUNDREL Scoundrels are true jacks-of-all-trades, equally value­ able in a blaster fight, a business negotiation, or at the sabacc table. Because Scoundrels tend to be well- rounded, there are few situations to which they can’t contribute. In many cases, a Scoundrel might act in a supporting role for another PC who is more special­ ized in the skills needed for the task at hand. Just as often, however, the Scoundrel can step up when the party lacks a specialist for a given situation. Even in those situations where a Scoundrel’s experi­ ence is not relevant, he might try to bluff his way through, regardless—and it just might work. THIEF Although a Thief’s abilities have obvious use as a prelude to proper smuggling—merchandise is always more profitable without an up-front cost—there are innumerable situations in which he can contribute to the party’s success. When the PCs find themselves on the wrong side of the law or their for­ mer business associates, the Thief can ensure they escape from that Hutt’s dun­ geon or Sector Ranger’s brig. A Thief can also make all the difference when the party needs to access information that is off-limits, whether by eavesdropping on a private conversation, accessing restricted computer data, or abscond­ ing with confidential records. CHARMER Whether arranging Smuggling deals or any other less-than-legal business, a Charmer is invaluable to ensure negotiations go well and the PCs come out on top. And when things do go south, a skilled Charmer can often smooth things out without resorting to vio­ lence. After all, even a party fully prepared for deadly combat occasionally prefers to avoid it. And while Pilots handle the flying, Traders handle the finances, and Scoundrels make the right connections, a good Charmer can make all the difference in a smuggling job’s success should the worst happen and the PCs find their ship boarded by local customs officers or agents of the Imperial Space Ministry. GAMBLER Like Scoundrels, Gamblers are versatile characters who can aid the party in many different situations. Gamblers achieve this through cunning, trickery, and an almost supernatural level of luck. A true Gambler realizes few individuals can resist a good wager and betting is a potential solution to nearly any situation, including matters of life and death. Others might think this hubris, foolishness, or a lack of appreciation for the seriousness of a situation—and they could very well be right—but making a game of it is what gives a Gambler the best shot at succeeding. And after all, what are skill, training, experience, and preparation except ways to stack the odds in one’s favor? Gunslingers have a chance to shine in any adventure that involves combat, or the threat of it, whether or not smuggling is a strong feature of the session. Gun­ slingers focus on expertise and speed and, unlike Hired Guns, tend to favor pistols over blaster rifles, carbines, and heavier weapons. Few locations in the Outer Rim completely forbid personal weapons. This means Gunslingers can operate at peak efficiency in situations where other characters might be at a dis­ advantage because they do not have access to their preferred armaments. Gunslingers keep a cool head in tense situations. Their steely nerves, combined with their confidence and bravado, means that Gunslingers are assets in negotiations, standoffs, and similar situ­ ations all too common on the fringes of the Empire. N O N -SM U G G LERS IN SM U G G LIN G A D V EN T U R ES Obviously, Smugglers have a prime role in any adven­ true based around smuggling, and Smugglers are likely to instigate such adventures whenever possible. What is not so clear is how the other PCs will get their moments in the spotlight in such underhanded adven­ tures. While it is common, and more than fine, for an adventure to strongly feature a particular PC (so long as the GM rotates and gives each party member an adventure playing to his strengths), the GM should take efforts to ensure that all PCs receive an opportu­ nity to use their skills and abilities so that no player feels left out of the action. GMs can involve other PCs in smuggling adventures any number of ways, and it would be impossible to cover all the possibilities. However, characters with a given career do share access to certain skills and tal­ ents that can be very useful during a smuggling job. BOUNTY HUNTER Although Bounty Hunters and Smugglers might seem like natural enemies, their skills complement each other quite well. It is the very fact that Bounty Hunt­ ers must often track Smugglers that provides them with the knowledge of the criminal underworld, and smuggling in particular, to aid in such endeavors. Fur­ ther, Bounty Hunters can frequently offer insight into potential rival Smugglers, and they might even remove them from the picture while collecting a bounty. The mere presence of a Bounty Hunter can also benefit a smuggling operation. Although authorities rarely think highly of Bounty Hunters, they nonethe­ less might ignore parties including a Bounty Hunter, assuming that such a character would not assist in smuggling operations. GUNSLINGER While Colonists might not feel comfortable with smug­ gling (at least at first), they nonetheless have a lot to offer in this line of work. Politicos can be invaluable for smoothing things over with rivals and the authorities, avoiding violence or jail time. Scholars can provide useful information about the value of unusual goods or where to find them. As always, a Doctor’s talents are invaluable when a shoot-out goes south or the ille­ gal animals the party is smuggling start biting. EXPLORER Explorers’ well-rounded abilities put them in an excel­ lent position to help with smuggling operations. Fring- ers’ abilities often overlap with those of Smugglers, and they can assist with flying, plotting hyperspace routes, and negotiating with potential employers. Particularly when operating together in a party, it can be a good idea for a Fringer and Smuggler to work on developing their skills in different, complemen­ tary areas. Smuggling in the Outer Rim often means navigating treacherous environments to meet with local crime lords, recover dead drops, and even to hide from pursuit, and a Scout is perfectly suited to guide the party through such encounters. Unsurpris­ ingly, Traders are perfect companions for Smugglers, particularly those risk-taking types who lack decorum and business acumen. After all, what is smuggling but a type of high-risk trading? HIRED GUN Although an ideal smuggling job should not include any fights, things rarely go according to plan with such illicit activities. In addition to guarding precious cargo from pirates and raiders, the mere presence of an intimidating Hired Gun might scare off the com­ petition. In the rough space ports of the Outer Rim, even police forces are often loathe to hassle heavily armed bruisers and mercenaries. Also, an intimidating fighter can always prove a great asset during negotia­ tions, resulting in a smooth transaction even when an employer or buyer might have planned betrayal. TECHNICIAN Technicians are invaluable to an effective smuggling operation. A Smuggler can’t smuggle without a ship, and a skilled Mechanic ensures that his baby keeps flying. Everyone knows the most successful Smugglers rely on modifications to their ships, and an Outlaw Tech in the group saves credits and ensures that the ship is fast—and well-armed—enough for the job. And for the smuggling group that needs to clear arrest records or renew a ship registration without submit­ ting to a Bureau of Ships and Services inspection, a Slicer can provide the solution. COLONISTSM U G G L E R S IN TH E P A R T Y As such an iconic part of the Star Wars galaxy, Smug­ glers feature in almost any E dge o f t h e E m p ir e cam­ paign (as a part of the party, or amongst the NPCs with whom the group interacts). Smugglers bring many useful skills and abilities to a party, but just as impor­ tant are the considerations for how a Smuggler fits into the dynamics of a party. The attitudes, abilities, and actions of Smugglers, and how the other charac­ ters react, can provide a trove of great roleplaying. Although each Player Character is unique, careers tend to feature certain common traits that allow some generalizations about how PCs of each career interact with one another. After all, careers represent broad archetypes that are easily identifiable for the role they play in the Star Wars galaxy. SMUGGLERS AND BOUNTY HUNTERS Although their skills and talents often complement each other’s, Bounty Hunters and Smugglers are likely, perhaps more than any other careers, to come into conflict. This comes as no surprise to anyone famil­ iar with Han Solo’s travails with bounty hunters from Greedo to Boba Fett. Such conflicts can arise when an enemy places a high-priced bounty on the head of a Smuggler PC. While Smugglers and Bounty Hunters working together in a party might form a strong bond, the promise of a rich reward can truly test the strength of this relationship. Unless all the players are com­ fortable with such intra-party conflict, the GM should take steps to ensure events do not lead to the Bounty Hunter turning on the Smuggler—although a bit of tension might not be a bad thing and can make for great roleplaying. In addition, particularly daring par­ ties might concoct a plan to claim the bounty on the Smuggler, only to break him out of holding later on. SMUGGLERS AND COLONISTS For some Colonists, the life of a Smuggler can be shocking. A bookish Scholar or rule-bound Politico might disapprove of a Smuggler’s careless risk-taking and flagrant disregard for the law. However, Colonists growing up on the Outer Rim might understand the reasons for operating outside the law, having seen communities starve due to Imperial blockades or suf­ fer under the fist of corrupt governments. Politicos in particular tend to possess skills that can greatly aid a Smuggler. This might lead to a mutual friendship or a grudging admiration, depending on the personalities and philosophies of the two. SMUGGLERS AND EXPLORERS Smugglers and Explorers often find they have a great deal in common. Individuals who enter both these careers tend to display a free spirit, wanderlust, and some degree of distaste for civilized society. However, whereas Explorers constantly seek the unknown, Smugglers find their forte moving from world to world (preferably as captain of their own ship) and operating outside of society’s laws. In particular, Explorers of the Trader specialization are likely to find common ground with Smugglers. A respected Trader can add an air of legitimacy to keep a smuggling operation from closer scrutiny by the authorities. In some partnerships, a Trader might act as chief negotiator in business transactions, leaving the flying, logistics, and dirty work for the Smuggler. On the other hand, a Trader who prides himself on ethical and legal business practices might take con­ siderable offense at the actions of a Smuggler. SMUGGLERS AND HIRED GUNS Gunslingers and Hired Guns both tend to pride them­ selves on their skill with a blaster (or other chosen weapon). As they get into scrapes together, fighting side-by-side, this might develop into a friendly rivalry, with each striving to outdo the other with trick shots, or even “ keeping score.” However, Smugglers who pre­ fer to avoid violence might take issue with particularly bloodthirsty Hired Guns. Such contentious issues can create tension in the party, particularly if a trigger- happy character accidentally damages the cargo! SMUGGLERS AND TECHNICIANS Perhaps no two careers go together like Smugglers and Technicians, who often become fast friends. Smug­ glers almost invariably share a deep affection for their ship, an affection that only a Technician understands. In-between discovering (or causing) a starship’s quirks as they tinker, repair, and modify, a Smuggler and Technician might quickly amass a private language of in-jokes and references. As they work together in smuggling operations, always relying on their beloved ship to pull them through, this bond will likely deepen. RUNNING SMUGGLING JOBS n ot just anyone can become a Smuggler. Smuggling is difficult and dangerous work, and Smugglers often find themselves caught between law enforce­ meant officials and crime bosses. It takes uniquely talented, cool-headed individuals to pull off this dan­ gerous work and make enough credits for it to be worthwhile. Many Smugglers consider it a success to simply earn enough to keep their ships flying with­ out increasing their existing debts. Others have higher expectations, from that new hyperdrive they have their eyes on to founding their own criminal empires. T H E B U S IN E S S OF S M U G G L IN G To do his job, a Smuggler needs two things: a ship and a cargo. Presumably, a Smuggler character already has a ship, either one of his own or one he shares with the other PCs. That leaves the cargo. FINDING WORK Experienced Smugglers develop numerous contacts in the criminal underworld who can either set them up with cargo directly or point them in the direction of someone who needs their services. Profitable cargo can also come from unexpected places, and finding it is a good opportunity to involve PCs other than the Smuggler in the business of smuggling, either using their skills to make contacts, acquiring goods on their own, or tying it into their backstories. In some cases, a PC might take on a dangerous cargo in order to pay down an Obligation. TRAMP FREIGHTERS A tramp freighter is a cargo vessel with no standard port-of-call or shipping route. For obvious reasons, most smuggling vessels operate officially as tram p freighters. This allows them to move freely from port to port and planet to planet while holding on to a cover of legitimacy. However, a set schedule and route can sometimes be advantageous for smuggling, as such ships tend to attract less attention from port authorities, who see them regularly and come to trust them as reli­ able, trouble-free vessels. Often, Smugglers who come to captain tram p freighters begin their careers as legitimate freight liners with regular routes, later taking on “additional” cargo due to pressure from criminal elements, a dire need for credits, or simple greed. The most commonly smuggled cargo is, unsurpris­ ingly, illegal goods, with gun running and spice smug­ gling being particularly lucrative lines of work. Any of the black market items beginning on page 1 83 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook could become potential cargo. However, Smugglers also frequently transport legal goods for criminal organizations or even legitimate corporations in order to avoid taxes and tariffs, resulting in a higher profit margin for their employer. Other, nobler reasons for smuggling might include getting medical supplies to a planet under strict Imperial quarantine, rescuing slaves, or transport­ ing information or operatives for the Rebel Alliance. GETTING PAID Table 3 -1 : Cargo Payout shows what the PCs can expect to receive as payment for a smuggling mission. The CM should find the rarity and total value of the good listed in Chapter V: Gear and Equipment of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook (or the supple­ meant in which the item appears). Once the CM knows this total value, he can calculate the percentage the PCs will earn for delivering it based on Table 3 -1 : Cargo Payout. The CM should modify the rarity of the cargo depending on the destination if applicable (see page 1 50 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rule­ book). If the cargo is illegal on the destination world, the GM should use the value listed under Restricted; otherwise, he should use the Unrestricted value. Successful (or abysmal) negotiations with their potential employer and other circumstances can fur­ ther modify the PCs’ profits. After the GM determines what the PCs will be offered for the job by default, he should consult on Table 3 -2 : Payout Modifiers to determine what percentage of this base value the PCs gain (or lose) at the negotiating table and due to their performance during the trip. The GM should treat these as a starting point, and use them in addition to any other factors he deems relevant or interesting. Once it comes time for the PCs to be paid (usually, upon delivery of the cargo), the CM should sum all of the modifiers to the base cost from Table 3 -2 : Pay­ out Modifiers (and any other modifiers) to find the final modifier. Then, he should have the PCs receive their pay, with the bonus (or penalty, if the final modi­ fier is negative) that the final modifier dictates. Goods with a rarity of 3 or less are rarely worth smuggling, unless the origin point or destination has particularly high tariffs for the cargo in question, or other unusual and localized circumstances increase its value or decrease its availability. In such cases, the GM should adjust the cargo’s effective rarity accordingly. TABLE 3-1: CARGO PAYOUT TABLE 3-2: PAYOUT MODIFIERS Rarity Restricted Unrestricted 4 - 5 10% 5% 6 - 7 25% 10% 8 - 9 30% 25% 10 50% 30% Circumstance Modifier Each O o n Negotiation check (or other skill at GM’s discretion) + 10% Each & on Negotiation check (or other skill at GM's discretion) + 5% Each ^ or <§} <§> <§> on Negotiation check (or other skill at GM’s discretion) -1 0 % Each T on Negotiation check (or other skill at GM's discretion) -5 % The destination is under Imperial blockade + 20% The destination is under criminal or other blockade + 10% The PCs arrive earlier than contracted + 10% per day early The Pcs arrive later than contracted -1 0 % per day late The PCs lose a portion of the cargo -1 0 % or more (based on losses) Unless the character rectifies the situation quickly (and sometimes even then), he can expect unpleasant consequences. The GM should take into consideration the value of the goods, the personality of the individual who hired the Smuggler, and previous business inter­ actions between the two when deciding on the con­ sequences. Most importantly, he should treat this not as a “punishment" but as an opportunity to advance the story with added complications and trouble. Con­ sequences might include increased Obligation, having their patron take out a bounty on the Smuggler’s head, or anything else the CM deems appropriate. A crew might fail to deliver their cargo for any number of reasons, from interception by pirates to jettisoning the cargo in the face of an Imperial patrol. Unfortu­ nately, the sorts of criminal bosses and organiza­ tions that hire Smugglers tend to see all such reasons as excuses, and they tend not to like excuses. In most cases, the employer holds the Smuggler personally responsible for the value of the lost cargo. O CCUPATIONAL H A Z A R D S No one ever said smuggling is easy money—and if they did, they lied. Smugglers run into all sorts of dangers, obstacles, and setbacks in their line of work. Even runs that seem simple at the outset often become complicated in a hurry. A good Smuggler has to be able to adjust his plans on the fly and deal with the unexpected. Perhaps even more than rival Smug­ glers, pirates, and bounty hunters, the greatest and most persistent obstacles facing many Smugglers are the labyrinthine rules and regulations of the bureau­ cracies that oversee space travel and galactic trade. THE IMPERIAL CUSTOMS OFFICE The Imperial Customs Office constitutes one of the largest threats to any Smuggler, yet it is also the reason smuggling can be such a lucrative career. The Imperial Customs Office is the agency of the Empire responsible for enforcing rules and regula­ tions regarding interstellar trade, including ensuring that tariffs are collected and interdicting illegal cargo. Although the Imperial Navy often undertakes anti­ smuggling duties, the galaxy is a vast place. The Navy doesn’t have the resources to patrol every hyperlane and spaceport, especially on the Outer Rim. The Cus­ toms Office maintains its own fleet of corvettes and other light patrol vessels for such activities. Although these ships lack the sheer intimidation factor of Star Destroyers, they can still outgun and overpower most freighter-flying Smugglers, pirates, and even Rebels. Most systems with an Imperial Customs presence have at least one Customs ship permanently sta­ tioned, while major systems and trading hubs might serve as base to a flotilla. Any star system that sees regular legal trade or is infamous for smuggling hosts a Customs office or presence of some kind. Depend­ ing on the system in question, Imperial Customs might have a small office in a major spaceport, its own dedi­ cated space station, or both. Imperial law authorizes customs patrols to stop and board any starship, regardless of probable cause or suspicion of illegal activity. Boarding parties, which might include stormtroopers, particularly in areas of high smuggling activity, ensure that ships comply with Imperial law regarding transponder codes, certifica­ tion and registration (including a Bureau of Ships and Services datapad), ship modifications, safety regula­ tions, cargo, and passengers and crew. Each of these areas encompasses a huge and ever-changing variety of rules, and even a captain who does his utmost to operate legally is likely to find himself in violation of one obscure regulation or another. Customs is primarily an enforcement agency, and it maintains the authority to confiscate cargo, arrest crew and passengers, and even impound ships. Addi­ tionally, Customs ships do not hesitate to fire upon suspected smuggling vessels that fail to comply. While Customs agents verify the registration and credentials of ships and captains during any check, it is BoSS that actually maintains these records. THE BUREAU OF SHIPS AND SERVICES (BOSS) While the Imperial Space Ministry certifies and inspects space stations and ports, the Bureau of Ships and Services, commonly known as BoSS, is the extra- governmental bureaucracy that certifies captains and maintains records of ships, including modifications, weapons and shields, and transponder codes (see page 384 of the E dge o f t h e E m p ir e Core Rulebook). Despite BoSS’s size, the number of ships operating in the galaxy is so vast that it is impossible for BoSS to maintain accurate records without the cooperation of captains. Captains who make modifications them­ selves or with the aid of outlaw technicians might keep their ship running for years without a proper BoSS inspection, but sooner or later, they have to get their ship registration and captain’s certification updated. This either means submitting to proper inspection or falsifying records—and for Smugglers with illegally modified ships and dozens of infractions under their belts, there is really only one option. Falsifying records usually means hiring an extremely skilled slicerto breach the BoSS data net. Although far from unheard of in its 1 8,000-year history, the famil­ ial structure of BoSS ensures that corruption among its ranks is much lower than in other organizations. A BoSS bureaucrat might accept a bribe, if a captain is extremely lucky, but it won’t come cheap. BOSS DATAPADS All ships have a BoSS datapad that includes relevant information about the ship and its captain. When boarded by Imperial forces, customs officers, or any other officials or law enforcement, a captain is expected to provide his BoSS datapad. These officials have direct access to BoSS records as well. If the info­ mation in a captain’s BoSS datapad does not match BoSS’s records, he is in big trouble. For this reason, a Smuggler or other captain who wishes to falsify records must go to the source, but slicing into BoSS’s data net is much easier said than done. Elowever, par­ ticularly if the agency performing the inquiry has not paid the premium cost for BoSS’s regular updates, a charming Smuggler might convince officials that the datapad truly does reflect the latest information. BoSS datapads feature a standard read-only port and a unique write port. Without a BoSS data plug (which would usually need to be obtained via illegal means), slicing a BoSS datapad requires a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Computers check On a failed check, ^ fries the pad, leaving it permanently inoperable. If successful, ^ means the character leaves evidence of his tampering. This upgrades the difficulty of future skill checks to authenticate the data. Altering BoSS’s data net is another matter, and could form the basis of an adventure in itself, with the PCs either breaking into a secure BoSS facility or bluffing their way inside (see Con Jobs and Scams on page 79 or Heists and Break-Ins on page 82). TRANSPONDER CODES BoSS assigns and records the transponder codes of all starships before they leave the factory floor. Tran­ sponder codes identify a ship to other ships’ sen­ sors, stating the ship’s name, type, captain, and other information. Although the transponder signal itself includes basic information, further authentication is possible by referencing the transponder code against BoSS records. Normally, only Imperial forces and law enforcement keep updated BoSS records, due to the costs involved, and system or planetary authorities might not even do so. Especially on backwater worlds, such advanced and expensive resources are simply not available to local authorities most of the time. Transponders are built into a ship’s sublight engines, and they continually broadcast when the engines are running. Tampering with a transponder not only risks damaging the engines themselves, it’s highly illegal. To further safeguard against falsification of transpon­ der codes, each includes two parts—a data signal (this is usually what a spacer means when referring to a transponder code) and an underlying energy signature that comes directly from the activity of the ship’s engine. Each such energy signature is unique, but ships with comparable engines, such as ships of the same model, have very similar “fingerprints.” This means that one YT-1500 light freighter has a good chance to “disguise” itself as a different YT-1 300 by modifying the data signal, while being somewhat less likely to pass itself off as a YT-2400. ADDING TRANSPONDER CODES A talented sheer can, although not easily, add alter­ nate transponder codes to a ship or replace its tran­ sponder code entirely. Doing so might fool most civil­ ian vessels, but a ship or spaceport with access to BoSS records can see right through such a deception. In these cases, the character’s best bet is to create a false transponder code that matches an existing BoSS record for a ship with a near-identical engine profile. When selecting a suitable ship to mimic, the PCs should first access BoSS records. Although they could take a guess and identify themselves as a different ship of the same model, most likely only a few ships in the galaxy have a similar enough transponder profile to make a convincing ruse. The latest non-classified transponder data is available from BoSS for a fee of 1,000 credits, although buyers must first pass a background check and update their own ship registra­ tion. Finding an approximate match requires an Aver­ age Computers check and several hours. Of course, if the actual ship the PCs are masquerading as is active in the region, this could quickly expose their ruse. For this reason, many Smugglers fabricate an identity and have a slicer add it to the BoSS data net, or they take the identity of a ship they know to be destroyed but never reported as lost. Caining physical access to the transponder system requires a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Mechanics check. To add or replace a transponder code “identity," a charac­ ter must make a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Computers check A ship can store numerous different transpon­ der codes, but the fact that only a few ships in the gal­ axy have convincingly similar engine signatures limits the effectiveness of multiple identities. It is possible to modify the ship’s engine to mimic the energy output of other vessels, but this is difficult and dangerous, as the modifications cause the engines to “run hot” and might inflict permanent damage. The difficulty of the Mechanics check depends on how different the ships are; mimicking another vessel of the same class is Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) . while copying the pattern of a much larger ship is Formidable and the GM might also upgrade the difficulty. Reverting to the ship’s original profile is Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) At the GM’s discretion, <§) generated on these checks might cause system strain, while ^ could permanently damage the engines—roll on Table 7 -9 : Critical Hit Results on page 244 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook. Concealing a ship’s transponder code is easier than faking one, requiring an Average Computers or Mechanics check. However, masking a transpon­ der code is just as illegal as falsifying one, and much more obvious, immediately attracting the attention of any authorities (or bounty hunters) in sensor range. Some Smugglers choose to do so regardless, usually when doing something obviously illegal and bound to attract attention, simply so they cannot be identified as the culprit afterward—assuming they get away! HYPERSPACE TRAVEL Table 3 -3 : Expanded Astrogation Modifiers lists additional examples for reasons GMs should modify a character’s dice pool when attempting an Astrogation check. With the complexity and danger of hyperspace travel, any number of calamities can befall a starship, but a skilled astrogator, an advanced navicomputer, or sheer luck can also result in great boons. When determining the outcome of a hyper­ space journey, GMs and players can spend dice sym­ bols for positive and negative effects as shown on Table 3 -4 : Spending O , (&» <§>, and ^ During Astrogation Checks. TABLE 3-4: SPENDING Q , & ® , AND ^ DURING ASTROGATION CHEEKS Cost Result Options o The character adds □ to his next Astrogation check when travelling on this route. o o The trip is particularly smooth. Each character aboard the vessel recovers 2 strain. The ship reaches its destination 25% faster. (This option can only be selected once per check). The discovery of a new shortcut grants □ on all future Astrogation checks to use this hyperspace route. Additionally, many organizations and individuals would be willing to pay for such a shortcut, especially if it is on a busy hyperlane. @ An energy surge from the hyperdrive inflicts one system strain on the ship. The character adds ■ to his next Astrogation check when travelling on this route. {§> © The trip is particularly rough. Each character aboard the vessel suffers 2 strain.

(This option can only be selected once per check). The hyperdrive cuts out to avoid a gravity shadow, but it is damaged in the process. Once the vessel exits hyperspace, the hyperdrive is rendered inoperable until repaired The ship collides with a planet’s gravity shadow or similar phenomenon. This forces the ship out of hyperspace (probably at a very inconvenient location). Further, the ship im m ediately suffers a single Critical Hit with a + 3 0 to the result on Table 7 - 9 : Critical H it Result (see page 2 4 4 of the E d g e o f t h e E m p i r e Core Rulebook).

Aside from the fact that receiving parties and buyers might impose a deadline, the longer a job drags on, the higher a Smuggler’s chances of being caught. Getting the job done promptly can also impress employers and increase the chances of future work and better pay. Although numerous factors contribute to the timeframe of a job, a skilled captain and a fast hyper­ drive are the most important. If the crew know of any hyperlane shortcuts or possess the skill to handle dangerous—but faster—runs, so much the better. TH E A R T OF A ST R O G A T IO N Plotting a course through hyperspace requires a suc­ cessful Astrogation check as described on page 246 of the E dge o f t h e E m p ir e Core Rulebook. Although a ship’s navicomputer usually handles the calcula­ tions for the jump, these sophisticated systems are not infallible. Numerous conditions, from a damaged navicomputer to a gravity bubble created by an Impe­ rial Interdictor-class cruiser, can increase the difficulty of making a successful journey through hyperspace. Successful Smugglers must hone their own skills or employ the services of a dedicated astrogator. TABLE 3-5: LESSER ROUTES AND SMUGGLING RUNS H Y PER LA N ES, T R A D E RO U TES, A N D S M U G G L IN G R U N S Hyperlanes and trade routes are vital to galactic trade—that includes smuggling. However, because the system law enforcement and the Empire patrol major trade routes, Smugglers must resort to alternate routes, shortcuts, and runs—those often dangerous hyperroutes that only a Smuggler would risk. Smug­ glers are often competitive when it comes to run times, trying to beat their own record and those of their rivals. Table 3 -5 : Lesser Routes and Smuggling Runs lists the average time to complete some of the gal­ axy’s most notorious smuggling runs, as well as nota­ ble locations along each. Table 3 -6 : M ajor Galactic Routes (In Days Using a Class 1 Hyperdrive) (see page 78)shows the average travel time between key planets on the galaxy’s five biggest trade routes. Although these times have some basis in the physi­ cal distance between planets, numerous other fac­ tors, such as gravitational and hyperspace anoma­ lies, requisite stopovers in realspace, and indirect routes to avoid gravity wells angl other phe­ nomena greatly influence the average travel duration. Another im portant factor is the frequency of use of a given hyperroute. The Imperial Space M inistry collects sensor data from ships’ navicomput- ers as part of standard docking pro­ cedures. This information goes toward future astrogation chart updates, so the more ships that travel a given route, the more accurate and up-to- date the charts. These fac­ tors and others can con­ tribute to a discrepancy •in travel times between two given planets, depending on which is the departure world and which the arrival. Each hyperroute actually covers a broad expanse of space (and hyperspace) and is subdivided into variable numbers of channels traveling in each direction, to ensure against collisions. Variations between chan­ nels exist, and some hyperroutes receive more ships traveling in one direction than another, which fur­ ther contribute to differences in average travel time. The listed travel time is based on the average for a class 1 hyperdrive. To find the actual travel time for any hyperspace journey, m ultiply the base time by the ship’s hyperdrive class and modify accord­ ing to the results of the Astrogation check to set the course. See page 246 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook and The A rt of Astrogation on page 76 of this book for more information.

Many, however, pursue jobs involving what they see as victimless crimes. After all, transport­ ing cargo tariff-free does little except cause the Empire to lose some revenue, which it does not even miss. Oth­ ers go beyond transporting goods from seller to buyer, instead preferring to part individuals or organizations from their property. This is where theft, swindling, and other forms of larceny come into play, broadly catego­ rized as con jobs. These sorts of jobs appeal most to Thieves, Charmers, and Scoundrels. Fate or experience has perfectly tailored their talents for such crimes. Of course, a good con calls for a number of skills, allowing other character types to contribute. At the most basic level, a con is a scheme in which an individual gains the trust, or confidence, of a vic­ tim in order to defraud him. Although greed moti­ vates most cons, which have no greater objective than parting the mark from his credits or valuables, some people conduct cons for personal or moral reasons. The PCs might scam an Imperial official in order to blackmail him into assisting, or at least overlooking, their smuggling operation or halting his mistreatment of the local citizens. Holding leverage over a govern­ mental official or powerful underworld boss can be invaluable, whether the party uses it only for personal gain or to improve the lot of those less fortunate. Con jobs require at least one charismatic and con­ vincing individual to serve as the “face” of the group. Even if he is not the mastermind behind the scheme, the success of the con hinges on the face’s effective­ ness at gaining the mark’s trust. A Charmer makes a natural choice for a face, although any character with strong social skills might pull it off. STAG IN G A CON JOB Staging a successful con is a delicate act, requiring the skill of a surgeon and the cunning of a Hutt. Would-be grifters who rush into a con without a carefully laid plan are doomed to failure, possible prison time—or a painful death—depending on the inclinations of the intended mark. A successful con unfolds in steps according to the con artists’ plan, often with on-the- fly adjustments as events unfold. Although the spe­ cifics vary greatly, all cons can be broken down into five stages: finding a mark, laying the groundwork, the approach, the complication, and the payout and exit. Thinking of a con in these steps helps both the GM and players. Because a con job can grow very com­ plex, involving small yet critical details, it is best if the GM and players work together to plan the con. The GM can provide useful details and fill in the blanks as needed, as well as helping the players to concoct a plan that works within the context of the setting. Keeping the players involved helps everyone to stay on the same page in regard to pacing and how well the plan unfolds. F IN D IN G A M A R K Before a con can begin, the would-be con artists must select a mark. In most cases, the con artists must complete this stage, or at least begin it, before for­ mulating their plan. The identity of the mark, either an individual or organization, determines the options for the latter stages of the con. It also determines the potential reward for its successful completion, so the PCs must choose carefully. Con artists must consider a number of details when choosing a mark. Perhaps most important is the mark’s wealth or resources, as the entire point of a con is to obtain something of value. However, those of wealth and power are also the most dangerous marks, as they have the resources to make the PC’s lives mis­ erable should they discover the Player Character’s duplicity. Retribution could take the form of a bounty, personal security forces, or simply bringing down the weight of the law. Usually, the con artists take some time to either research or observe their potential mark before tak­ ing any further action. Details to look for include the mark’s finances, his defenses and security, his acquaintances and business partners, his tempera­ meant, and his interests. The more information they have about the mark, the better chances the PCs have to pull off their con. The CM and players can usually handle this stage narratively, with few if any skill checks necessary. The CM might even present the PCs with a prospective mark as part of the setup for an adventure of his own devising. Alternatively, the CM could allow the PCs to take the lead, asking and looking around in order to locate a potential target. GM GUIDANCE: KEEPING EVERYONE INVOLVED n long con is an intensive and time-consuming endeavor for the PCs. Whether it forms the basis of an adventure itself or is a step toward a larger goal, completing the con should take at least a full session to complete. During this time, the group’s face, likely a Charmer or Scoundrel, will get a great deal of spotlight time. While it is not a bad thing to allow some game sessions to focus on a particular character, assuming every PC eventually gets such treatment, it is im por­ tant to ensure that none of the players feel left out. The best way to accomplish this is to give all the PCs a part to play. If the players have trouble coming up with responsibilities and tasks for their characters during the planning stage, the GM should feel free to interject with suggestions for utilizing the skills and abilities of all the PCs. In-game, the PCs in question can then chime in, offering skills the others might not have even considered. In addition to long cons that form the focus of sessions or adventures, Charmers, Scoundrels, and other socially inclined and unscrupulous characters can use their abilities to enact short cons during unrelated adventures or downtime. These usually take only a few minutes in-game, with the goal of depriving an NPC of whatever credits he has on him at the time. These provide an opportunity for the Smuggler to make some extra credits while the other PCs are engaged in activities that do not call for his unique talents. LAYING TH E G R O U N D W O R K Laying the groundwork includes any and all prepara­ tions the con artists must take before the face con­ tacts the mark. This includes formulating a plan that encompasses the latter stages of the con and obtain­ ing any items, information, or other resources they might need. Vital resources often include personal details that the PCs can exploit to gain the mark’s trust. They might also include information on the sorts of obstacles, both physical and social, that the PCs should expect to encounter during the job. During this stage, the PCs develop a detailed plan for their con. This includes any disguises and false identities they will use, what they will get from the mark, and what they will offer the mark in order to gain his trust and cooperation. In most cases, the PCs have no intention to actually deliver on such prom­ ises, although they might have to give the mark some­ thing in the beginning in order to secure his trust. This is a good opportunity for characters other than the charismatic “face” of the con to contribute. In fact, if any of the preparations could potentially bring the PCs into contact with the mark or his associates, it might be best for the face to stay out of sight com­ pletely, lest the PCs tip their hand too soon. Depend­ ing on the necessary preparations, the GM might call for Knowledge skill checks to obtain additional info­ mation through research, Perception checks to gauge the effectiveness of observations and stakeouts, or Negotiation or Streetwise checks to obtain needed supplies or inside information. T H E A P P R O A C H The approach is when one or more con artists, usu­ ally the group’s face, first make contact with the mark. Often, it is carefully arranged by the con artists to look like a coincidental meeting, which serves to help convince the mark that the con artist is, in fact, trust­ worthy. The approach can take any number of forms, depending on the plan for the con, from "bumping into” the mark in a cantina to posing as a distant rela­ tive or an acquaintance of a friend or employee. A well-practiced approach is vital to a con’s suc­ cess. A careless or fumbled approach can easily undo even the most carefully laid foundation or the clever­ est scheme. At this stage, the con artists have likely already invested credits, time, and effort into the con. They stand to lose all of that if the approach goes sour and, even worse, tipping off the mark could land the characters in trouble with the authorities. The success of the approach usually falls squarely on the shoulders of the group’s face, but another PC might make contact in order to arrange a meeting with the face. In either case, social skill checks figure prominently. Deception, of course, is a likely skill, while the character might use Charm if the PCs are disguising their con with a veneer of truth. If the con takes the form of a business proposal, Negotiation might also come into play. single mistake or failed skill check. Instead, the CM should use such instances as opportunities for role- playing and to further challenge the PCs, forcing them to reevaluate their plan or think and act quickly to cover their mistakes. T H E PAYO U T A N D EXIT If all goes more-or-less according to plan, the party even­ tually obtains their prize from the mark, be it hard cred­ its, valuable information, or a priceless artifact. Depend­ ing on the specifics of the plan, and the PCs’ success in vital skill checks, the mark might willingly hand over his credits or valuables, entrusting them in the PCs’ safe­ keeping or expecting a later return on his investment. Otherwise, the PCs might surreptitiously take posses­ sion of the prize. This should require at least one more social skill check or Skulduggery check, as appropriate. In some cases, particularly as a result of unexpected complications, the PCs could have no choice but to reveal their true intentions, even holding the mark at blaster point while relieving him of his credits. Once the prize is in hand, the PCs must quickly and carefully make their exit. Ideally, the PCs take their reward and walk away peacefully, with the mark only discovering later—if ever—that he was the victim of a con. However, particularly if the plan calls for the PCs to physically steal from the mark after gaining access to his home or place of business, or if a mistake, failed check, or a ^ result alerts the mark or his allies to the PCs’ duplicity, they might have to blast their way out. A good plan prepares the PCs for either occurrence, and their ship should be ready to fly, perhaps even with one member of the group prepping for takeoff while the others complete the con. THE CO M PLIC A TIO N Although not a part of the con artists’ plan, as the other stages are, no con job goes off without a hitch. In some cases, the grifters might predict and plan for cer­ tain complications, but others can come unexpectedly. Although the PCs could encounter numerous chal­ lenges and setbacks during the course of a con job, the complication, as a stage, refers to a serious problem with the potential to completely undo all their work unless they act quickly and decisively to overcome it. Somebody appears on the scene who could reveal the face’s real identity. Something happens to make the mark suspicious and start asking difficult questions. Or perhaps somebody else lays claim to the prize the characters have been after. Whatever it is, once the complication rises, the PCs can’t ignore it. They must either tackle the complication directly, adjust their plan accordingly, or bail out of the con completely. Gener­ ally, this occurs once the con is in full-swing and the PCs are close to their goal, raising the stakes even higher. The complication could arise naturally out of the prior events in the con game, or the CM might con­ front the PCs with previously unknown events or char­ acters that threaten to scuttle their plan. If any of the PCs’ Obligation has been triggered this session, it might directly cause the complication. Of all the stages of a con, this is the most likely time for combat to occur, as the plan for a con rarely involves violence. The complication should challenge the PCs, but it should not end the con prematurely unless the PCs consistently fail to resolve it or insist on acting contrary to their best interests. Whether during the complication or any other stage of the con, the CM should not let the entire con fall apart because of a HEISTS AND BREAK-INS m any Smugglers make their living transporting goods at the behest of others, whether power­ ful Hutt crime lords, secretive agents of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, or the dreaded Black Sun. Some realize they can increase their profits and free­ dom by obtaining their own merchandise instead of acting as middlemen. However, this approach can involve exorbitant up-front costs—unless the goods come free of charge. A successful Thief makes his credits and reputation with large-scale heists, but the biggest hauls are always the riskiest P L A N N IN G A H E IST Any Thief can break into a location; the mark of a true professional is a carefully planned heist that ensures he gets in and out quickly and safely, without anyone knowing he was there until he’s long gone. For truly lucrative heists, such a plan is a necessity to get past the layers of defenses and redundant security mea­ sures that protect truly valuable hauls. Like a proper con job (see page 79), a good heist involves the skills and abilities of all members of the party, not just the Thief or other Smuggler character. Technicians can offer their expertise in overcoming technological security systems, while Charmers can distract guards or passers by. Hired Guns can make all the difference if things go south and the PCs have to fight their way out. Traders can ensure a good profit when selling any valuables taken, while Scouts can prove invaluable in reconnoitering a secure facility in preparation for the heist. Scholars might provide that vital scrap of information that makes the difference between victory and failure. SE C U R IT Y M E A S U R E S From outlaw palaces in the Outer Rim to the skyscrap­ ers of the Core Worlds, security measures range from simple locks and hired muscle to sophisticated tech­ nological systems and precision-engineered droids. This section focuses on a sampling of these devices, but it is impossible to cover even a small portion of the limitless variety. As long as there are thieves, tech­ nological research will continue to seek ways to stop them—and there will always be thieves. B Y P A S S IN G SE C U R IT Y The exact nature of a given security measure deter­ mines the skills required to overcome it, as well as the difficulty of doing so. The entries for each security measure described on the following pages list the skill or skills used to disable or bypass it. The also list the difficulty for doing so under normal conditions. As always, the GM should modify the skill check to account for the situation or to represent more- or less-advanced versions of a system. Generally, a char­ acter can get past a security measure with a single skill check, but some particularly complex or chal­ lenging systems require a series of checks. Similarly, a security system that incorporates multiple devices could require separate checks to overcome each com­ ponent. However, if some of the measures depend on a trigger device, a PC might try to simply deactivate or bypass the trigger. Sometimes, the skill of the person who installed a security measure trumps any intrinsic feature of the device. A true security expert knows the best tricks of thieves and can take efforts to render his system less susceptible to them. At the GM’s discretion, a security measure might require an opposed check. This could apply to a security system of nearly any type, from a physical lock to a laser fence. In these cases, instead of using the standard check difficulty described in the entry for the specific device, the difficulty is instead determined by the skill of the character who installed the security system. The skill in question depends on the nature of the device, but the most common are Com­ puters, Mechanics, and Survival (for rudimentary traps, such as those created using a natural environment). O BSTACLES Obstacles are generally passive systems designed to foil a thief by physically blocking his progress. Obsta­ cles are either always present or, for some facilities, activated after business hours. In some cases, obsta­ cles might activate when an intruder trips a detection device or trigger (see page 83). LOCKS Picking a lock requires appropriate tools and a Skuldug­ gery check. Particularly on the Core Worlds, electronic systems often augment or replace entirely conventional locks. Picking such a lock might require a Daunting ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Skulduggery check, although an electronic lock breaker (see page 1 78 of the E dge of the E m p ir e Core Rulebook) reduces the difficulty by two. Usually, failing the Skulduggery check to pick a lock results in wasted time; of course, this might put the Thief in danger of discovery if guards patrol the area. In addition, the GM can spend ^ to have the lock break during the attempt. If the Thief failed the check, he must find another way in. If he succeeded, the lock opens but cannot be locked again, which might alert others to the intrusion. LASER GATES AND ENERGY FIELDS Laser gates and energy fields (also called force fields) are both impassable fields of energy used to block access to restricted areas. The key difference between the two is that energy fields simply block passage, much like a physical barrier, while laser gates disinte­ grate any matter that comes in contact with it. Particularly in the case of laser gates, the high power draw requires the system to shut down briefly on a regular basis, in order to avoid overwhelming the power supply. Security designers often install multiple laser gates in a sequence, so that even if someone makes it past the first gate, they are trapped or killed by the subsequent gates. A character attempting to make it through in time must succeed on a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Athletics or Coordination check or suf­ fer damage 10 damage. Each Y on the check inflicts 1 additional damage, and the CM may spend ^ to inflict a Critical Injury. DETECTIO N D EV IC ES A N D T R IG G E R S Detection devices and triggers detect the presence of intruders. In and of themselves, these do not hinder a Thief’s progress. Instead, they either alert security forces to the threat, or they activate other systems, such as obstacles or dangerous countermeasures. SCANNERS A huge variety of scanners exist in the galaxy, from specialized models that detect the presence of blaster energy cells to full-spectrum devices that can identify a sentient’s species and vital signs. Some sen­ sors are handheld and short range, while others are omnidirectional and cover many kilometers. Usually, a scanner’s range and effectiveness correspond to its size. Scanners might be operated by visible guards or concealed within door-frames. Although advanced, scanners are not foolproof, par­ ticularly if a character actively tries to escape detec­ tion. In most cases, the GM should call for a player to attempt an appropriate skill check to avoid triggering a scanner. For a bio-sensor that checks for signs of dishonesty, such as an elevated pulse, the character might use the Cool skill. Sneaking past a directional scanning beam might require Stealth or even Athlet­ ics to leap across. Alternatively, the GM might assign the scanner an effective Perception skill, modifying any checks to account for precautions the character takes, such as removing a blaster’s power pack before passing through a security checkpoint. PRESSURE PLATES A pressure plate is an area of floor that detects the presence of additional weight when a character steps on it. Pressure plates usually mimic the pattern of the flooring around them, requiring a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Perception or Vigilance check to notice Moving across a pressure plate without activating it requires a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Coordination check A variation on the pressure plate is the contact trig­ ger. Security experts install these small pressure pads on door handles, container lids, and other surfaces an intruder might touch. If a character is aware of a contact trigger, he can make a Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Coordina­ tion or Skulduggery check in order to manipulate what­ ever device incorporates it without activating the trigger. ACTIVE S Y S T E M S A N D T R A P S Active systems and traps can immobilize, injure, or even kill intruders. Consequently, they are among the most dangerous defense systems a Thief might encounter. LASER TRAPS Something of a misnomer, laser traps are actually automated blasters, such as the BlasTech Class VI Automated Laser Projector, that either supplement or replace living or droid guards. Advantages over guards armed with blasters is that laser traps can be placed nearly anywhere and, due to their small size, are both concealable and make for difficult targets. When activated, either by a guard or when its sen­ sor detects the presence of intruders, a laser trap’s onboard computer assigns and prioritizes targets to fire upon. Laser traps fire with the profile of a blaster rifle (see page 1 60 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook) and count as having an Agility of 2 and 1 rank in Ranged (Heavy). Some laser traps can be operated remotely, in which case the guard uses his Ranged (Heavy) skill. Like a regular blaster, laser traps can placed on stun setting, either manually or in response to conditions dictated by their pro­ gramming. A laser trap has a silhouette of 0, and is destroyed if a character performs a successful com­ bat check against it. REVERSED REPULSORFIELDS Reversed repulsorfields, commonly known as man traps, create a localized held of high gravity in order to immobilize a target without harming it. Although they vary in size and shape, common models, such as the Golan Arms 1-2 Incapacitator, are rectangular, approximately one by one-and-a-half meters, and ten centimeters thick. Many reversed repulsorfields have variable settings to allow for use against creatures and sentients of varying degrees of physical strength. They might operated remotely or via a tethered control pad. Escaping from an active reversed repulsorfield requires a successful Daunting ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Athletics check A character who is not held by the trap can deactivate it with no check necessary, so long as he can access the control pad. Without the control pad, deactivating the man trap requires an Average Mechanics or Computers check GAS DISPENSERS Gas dispensers release airborne chemicals designed to incapacitate or kill intruders upon activation by a trigger or detection device (see page 83). To increase their effectiveness and reduce collateral damage, gas dispensers often trigger doors that seal the chamber, creating an airtight space. The dispenser itself might be hidden behind a ventilation duct or ■ k concealed in another device. The possible effects of the gas are almost limit­ less, but the most common varieties have mostly similar effects, either rendering victims uncon­ scious or killing them. In either case, a character must make a Hard ( ♦ ♦ ♦ ) Resilience check each round he is exposed to the gas. On a failed check, the character suffers 3 strain, plus 1 strain per <§) for knockout gas or 3 wounds, plus 1 wound per <§) for lethal gas (this is not reduced by soak). The GM may spend ^ to inflict a Critical Injury on the character. Respirators or similar equipment provide immunity to the effects of the gas. DETONATORS Some individuals and organizations would rather destroy their valuables than see them fall into anoth­ er’s hands, particularly when the item in question contains incriminating or dangerous information. In such circumstances, they might rig the chamber or receptacle containing an item with detonite or other explosives, setting it to self-destruct upon tampering, destroying the object and possibly the would-be bur­ glar. All characters engaged with the detonator suffer 1 5 damage and must make an Average Coor­ dination or Perception check Each & on the check reduces the damage that the character suffers by 1. The GM may spend ^ on the check to inflict a Critical Injury on the character. A detonator’s trigger can be tied to any of the detection devices listed on page 83, or a case or container can be set to trigger upon opening. Dis­ arming this sort of trigger requires a Hard + ♦ ) Skulduggery check or an Average ( ♦ ♦ ) Mechan­ ics check SHOWDOWNS AND SHOOT-OUTS F or most Smugglers, blaster fights are all but inevi­ table, whether with competition, bounty hunters, or even stormtroopers. Some individuals, particularly Gunslingers, relish such confrontations. However, all must remain aware of the potential ramifications of violence, and a Smuggler who carelessly draws his weapon can land himself in even greater trouble than whatever threat prompted violence in the first place. On many planets, acting in self-defense precludes a great deal of legal trouble. In some of the rougher parts of the galaxy, simply having witnesses attest that the other sentient drew his blaster first is enough to make the difference between rotting in a local cell (or being shot down by the law) and walking away without hassle. Even when embroiled in the mechanisms of Imperial law, a claim of self-defense can greatly aid a gunman. For these reasons, many Smugglers, especially when unsure of the local customs or laws, prefer to wait until their enemy draws first, as this is an accepted sign of aggression across most of the known galaxy. In a showdown, both characters want to be the second person to draw his blaster, in order to show that he acted in self-defense. Ideally, the showdown also happens In front of witnesses, such as in a can­ tina or on a street in front of a crowd, perhaps one assembled specifically to watch the duel. Of course, both characters also want to be the one to shoot first, because firing second often means not doing so at all. T H E Q U IC K -D R A W S H O W D O W N A quick-draw showdown differs from ordinary combat in how it begins. The gunfighters, usually only two of them, face off, each intending to be the second one to draw but the first to fire, thereby shooting down his enemy in public without committing a crime—and also demonstrating his skills, in case anyone else was thinking about starting trouble. A showdown begins when the two duelists face off, usually at short range, but possibly closer, at the GM’s discretion. The showdown unfolds in the follow­ ing steps: STEP 1: FACE OFF During the first step of a showdown, the two charac­ ters face off, each attempting either to intimidate the other or size him up while patiently waiting for him to draw. Depending on the nerve and experience of the combatants, this standoff might last for seconds or minutes. Veteran duelists might play the entire sce­ nario out in their minds several times before drawing. During Step 1: Face Off, each character chooses only one of the options listed on page 86: Size Up or Intimidate TABLE 3-7: SPENDING ($. © . AND ^ IN A SHOWDOWN Cost Result Options O o r(£ Perform a Guarded Stance maneuver as an incidental during Step 2: Draw (or a subsequent turn) Drop prone or stand up from prone as an incidental during Step 2: Draw (or a subsequent turn). or<£ Perform an Aim maneuver as an incidental during Step 2: Draw (or a subsequent turn).

(This can only be activated during the com bat check in Step 2: Draw) <$ $ If the attack inflicts damage, it incapacitates the target w ithout killing him. (This can only be activated during the com bat check in Step 2: Draw) The character may im m ediately make another com bat check against a different target within range. (This can only be activated during the com bat check in Step 2: Draw). <§) or ^ The character suffers 2 strain. <§> @ or ^ The character is disoriented for 2 rounds. <§> (5) <§) or ^ The character does not benefit from his ranged or melee defense until the end of his next turn. The character is immobilized for 2 rounds. A fter he attacks, the character’s weapon malfunctions. Treat this as though it had run out of am munition if applicable (see page 207 of the E d g e o f t h e E m p i r e Core Rulebook). The character’s attack hits a bystander within range (of his opponent’s choice) instead of his target. (This can only be activated during the com bat check in Step 2: Draw and if there is a target in range). The character cannot voluntarily suffer strain to activate any abilities or gain extra maneuvers until the end of his next turn SIZE UP The character attempts to assess his opponent, seek­ ing any clues that might give him the edge when both gunslingers go for their blasters. He might detect a telltale nervous twitch, a custom holster, or that the foe favors one leg over the other. However, if the character misreads the subtle cues, he might act on false information, putting himself at a disadvantage when it comes time to draw and shoot. The character makes an opposed Perception or Streetwise check against his opponent’s Cool. If the character suc­ ceeds, he upgrades his ability for the Cool check to determine Initiative in Step 2: Draw once, and once per additional & # on the check. The player and CM can also spend dice symbols as normal, or for the additional effects as shown in Table 3 -7 : Spending i l } , (&, <§>, and ^ in a Showdown (see page 85). INTIMIDATE Through anything from verbal taunts to twitching his fingers near his blaster, the character attempts to intimidate or fool his opponent into drawing first. Should the character focus too much on this attempt, however, he might lose sight of the bigger picture and overlook his opponent’s actions, put­ ting him at a disadvantage. The character makes an opposed Deception or Coercion check against his opponent’s Discipline. If the character suc­ ceeds, he adds □ to his opponent’s Cool check to determine Initiative in Step 2: Draw, and □ per additional & # on the check The player and CM can also spend dice symbols as nor­ mal, or for the additional effects as shown in Table 3 -7 : Spending O , (&, <§>, and ^ in a Showdown (see page 85). STEP 2: DRAW Eventually, one of the duelists’ nerve breaks, and he goes for his blaster. With this sign of aggression, the other character can draw his own blaster without fear of legal reprisal. Observers must watch carefully, because the gunfighters move with incredible speed. Both characters make a competitive Cool check with a difficulty of Simple (-) to determine Initiative, modified based on the results of the checks in Step 1: Face Off. The character with the lower Initiative result blinks first and tries to attack, while the char­ acter with the higher result keeps his nerve, drawing and attacking in a seamless motion. The character with the higher result takes the first turn, but he must draw his weapon (if he wishes to use it) and attack. He can use any remaining maneuvers after drawing his weapon to Aim, take cover, or perform other relevant activities. A successful combat check inflicts damage as nor­ mal, and the player and CM may spend O . (£), <§), and ^ in the usual ways and also in the ways listed in Table 3 -7 : Spending O , ($), ® , and ^ in a Showdown (see page 85). At the CM ’s discretion can also use the options on this table for any other checks that occur during Step 1: Face Off, Step 2: Draw, or the ensuing combat encounter. The GM can spend ^ for the winning character to indicate that he acts prematurely, both drawing and shooting first. This does not apply any penalties to skill checks during the combat, but it can have legal and social consequences afterward. Assuming he survives the other character’s attack, the character who goes second takes his first turn following the same rules as the first character. STEP 3: COMBAT CONTINUES Quick-draw duels are often near-instantaneous and decisive. However, if both characters survive after Step 2: Draw, combat proceeds as normal, except that combatants can still make use of applicable options in Table 3 -7 : Spending O , <o>, and ^ in a Showdown (see page 85) as the CM deems appropriate. Any characters who enter the fight at this point make Cool checks to determine Initiative. GAMBLING AND GAMES OF CHANCE A round of hintaro unfolds in the following steps: STEP 1: SELECT HINTARON At the beginning of a round of hintaro, the players must select a special player known as the hintaron. The hintaron is similar to a dealer in card games, and in casino gaming, the hintaron is almost always the hintaro dealer. In non-organized gambling, the role of hintaron typically changes each round, usually with the duty passing to the person to left of the previous hintaron. The hintaron’s duties are to collect antes and wagers, ensure each player has the chance to reroll one (and only one) die, and to throw the hintaro. STEP 2: ANTE IN Beginning with the player to the hin ta ro n ’s left, each player pays the ante to the pot to get the round going. STEP 3: THROW DICE Once the initial wager is set, each player rolls ■ ■ , which correspond to the chance cubes used in hintaro. F rom towering casinos in the Core to the back rooms of Outer Rim cantinas, gambling takes on a bewildering array of forms. Almost every homeworld of sentient life hosts its own unique forms of gam­ bling, but spacers can find certain common games almost anywhere they might travel. Although games of skill and chance remain popular as simple, low- or no-stakes diversions, the popularity and impact of gambling cannot be overstated. Fortunes, starships, lives, and even planets have all been won—and lost—at the gambling table. H IN TA R O Hintaro is a game played with chance cubes. Popular on numerous worlds, the planets of Chazwa and Cor- sin both make claims as the birthplace of the game. However, it is more likely that hintaro evolved out of similar games from several worlds. Regional varia­ tions exist, but spaceports and other communities that see a lot of travelers generally play by the same set of standard rules. Although simplified variants using standard chance cubes exist, proper hintaro uses special chance cubes with unique symbols. In a hintaro round, each player throws two chance cubes. In casino play, the house throws cubes for each player, although in recreational play, players usually handle their own cubes. Each player has the option to reroll a single chance cube once, but if so, he must take the second result no matter what. The goal is to obtain pairs of matching symbols on the two chance cubes. Once all players have rerolled or declined to do so, a single player (or the house, in casino gam­ ing) throws the hintaro, a unique chance cube with various symbols on its facings. The result of the single hintaro modifies the results for each players’ roll to determine the round’s winner. The highest-ranked throw wins the round and the entire pot. H IN TA R O IN EDGE OF THE EMPIRE Although skill checks can influence wagers and other aspects surrounding the game, the results of a hintaro match are resolved by players rolling dice to represent their characters’ chance cubes, with the result corresponding directly to the faces of his character’s chance cubes, as shown on Table 3 -8 : Hintaro Symbols (see page 88). In this way, the players clearly see the outcome of the game, rather than an abstracted result. TABLE 3-8: HINTARO SYMBOLS □ice Symbol Hintaro Name * Tukar o Kulro Y Hin @ Taro STEP 4: PLACE WAGERS Once all players have rolled the dice, each player, begin­ ning at the hintaron’s right, may wager an additional amount. The next player must meet the new bet or drop out. After the hintaron makes his decision to meet or raise, all other players must meet the new wagers or drop out. Each player adds his new bet to the pot. STEP 5: THROW AGAIN After each player has examined the other players’ rolls and made a wager, each player may choose to reroll a single die. The hintaron (or GM) asks each player in turn whether he will reroll, starting with the player to his left. As the dice roll during hintaro is not a check, talents or other abilities that affect checks cannot modify the outcome of a hintaro round. However, the Unmatched TABLE 3-9: HINTARO RESULTS Name □ice Rank i Tukar to Kulro 1 St Quad Kulro 2nd Tukar Tukar 3rd Kulro Kulro 4th Fortune Signature Ability applies to any dice roll, so an experienced Smuggler can use this to modify the results during a round of hintaro. STEP 6: THROW HINTARO AND DETERMINE WINNER Once all players have rerolled a die (or not), the hin­ taron or GM rolls a Setback die to represent throwing the special hintaro chance cube. Each T (Hin) cancels one & (Tukar) and each ® (Taro) cancels one O (Kulro). After cancelling, compare all remaining symbol sets to Table 3 -9 : Hintaro Results to determine their rank. Any sey not shown has no rank and cannot win. The best rank (1 st is highest, 4th is lowest) wins the match and the entire pot. In the case of a tie, the pot is split. If no one wins, the pot remains in place for the next round. SMUGGLER NEMESES T he life of a Smuggler is one of conflict, evasion, and deception. Allies are few, and enemies are in plentiful supply—and sometimes the only allies one can muster are enemies. A Smuggler doesn’t worry about if he will attract the ire of a powerful opponent, but when and for how long. Yet what makes an oppo­ nent truly dangerous is not who they are, but what they represent to the Smuggler and the motivations that drive them. A villain becomes memorable when he moves beyond being a one-dimensional bad guy whose only role is to be an obstacle for the players. The very best villains can even elicit empathy from the part of the players because they can understand their motivations. Depending on the actions of the PCs, some antagonists might remain on the fringes for a long time—causing trouble for the PCs, but not opposing them directly until the time is right. By giv­ ing a nemesis clear drive for what he does and why he does it, a GM makes him far more interesting and compelling as the story unfolds. The following are examples of the broad categories of NPCs that might become recurring antagonists in smuggling-based campaigns. T H E PA T RO N The Patron represents a powerful figure directly con­ nected to the business of smuggling. He may be a cur­ rent or former employer of at least one of the PCs, with the player’s Obligation determining the nature of the relationship. Most often represented as a crime lord, the Patron may also be a pirate captain from a player’s past, the owner of a casino, or a busi­ ness executive with some shady connections. Often, the relationship with the Patron starts off as being both congenial and even profitable. However, as the association continues, it begins to sour either by cir­ cumstance or design. Soon, the PCs find themselves under increasingly controlled circumstances, assigned to tasks that are either dangerous or impossible. If they break off the relationship, the Patron uses his resources to make life difficult for the group. The common motivation for Patrons is power and control. However he inherited or earned his fortune and position of privilege, he is bound and determined to keep hold of it and expand his influence. The dynamic works as long as the underlings in question understand their place. He sees those who demonstrate ambition EXAMPLE PATRON: NOHAM THE HUTT N oham the H utt is an upstart, on the run from his own kajidic due to some bad debts. Having lost the majority of his hold­ ings due to some poorly-timed investments, Noham hungers to reclaim his status. He currently inhabits Squan Station, a minor trade stop near the far-flung world of Arboo- ine, where he holds court in the dilapidated space station. Noham is an excellent recur­ ring business contact for the PCs, because he is desperate enough to deal, but still canny and avaricious. In him, the PCs might find someone willing to back even small ventures in exchange for a cut. However, if they ever grow too successful, the PCs might find that Noham has eyes for their shares of the profit, and will sell them out to get it... beyond their assigned role as threats, and he acts accordingly. He does so either to keep them under control or to eliminate his competition. Certainly if PCs have designs on, or even succeed in, a big payoff, the Patron wants in on the action. In the context of a campaign, the Patron could alternate back and forth between being an ally or adversary, but ultimately, the well-being of the PCs is not his concern. TH E LAW At some point, every Smuggler must contend with law enforcement. To be sure, “The Law" represents a very nebulous threat that is always present to those living on the fringes of society. Eventually, however, it coalesces around a particular individual who can make life very difficult for PCs. This person could be from any of the myriad of agencies around the galaxy: a local customs official, a sector-level police officer, an agent in the Imperial Office of Criminal Investiga­ tions (IOCI), or even a private investigator. Who the individual is depends entirely on where players find themselves during the course of a story. Player Characters usually run afoul of the Law in the middle of various smuggling operations. They might receive fines and infractions if an inspection does not go well. Imprisonment only becomes a problem if the Law catches them in a Class Two or Class One offense from the Imperial Penal Reference (detailed on page 3 8 4 -3 8 5 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook). If PCs are too reckless, encounters with the Law are inevitable, and they can count on spending a great deal of time trying to stay ahead of it. The individual who represents the Law in campaigns is primarily concerned about order, the status quo, and respect for authority within their jurisdiction. Rules and regulations exist for a reason; he sees them as the stitches that hold the fabric of society together. Those who represent the Law want to ensure that peace, order, and security are enforced, and they seek to stop those who don’t comply. Even corrupt individuals involved in the Law use order and the sta­ tus quo to serve their own selfish interests. Freelanc­ ers associated with the Law might be more concerned about coin than justice, but they still know and use the system to benefit themselves. EXAMPLE LAW: GRAZ THE HUNTER G raz is considered by many to be an ideal bounty hunter: professional, efficient, and extremely adept at violence. The Gank free­ lancer of few words has worked with many law enforcement agencies in the Outer Rim, and has developed a reputation for fulfilling bounties exactly to the lettered specifications with a mechanical precision. Somewhat oddly for a Gank, a species associated with acts of indiscriminate violence, Graz is known to meticulously avoid collateral damage or harm to civilians—though this rarely prevents the cyborg from bringing in targets on time. Graz is known for skill with a rifle and pistol, and also for piloting a heavily customized Kihraxz assault fighter. THE ELEMENTS F or many Smugglers, the countless hazards of the galaxy are iconic challenges in their own right. Unlike the other nemesis types, the Elements represent the physical challenges of the Smuggler career. They could be navigating the terrifying regions near the Maw, dodging giant neebray mantas in the Kaliida Nebula on the Balmorra Run, or steering through an old Clone Wars orbital battlefield. The Elements can be as much a nemesis for any group of PCs as an individual might. The difference, however, is that specific hazards do not follow the PCs, but rather, they exist as obstacles to certain goals. EXAMPLE FRIENDLY FOE: BELADI VOSI B eladi Vosi is a born swindler, having had an incredible debt hanging over her head since childhood. To survive, she has learned to be ruthless in her own way—though her brand of cutthroat business practices tend to involve departing with the cash before her partners show up rather than outright violence. She is extremely charming, and often convinces her business partners that they are really her friends—and maybe they are her only friends in a certain light, but that certainly doesn’t stop her from robbing them. Those who come to know Vosi can find a great many jobs through her, and those who come to expect her betray­ also might even make money working with her. The Law nemesis has access to substantial resources, making him especially dangerous. An individual officer may be able to call upon a small team of people in their investigations, while an agent with Imperial con­ nections could even have the assets of a Star Destroyer at his disposal if circumstances warrant it! Despite this, the Law is not monolithic so much as the Empire seeks to make it so. Often law enforce­ meant agencies end up in conflict with each other in the process of investigating various crimes. What is important to one individual may be irrelevant to, or even hamper, the investigation of another. A Law nemesis would be actively embroiled in this intrigue as part of his own work. It is possible that some might even break local laws in order to achieve their goals. THE FRIENDLY FOE The life of a Smuggler can be surprisingly collegial, with partnerships of convenience and a sense of camaraderie emerging from shared expe­ riences. This often forges close bonds amongst Smugglers. Even so, the mercenary nature of the profession keeps trust even among friends very tenu­ ous. The “Friendly Foe” is an individual who shares a strong past with one or more of the PCs, but trust is in limited sup­ ply. One can never be sure what his next move will be. At one moment, he might swoop in to save the group, and in the next, grab the loot and run. The Friendly Foe is the least predict­ able of any of the nemeses a Smuggler might face. Unlike the Law or the Patron, the Friendly Foe is most likely to appear in regular personal contact with the PCs. These characters have conflicted and complex motives, and are as much driven by their Obligations as the PCs are. They could have any number of the Motivations available in character creation, and they almost certainly have an Obligation type that puts them in conflict with the players, directly or indi­ rectly. For example, a Friendly Foe with substantial debt might feel the need to swipe a prized cargo from the PCs to pay it off. A Friendly Foe with familial respon­ sibility might betray the PCs to the authorities if it means the wellbeing of his family is looked after. He may also take actions that look like betrayal, but in the long-term, he intends to save the PCs’ lives. The presence of a Friendly Foe in a Smuggler-based campaign keeps the PCs off-balance, unsure of whom they can trust. If the betrayal is small, the Friendly Foe could return later as a rescuer, redeeming himself in the eyes of the PCs. If it is a big double- cross, the PCs might dedicate themselves to hunt­ ing the offender down, only to find their “friend” in trouble with the Patron or Law enforcement that compelled him to do it. On the other hand, he could be the true antagonist in the story; the goal of the Friendly Foe in a campaign is to keep the players guessing and keep things interesting! SMUGGLING RINGS W hile many Smugglers can eke out a living with just their ship and their wit, finding the next job is a constant concern for freelance freighter captains. Out of necessity, even the most independent-minded Scoundrel ends up doing business with the galaxy’s underworld shipping industry. Smuggling rings, regardless of their size, provide connections between clients, their goods, and the markets they seek. Smuggling rings come in a myriad of forms. The vast majority of small-time operations are legitimate businesses that take on contracts for legal goods that inevitably run afoul of convoluted customs or permit regulations. In these cases, incurring fines and paying bribes are simply the cost of doing business. More often than not, shipping companies take on a portion of their work in smuggling as necessary to stay in busi­ ness. Some companies exist simply as front-groups for much more extensive criminal enterprises, while others exist only to smuggle. E X A M P L E O R G A N IZ A T IO N S Most smuggling operations can be categorized into one of four broad types: the family, the business, the entrepreneurs, and the multi-planetary corporation. The following examples provide an insight into some of how the better known rings approach their smug­ gling business. While PCs might work for or against these specific groups, they could also work for other factions that might operate in a similar manner. THE FAMILY: HUTT KAJIDICS Hutt kajidics are an example of smuggling rings tied to a larger criminal organization that works very much like a family with comparable loyalties. A more detailed description of the Hutts can be found in the E dge of the E m p ir e Core Rulebook on page 377. If a Smug­ gler finds himself working for one of the various Hutt kajidics, he knows precisely who he is working for. In addition, while other groups actively understand them­ selves as a criminal organization, by contrast, Hutts find such a definition as irrelevant. Laws and rules that exist within the Empire or any society in the galaxy are an inconvenience at best, creations of inferior spe­ cies. To a Hutt, the only thing that matters is honor (as Hutts define it). Many Smugglers have quickly dis­ covered how unsympathetic Hutts can be if they run afoul of Imperial authorities or customs inspections. Hutts are known for lucrative contracts, but their cut of the profits can be punishingly high. Those that secure contracts for the kajidics require that 5 0-65 % of the cargo’s profits go directly into Hutt coffers. THE BUSINESS: THE TENLOSS SYNDICATE The Tenloss Syndicate (Edge o f t h e E m p ir e Core Rulebook, page 380) is an example of a legitimate business that runs a healthy smuggling operation to further its interests. The syndicate is outwardly an upstanding business, but behind the scenes, it controls numerous criminal enterprises that include smuggling operations to move its goods to markets while avoiding taxes and tariffs. The leadership of Ten- loss follows a business hierarchy model, using a chief executive and a board of directors at each level of the company. Shaped by their relative distance from Imperial control in the Outer Rim’s Bajic sector, Ten- loss is driven by profit. It engages in whatever furthers its economic interests, legal or otherwise, preferring to negotiate rather than use force. Smugglers working for the syndicate can expect iron-clad legalese in any agreement they might sign. THE ENTREPRENEURS: CAR'DAS Unlike most other syndicates that use smuggling as a means to further a primary business, Car’das is an example where smuggling is the main business—it does not produce the goods that it moves. Car’das specializes in smuggling third-party goods and info­ mation brokering, while avoiding the slave trade. Instead of a centralized group, Car’das is organized into a cell structure composed of semi-independent captains and their ships. Crews remain accountable to the central dispatching, taking on assigned smuggling jobs based on what tasks have been ordered. Captains procure their own assignments as well, provided they feed the information of their work to the leadership. THE RACKETEER: ZANN CONSORTIUM T he Zann Consortium is a relative newcomer in the galactic underworld, younger than even Car’das. Unlike the other, larger organizations, the Zann Consortium does not derive power or profits from smuggling operations. Instead, it turns its attentions to other criminal activities. Racketeering, robbery, theft, and piracy are the hallmarks of the Consortium. Its propen­ sity for violence makes this new group a grow­ ing threat to trade routes, both legitimate and otherwise. Smuggling operations for the Zann Consortium would be very few and far between. See page 380 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook for more details on this criminal ring. THE MULTI-PLANETARY CORPORATION: BLACK SUN Black Sun (Edge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook, page 374) serves as the quintessential example of a mas­ sive business conglomerate where smuggling is one side of a multi-faceted operation. Much of the orga­ nization’s success and longevity has stemmed from its secrecy. As large and as diverse as the syndicate’s operations are, it is adept at operating in the shadows. In many respects, Black Sun functions like the shad­ owy majority shareholder of many subsidiaries. Many of the organization’s holdings are legitimate business operations, whose very employees remain oblivious to the underlying criminal presence. If the PCs end up working for Black Sun, it is unlikely they will know from the outset. Rather, the group finds itself working for a smaller operation that has access to unusually lucrative contracts. Their employer’s true affiliation only becomes known if the PCs’ curiosity gets the bet­ ter of them, which can be hazardous to their health! CREATIN G Y O U R O W N S M U G G L IN G R IN G The galaxy teems with millions of inhabited worlds and countless sentient beings. Even on a single inhab­ ited world, hundreds (if not thousands) of shipping outfits move goods, legally and illegally. The immen­ sity of the galaxy means nearly limitless markets, goods, and individuals willing to pay top credit for almost anything. GMs can create their own smuggling operations by addressing the following questions: WHERE IS THE OPERATION LOCATED? Every smuggling ring has a world, station, or particu­ lar hyperspace route in which they operate. A group operating out of Coruscant will be fundamentally different from one that operates from Kessel. The environment shapes the character and nature of the group. For example, rings that operate in heavily trav­ elled routes disguise themselves as legitimate busi­ nesses. They hide restricted commodities inside of larger commercial shipments, using bribes to bypass security when necessary. On the other hand, smug­ gling organizations that operate in backwater loca­ tions move illegal goods by stealth and speed with smaller craft. Groups working under a heavy presence of law enforcement also become skilled in the art of subterfuge, while rings well away from any meaningful policing can afford to operate out in the open. HOW IS IT ORGANIZED? Smuggling operations are rarely underworld-only. Most have at least some form of legitimate business dealings, whether they present themselves as a ship­ ping company, port authority, or an antiquities dealer. Even if they are only as a front, the business dealings of this group provide an access point through which their shadier operations can run. They may be orga­ nized as small businesses with a handful of employ­ ees, contacts, and central leadership. Alternatively, if they are larger operations with a wide distribution networks, they might have multi-tiered hierarchies. Others may be less business-like, being decentralized, with individual captains and crews handling their own ships while sending a cut to the leadership. WHAT DOES IT SMUGGLE? Without exaggeration, anything and everything can be smuggled. Spice, of course, is the most common commodity that comes to mind when one hears the word “smuggler," but the spice trade remains a very small portion of what is secreted through the space lanes every Imperial standard day. In the broadest categories, an organization can smuggle goods, info­ mation, and people. Goods range from food, to spice, to weapons, to bacta. Information can be electronic, stored either on the ship’s computer, or data storage, or it can be a physical copy. People might include slaves, refugees, or any sentient who wants to avoid discovery. The larger the organization, the more likely it is to also produce the goods it smuggles. What an organization smuggles often defines its outlook and how hazardous it might be to work for. WHY DOES IT SMUGGLE? Simply put, smuggling operations want to move profitable items and avoid detection. Even if a given shipment would otherwise be legal, an organization might smuggle it to get around tariffs or sanctions. In some cases, the motive might stem from humani­ tarian reasons, where individuals are willing to break laws in order to help others. More obviously, the profit motive drives many into the smuggling business, as there is money to be made in bypassing official trade routes. Demand drives the market for almost any­ thing, including anything restricted or illegal. People will pay exorbitant prices to those who are able to deliver the goods. RIVAL SMUGGLING OPERATIONS E stablished criminal syndicates did not reach their level of power without protecting their territory. Sometimes disputes happen between organizations, while other times, internecine conflict breaks out. Either way, gang wars can get particularly nasty. While they sometimes become violent, syndi­ cate leaders often seek a diplomatic solution so as to not squander money and resources, or attract unwanted attention from authori­ ties. Even so, such agreements are often short-lived and undermined by intrigue. It is not a m atter of if the parties will break the truce, only a m atter of when, how, and if they can pin the blame on someone else. HOW DOES IT SMUGGLE GOODS? Plenty of smuggling outfits hire pilots with their own high-yield transports, which is the most likely way the PCs would become associated with a smuggling ring. Even so, smuggling techniques vary greatly from one outfit to the next. For example, some smuggling operations operate as local container-handling com­ panies that have arrangements with a bribed official. Others might have their shipping units with built-in scan-resistant hidden panels; this strategy depends on the volume of shipping traffic on its routes being so large that the risk of discovery is very small. These outfits look for recruits who can charm or bribe their way past a customs inspection if things do not go well. They might even look to contract a Thief or Gunslinger to retrieve an impounded container! WHAT IS ITS CUT? To stay in business, no smuggling organization lets a crew keep all of the profit. In some cases, such as the Hutts, the cut equals more than half the value of the cargo! Even so, the organization provides crews access to more lucrative shipments, even after they take their share. Typically, a smuggling ring takes 30-45% of the profits from a given run, with some tak­ ing as low as 20% and others above 50%. As a guide­ line, PCs can make an opposed Negotiation check to lower the percentage of the cut from a starting point of 45% or one that the CM determines. If the percent­ age is very low, the organization expects more than the profits of a given shipment. GMs should remember that Car’das, for example, considers the acquisition of information as valuable as any cargo. IS THIS GROUP AFFILIATED WITH A LARGER SYNDICATE? Smaller smuggling rings affiliating with larger organiza­ tions creates tension between freedom and finances. Larger organizations can provide steadier profit and access to wider markets, but they may also have rules and regulations that match the bureaucracy of any customs agency. It is also possible that a smuggling ring may work with a larger criminal organization with­ out the rank-and-file members knowing about it. THE BIG PAYOFF S urviving as a Smuggler means striking a balance between risk and reward: the greater the danger, the bigger the prize. The underworld trade attracts individuals who thrive on risks. Whether ferrying a choice shipment of spice, winning the jackpot in high- stakes sabacc, or lifting a rare artifact from heavy security, it is all about the payoff. Even when some­ thing goes seriously wrong, dodging the consequences can become a thrilling adventure in and of itself. For many, the Smuggler’s life on its own is reward enough, but most captains and crews are happiest when they complete a job that pays well. After all, adrenaline alone does not pay the bills! In E dge o f the E m p ir e , PCs constantly find themselves somewhere between the last job and the next big score, the latter being ever-so-elusive. GMs must strike a bal­ ance to keep the players hungry, offering good rewards to motivate them but not so good as to make them comfortable and complacent. GMs should not typically provide players with rewards so large that their charac­ ters can effectively retire. The sidebar on page 1 51 of the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook gives an excellent starting point and ideas for keeping players motivated. Possible rewards in any adventure include new gear, ships, weapons, and of course credits, but other, more unique rewards might interest smuggling crews. TH E S H IP When it comes to material rewards in adventure, nothing trumps a Smuggler’s starship. It is much more than gear, representing his whole way of life. The more capable the ship, the more likely the crew can to land the lucrative jobs. Acquiring a new craft or upgrading the capacities of a current vessel is a reward all its own. In addition, maintenance and repair represents an ongoing struggle, constantly eating away at the profit margins that any good Smuggler seeks. Smugglers often have love-hate relationships with their vessels. Many captains would rather spend their hard-earned money on upgrading the group’s current freighter than trading it for a brand new model right off the production line, even if it costs more to keep an old ship aloft in the long run. Ship-based rewards can include “free” maintenance and repairs, free assistance from qualified mechanics in installing precious upgrades, or fine-tuning to squeeze every bit of performance out of their vessel. Most of the concrete upgrades are covered either in the E dge o f the E m p ir e Core Rulebook or on page 62 in this book. More satisfying but elusive rewards GMs can provide are rewards based around the group’s ship. They may not be as tangible as a physical upgrade to a hardpoint or an engine, but they can be just as valuable. Here are a few possible ship-based rewards: • An alternate identity for the ship: One way for Smugglers to stay ahead of the game is to have their ship registered under more than one identity. Anonymity is a great asset to a freighter captain trying to remain unnoticed. If this is backed up by an altered BoSS transponder that can broadcast more than one identity, then it may make the ship more able to slip by authorities when needed. • A safe berth at a shadowport: Ports that exist off the grid become true havens for captains and crews wanting downtime. They can be a safe place to move their questionable wares, to take on ship repairs, and to secure their next job. As a crew’s reputation grows, the group might find or be offered a safe place to dock its ship at one of the galaxy’s hundreds of shadowports. • A new crewmember: The PCs should typically handle the important jobs aboard their ship, but there are many other opportunities for supporting characters, especially droids, to lighten their load a bit. If none of the PCs already handle a given job (such as medical technician, astrogation expert, or dedicated cook), the PCs could receive a droid for the task, or meet an NPC who can fill this role and wishes to join them in their adventures! W hile the most common rewards for smug- gling remain money and experience, GMs should show players that these are means to an end rather than a goal to itself. A crew might see a highly lucrative spice shipment net a profit of 4 0,0 00 credits erode to merely 5,000 credits shared amongst the crew once mainte­ nance, fuel, docking fees, and bribes cut it down to size. In light of this, players might find the example alternate rewards far more satisfying. BEYOND INCOME AND EXPERIENCE For GMs, giving the players incentives to look beyond the basic cash value of a given storyline can only benefit play. The key is balance: don’t make a Smuggler’s life too expensive without any alternate rewards. The players will want something to show for their efforts! W ithout enough rewards, the players may get frustrated. With too many rewards, they might become complacent. A GM should discuss this with his group and find what works best for everyone. THE N A M E For a Smuggler, reputation means at least as much as the goods that he helps traffick. Renown and notori­ ety are an intangible commodities that can make the difference between finding boring, menial jobs and profitable ventures. When Flan Solo boasted about the Millennium Falcon to Ben Kenobi, he hoped that his renown (or, at least, his claims of renown) would help him negotiate a better deal. Those looking for capable Smugglers, whether to pilot a ship, win a duel, or dominate a sabacc table, often look to an individual’s reputation to decide who they hire. SMUGGLER SPHERES OF INFLUENCE Reputation is not a universal resource PCs simply accu­ mulate. Rather, it rises and falls within different spheres in which the PCs operate based on the choices that they make. Renown and notoriety both have benefits and drawbacks, and the GM can use the tools here to help show the lasting impacts of the PCs’ actions. If GM wants to use reputations, he should begin by identifying a handful of spheres important to his campaign. These can be institutional, cultural, or geo­ graphic, based on the scope of the campaign. Spheres of influence can be as broad or narrow as the cam­ paign demands. Some possible examples include: • Mos Eisley • The Flutt Kajidics • The FHydian Way • Corellia • Core Worlds Fligh Society • Soldiers of the Empire and Rebel Alliance • Pirates in Flutt Space • Promise Colony • The Corporate Sector GAINING A REPUTATION Some Smugglers strive to be known as professionals, capable of finishing any job and honoring the letter of their deals, even with unscrupulous sorts. Others are perfectly willing to let a a trails of corpses speak for them. Renown and notoriety reflect the two ways a PC can be known within a given sphere: for good, or for ill. Whether a PC’s name is said reverently or whispered in terror, there are benefits and draw­ backs to being famous or feared. There are countless ways that PCs can become known in a given sphere of influence, but any major overt action can have an impact on the PCs’ reputation. At the end of a plot arc or adventure, if the PCs were publicly associated with a major positive event (setting a new record for a smuggling route, saving a town from pirates, slaying a dangerous beast), the CM can increase the level of their Reputation by 1 (see Table 3 -1 0 : Reputation Effects on page 96) in the relevant spheres. On the other hand, if the PCs were publicly associated with a major negative event (betraying and killing a Flutt crime lord, per­ forming a destructive heist, causing massive collateral damage), the GM could decrease the level of their Reputation by 1 in the affected spheres. TABLE 3-10: REPUTATION EFFECTS Level Effect 3 Beloved: Add □ □ □ t o Charm and Negotiation checks. Add ■ ■ ■ t o Coercion checks. A PC may spend a Destiny Point to find a lead to a smuggling job (or another opportunity) or a lead to a particular person he wants to find.

Add ■ ■ ■ to Charm and Negotiation checks A PC may spend a Destiny Point to have an uninvolved individual overlook one of his minor misdeeds or to cause a single minion NPC flee in terror from an encounter with him because of the weight his name carries. Generally speaking, a positive event is one that instills hope or awe in the community, while a nega­ tive event is one that prim arily inspires fear. Of course, one group’s hero is another’s villain, so some actions might have varied impacts within different spheres of influence, or even on different people in the same community. Reputation is a tool to help guide the GM in rewarding the PCs as their fame grows, but he should not feel restricted by it. BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS PCs gain certain benefits (and suffer certain draw­ backs) when acting in a sphere of influence where they have a reputation (listed on Table 3 -1 0 : Reputation Effects, above). These effects generally apply to all PCs, but can apply individually at the GM’s discretion. These apply in addition to any bonuses or pen­ alties they might receive due to personal relation­ ships. Of course, sometimes the story around a figure of legend is superseded by firsthand experi­ ence. For instance, if the PCs are Notorious within a particular region of space but personally trusted by an old friend who lives there, the □ □ to Charm and Negotiation checks from their reputation would not apply for checks with that person. Similarly, PCs who go to the trouble of acting anonymously would neither benefit from their Reputation nor enhance or tarnish it through their unsung deeds. TH E D E B T Within E dge o f t h e E m p ir e , Obligation operates as a central dynamic of gameplay. Everyone owes some­ body s o m e th in g . PCs begin the game with Obliga­ tion, indicating what they owe. As the story develops, PCs could find themselves on the opposite side of the credit chip. Some other examples might include: • Rescuing a politician from the clutches of pirates may leave him feeling indebted to the PCs. This character could provide valuable contacts or resources to the PCs at a later date. • Having acquired a surplus datapad over the course of an adventure, the PCs have the opportunity to provide an infochant some unsolicited but value­ able information in exchange for a future favor. • After a wildly successful game of sabacc, a PC loans a down-on-his-luck but well-connected gam­ bler some money. The loan could be paid back with interest, can be used as leverage for access to an off-limits area, or might give the PCs new contacts. The options for this are limited only by the imagi­ nation of the GM and the players. They can be used within the context of a current adventure, or alterna­ tively, they might become ah outstanding favor the PCs can call in when they need it. While this is very much like Obligation in reverse, favors of this type would not be quantified in the same way. Rather, players would keep a list of their contacts and what favors or debts that they have accrued with them. .
