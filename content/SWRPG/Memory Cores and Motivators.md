# Memory Cores and Motivators

1 MEMORY CORES AND MOTIVATORS Star Wars Roleplaying EXPANDED DROID OPTIONS These additional options are part of species selec- tion, and only starting xp may be spent this way. Multiple options may be selected from the Hardware and Programming categories. Standard droid species rules from Edge of the Empire or Age of Rebellion Core Rulebooks still apply. LOCOMOTION Droids use many different types of locomotion, con- densed here to a few creation options that cover broad categories. Standard humanoid legs and func- tional equivalents are the default baseline represent- ed by not selecting any of these options. JETS Whether functioning as a primary means of locomo- tion or deployed when they are needed, jets allow a droid to keep up with most flying creatures and some vehicles. Suggested Models: Advanced combat, bounty, and scouting units. Modifiers: Become a flyer (See “Flying” sidebar in EotE 202). Agility +1 XP Cost: 40 REPULSORS More common than jets, repulsor technology relies on pushing back against gravity fields, and allows en- hanced mobility and safety for a wide variety of droid models. Suggested Models: Probe droids, cam droids Modifiers: Do not suffer penalties for difficult terrain except in zero gravity. When falling, count the fall as one range band shorter. Agility +1 XP Cost: 25 ROLLING Rolling droids are able to pick up and maintain speed in a compact package. Rolling body types may fold in and out of a rolling configuration or maintain position of a head or other appendages with magnetic casters. This variant may suffer temporary separation of parts. Suggested Models: Droidekas, BB-series astromechs Modifiers: Can perform a second maneuver to move without suffering strain. They still cannot exceed the limitation of two maneuvers in a turn. XP Cost: 5 xp LIMITED MOBILITY Locomotion is not always a priority in droid design, and some models utilize simple treads, ambulatory struts, or very short legs for cheap reliability when their primary function does not rely on mobility. Suggested Models: R-series astromechs, GNK power droids, various maintenance and pilot models. Modifiers: May only use one maneuver to move per turn. XP Change: Gain 5 xp 2 MEMORY CORES AND MOTIVATORS Star Wars Roleplaying HARDWARE ADAPTIVE OPTICS Properly tuned optical sensors can be tuned to adjust to low-light conditions or include the infrared spec- trum, allowing a droid to see much better in poor con- ditions than most of their organic counterparts. Suggested Models: Recon and bounty droids. Modifiers: Remove bb from Perception and Vigilance checks, or due to concealment. Cunning +1 XP Cost: 25 ADDITIONAL ARM Some droids need to keep their hands on several con- trols at once. A popular feature of pilot droids, addi- tional arms can be useful for any droid that is asked to multi-task. Suggested Models: Pilot droids Modifiers: Reduce strain cost of second maneuver by 1, to a minimum of 0. Agility +1 (May be purchased multiple times) XP Cost: 30 AMPLIFIED VOCABULATOR When a droid needs to reach a large audience or be heard on the battlefield, they may come equipped with an amplified vocabulator to increase the volume of their voice beyond most organic limitations. These models are also programmed to turn it back down when the extra volume isn’t needed, but some cus- tomers have complained about volume stuck at full on cheaper instructional units. Suggested Models: Instructor and tactical droids Modifiers: Increase the range at which social checks may be made by 1. This includes social talents with a range restriction. Presence +1 XP Cost: 25 COMPACT Droids that need to access small spaces or are highly specialized to use very little equipment come in more compact frames than standard models. Suggested Models: MSE droids, BD units Modifiers: Silhouette becomes 0. XP Cost: 5 INDUSTRIAL Industrial droids are sometimes difficult to tell apart from piloted vehicles for beings not familiar with the particular model in front of them. Most of these units are programmed for repetitive tasks and are difficult to divert. Suggested Models: Construction droids, heavy load- lifters Modifiers: Silhouette becomes 2. 1 rank in durable. Brawn +1 XP Cost: 20 INSULATED Droids are often tasked with work in hazardous envi- ronments, but even callous owners with little regard for droid safety want their equipment functioning reliably. Suggested Models: Fire suppression units, construction and maintenance models in harsh climates Modifiers: Ignore bb due to temperature, and reduce damage from weapons with the burn quality by 1. Brawn +1 XP Cost: 25 LOAD-LIFTER A load-lifter is designed almost exclusively for moving heavy cargo, and comes equipped with the reinforced joints and servos to handle heavy loads. Suggested Models: Binary Load-Lifters Modifiers: Increase encumbrance capacity by 5. 1 rank in Athletics. Brawn +1 XP Cost: 25 USING OGGDUDE’S If you are using Oggdude’s Character Genera- tor, GM grants are one way to handle most of the benefits of these selections. The program is not designed to allow this many species op- tions, but a dataset is distributed alongside this document which adds the Locomotion op- tions as subspecies and a species option to re- duce xp by the total cost of the Hardware and Programming options selected. A gear item is also included for the Load-Lifter Hardware op- tion. A cleaner end result can be achieved by using the data editor to create a custom species for your specific set of selected options. 3 MEMORY CORES AND MOTIVATORS Star Wars Roleplaying MANIPULATOR ARMS Droids can be designed to multi-task exceptionally well, and some are provided with the arms to keep up with a number of simultaneous tasks. Manipulator arms are thin rods with simple graspers at the end for holding or manipulating small items or controls. Suggested Models: Viper Probe Droid, Server droids Modifiers: May hold up to six items at once, but count the encumbrance values of held items as cumbersome quality. Agility +1 XP Cost: 25 MIND PROBE Mind probes are used by various interrogation units to extract information from captives through the use of truth serums and other mind-altering substances injected into the subject Suggested Models: IT-O, T0-D Modifiers: Once per encounter as a maneuver, reduce the Willpower of a helpless or restrained target by 1 for the remainder of the encounter. Willpower +1 XP Cost: 25 MODULAR FRAME Custom-built droids often start from a modular frame that makes modification and customization of the model easier, a good fit for owners who want to con- tinually tinker with their droid. Suggested Models: Custom or multi-purpose models Modifiers: Increase Cybernetics cap by 1. Brawn +1 XP Cost: 25 MULTI-DIRECTIONAL OPTICS Optical sensors that face all directions or pivot on in- dependent axes allow a droid to stay hyper-aware of their surroundings and react quickly. Suggested Models: IG-units Modifiers: Rank in Coordination and Rapid Reaction. Agility +1 XP Cost: 25 POWER RESERVES The primary function of power droids is to serve as a walking battery, able to recharge or power weapons or other equipment for field teams. 4 MEMORY CORES AND MOTIVATORS Star Wars Roleplaying Suggested Models: EG-6, GNK Modifiers: Energy Transfer talent XP Cost: 5 REINFORCED Combat and industrial models sometimes need to take a beating and keep going. Extra support and tougher materials can let these heavy models withstand extra punishment. Suggested Models: Combat and industrial droids Modifiers: Rank in Resilience and Durable. Brawn +1 XP Cost: 25 SENSORS Integrated sensors allow a droid to detect life forms and technology around them. Some models have more specifically tuned sensors for other purposes such as geological surveys. Suggested Models: Scout and probe droids Modifiers: May detect all heat signatures and electronics within short range with a Simple Perception check. Increase difficulty by 1 per range band. Cunning +1 XP Cost: 25 SURGICAL Many medical models feature integrated surgical tools to ensure they are always prepared for emergency care at a moment’s notice. Suggested Models: 2-1B series, other medical droids Modifiers: Built-in right tools for the job for Medicine checks. Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25 TECHNICAL Integrated tools and SCOMP links allow Astromechs and maintenance droids to repair or interface with any system they are assigned to. Suggested Models: Astromechs, maintenance droids Modifiers: Built-in right tools for the job for Mechanics and computers checks. Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25 UPGRADED MEMORY CORE While most droids have excellent recall, they still have to prioritize storage and access. Models that need to provide deep analysis on previous observations use more sophisticated memory cores for Suggested Models: SP-4, JN-66 Modifiers: May perfectly recall previous events of the current session, or spend a Destiny point to perfectly recall an event from a previous session. Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25 PROGRAMMING Skill ranks gained through programming may stack with career and specialization ranks, to a maximum of three. ADMINISTRATION Administration droids are programmed to be socially versatile and knowledgeable in their field. Most exhib- it a rigid adherence to rules to rival the stuffiest pro- tocol droid. Suggested Models: Model 88, EV-series Modifiers: 1 Rank in Leadership, Education, and Nobody’s Fool. Presence +1 XP Cost: 25 5 MEMORY CORES AND MOTIVATORS Star Wars Roleplaying ANALYSIS Analysis programming ensures that the droid is well versed in the basics of many topics and prioritizes comparison of new data with existing databases. Suggested Models: SP-4, JN-66 Modifiers: 1 rank each in Perception, and 3 knowledge skills. Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25 CARETAKING While often a task given to unprepared protocol units, true caretaker programming prioritizes patience and oversight alongside a pleasant demeanor. Suggested Models: Repurposed protocol droids Modifiers: 1 Rank in Charm, Vigilance, and Cool. Presence +1 XP Cost: 25 COMBAT Combat programming makes for disciplined, capable soldier in the field. Many of those same models are awkward and useless in any other situation due to their highly focused programming, but advanced or bounty hunting models are more well-rounded. Suggested Models: B-1, IG, Dark Trooper Modifiers: 1 rank each in 3 combat skills. Willpower +1 XP Cost: 25 ESPIONAGE Espionage programming is most often a modification to a standard model that will look innocuous wherever it needs to work. Suggested Models: Any Modifiers: 1 Rank in Deception, Cool, and Indistinguishable. Cunning +1 XP Cost: 25 INTERROGATION Intimidation is not a skill that comes easily to most droids, but they can be programmed to be effective, particularly when they are also dosing the victim with mind-weakening substances. Suggested Models: IT-O, T0-D Modifiers: 1 Rank in Coercion, Medicine, and Intimidating. Willpower +1 XP Cost: 25 6 MEMORY CORES AND MOTIVATORS Star Wars Roleplaying MAINTENANCE Maintenance models tend to be inde- pendent, as suits their mostly lonely assignments. They sometimes grow attached to the single pilot, droid crew, or pit boss with whom they do interact with any regularity. Suggested Models: Astromechs, pit droids, BD-units Modifiers: 1 rank in Mechanics, Computers, and Gearhead. Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25 MEDICAL Medical programming includes encyclo- pedic knowledge of procedures as well as biological variances among many spe- cies. While they tend to be friendly, their bedside manner is often impeded by the blunt awkwardness common to droids. Suggested Models: 2-1B, GH-7, FX Modifiers: 1 rank in Medicine, Xenology, and Surgeon. Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25 NAVIGATION Some droids such as astromechs are used to elimi- nate the need for an onboard navicomputer, while pi- lot droids often work in tandem with one. Sometimes such models are left unwiped longer than others due to the valuable navigation data they accrue over time. Suggested Models: Astromechs, pilots Modifiers: 1 rank in Astrogation, Piloting (Planetary), and Piloting (Space). Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25 PROTOCOL The broad job of dealing with other beings is one many prefer to avoid, leaving space in the market for a wide variety of protocol models to assist with boring or unpleasant social tasks. Suggested Models: 3PO, LOM, RA-7 Modifiers: 1 rank each in Negotiation, Charm, and Xenology. Presence +1 XP Cost: 25 RECON Droids make excellent scouts, due not only to their ability to be constructed to the ideal form factor for a specific environment, but also due to their attention to details that organics might gloss over. Suggested Models: SR-series, probe droids Modifiers: 1 rank each in Stealth, Survival, and Perception. Cunning +1 XP Cost: 25 TACTICS The key strength of tactical droids is pattern analysis, allowing them to continually improve their strategies against the same opponent even during a single battle. Suggested Models: T-series, ST-series Modifiers: 1 rank in Leadership, Ranged (Light) and Warfare. Intellect +1 XP Cost: 25
