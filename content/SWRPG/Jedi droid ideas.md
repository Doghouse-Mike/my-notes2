# Jedi Droid Ideas

Knows he's a droid, or thinks he's human? Has little (astromech?) sidekick, possibly YO44, or KN3L (colonel), that's with him for repairs, or to facilitate new "powers"/software/hardware upgrades. Powers replicated through tech, push/pull with micro repulsors/electromagnets, much sensors, hyper reactions, lightening?, enhanced agility etc. 

Leaning towards knowing it's a droid, but repeatedly points out he "has the heart of a jedi" (while thumping his chest). Does actually have a human heart stowed/preserved in his chest. That might be a much later reveal though. Like he bangs on about it a lot, possibly revealed in death scene or something, pops it open and is like "look, I told you so". 

Heart belongs to ooooolllld Jedi master. This guy fought in the big with wars, injured, lost an arm at least, if not more. Was initially frustrated by how this reduced his grip on the force/abilities with it. Concocted the idea of using droids that could mimic Jedi abilities to battle the Sith/bolster their numbers. Everyone thought he was crazy, ostracised, insert "I'll show them" mentality. Sets up small operation with a load of "borrowed" Jedi artefacts/teachings/records, and works on droid project. Quickly realises he's a bit of his depth, so focuses on droids that can create better droids, and they go about iterating on themselves, and working on creating this "Droid with a Jedi's heart". Old guy eventually dies before anything near perfection is reached. Droids are dumb, think "we'll need that" and remove/preserve his heart. But they're left with a mishmash of self awareness, heuristics, iterating on designs, jedi archives, and holorecordings of the man himself, laying down his objectives for the program, along with jedi teachings of his own. These can show up later as "force ghosts" that only Cayde can see, software in his brain teaching him or whatever. Fast forward a thousand years or so, no memory wipes, a bunch of iterations and prototypes and isolated (from the rest of the galaxy) progress in hardware/programming and Cayde is what they've come up with, and are ready to send out into the world. OR they've been quietly monitoring the outside world, seen the wars go and return and go etc, which has MADE them alter the goals of the original mission, so Cayde isn't a pure Sith killing machine, bit more rounded/general Jedi. Thoroughly programmed with The Code, but also able to learn/adapt. 

Not being aware he's a droid offers some comedy options - "We don't serve your kind here", Cayde looks at YO44, says "It's ok, he's with me" or similar. Much merriment. Eventually he's gonna realise/find out though. Oh, that could be a progression point. Like he thinks he's organic, something happens, big realisation moment, "dad" voice in his head pops up, explains some of the backstory, everything's be ok etc. 

Factory location- distant planet, possibly a temple? Or ancient capital ship, guy went a little "Silent Running" and crewed it with droids, took off to be a hermit til he could return triumphant to begin mass production, end the war.
