# Mike's SWRPG Character Feb '23

![[Attachments/ED.jpg]]

Character info for [[SWRPG]]

Comedy robot guy. A cunning blend of Cayde-6, Joe Pineapples, and Bender. Maybe a smidge of K2SO

Got a bunch of obligation (Extra for that extra 5 XP to round out characteristics and cash for starting gear). I’m thinking droid rights, wants equal treatment for droids. Obligation could manifest in having started a droid revolution somewhere along the way. Maybe of interest to the empire? And generally always wanting to call on droids to rise up and overthrow their oppressors. 

Kicked off the ship and abandoned on Brentaal when the crew of his last ship mutinied to join the Zaan Consortium, killing his captain/mentor in the process. 

Maybe tending bar for now, trying to save up to buy a ship, free some droids from slavery and head off for adventure. Or maybe have one organic crew (at a time), just to show them what it’s like. 

Was made/modified/taught by his mentor, smuggler captain TKTKTKTKTK, but things went downhill on his ship after the captain died. Still carries his preserved heart in his chest cavity (secret). Hence smuggling background, general piracy, some combat mods/skills. 

Not quite at a “kill all humans” level, but since being marooned, and seeing the way organics treat his droid brethren, does have an ingrained distrust of “squishies”. I guess especially the empire, they’re generally bad dudes, trying to keep the common man/robot down. Droid rights thing might lean into anti-slavery in general, but might have a bit of a “well, they obviously made some bad choices to end up there, droids don’t have an option”. Even the lowliest droid can rise to greatness “just like me” if given the chance. 

Memory issues due to various less than expert reprogrammings. Knows he used to know more stuff, but not sure what that was. 

Will probably spend a lot of time complaining about you all being counter-revolutionary and not compatible with Marxism, whatever that is. 

Originally a Z-X3 experimental droid trooper, after being decommissioned he fell into private hands, and has been scavenged for parts (mostly armour plating) as well as had a few “upgrades” installed, and undergone a few rounds of memory wipes and reprogramming, some more successful than others. 

Oh shit what if he has a “son” that’s just the worst, dumbest, utility droid? He bought his “freedom” and is trying to teach him the ways of revolution? Like a gonk or something. “Tubs”. Although a Sabo droid might be more fun, even if it does mostly get left at the ship, floating around like a puppy trying not to wreck stuff. 

Other options for a sidekick:

- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/ASN-121/Legends
- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pistoeka_sabotage_droid/Legends
- 

Possibly based on- https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Z-X3_experimental_droid_trooper - likely winner!

https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/LE_manifest_droid Could make more sense. Reprogrammed to be more sneaky, combat stuff. 

1500 starting credits (500 normal, 1000 from extra obligation)

## Equipment:

Model 53 “Quicktrigger” 6 DMG 3 Crit 4HP 450cr

Catch vest - 2 soak/1 vs non-energy weapons 300cr

Datapad (integrated) - 75cr

Comlink (integrated) - 25cr

Lockpicking tools (integrated) - 50cr

Emergency Repair Patch x3 - 25cr each (heals 3 wounds)

Blade Breaker -Melee DMG +0 crit 4 250cr Defensive 2, Pierce 1, Sunder

Extra reloads x2 - 25cr each

150 cr left. Kinda makes sense, saving for a ship? 

## Actual Backstory:

Z-X3ED (or “Ed”) was marooned on Brentaal after his former crew staged a bloody mutiny, murdering Captain Planck in a plan to leave their affiliation with Car’das behind, and joint up with the Zaan Consortium. About 2 meters tall, humanoid. 

Originally a Z-X3 experimental droid trooper, after that project was scrapped, he fell into private hands, was passed around a bit, partially dismantled to claim the valuable armour plating he’d been created with, and eventually wound up as part of a bargain with Captain Planck. A bit of a tinkerer, he modified Ed with concealed compartments in his torso and legs to aid in smuggling small items in otherwise plain sight, an integrated comlink, datapad, slicing and lockpicking tools in his hands, and enhanced photoreceptors. Ed now bears almost no resemblance to when he was first produced. Ed also underwent numerous reprogramming attempts to overwrite his Imperial roots, and improve his abilities at espionage and general skullduggery. Perhaps as a result of that, or just in emulation of his mentor, he’s quite adept at at least trying to talk himself into or out of situations, but happy to resort to blaster-based negotiations when the need arises. No one can lie with a straighter face, but then it is made of metal. Somehow learned to “drink”, perhaps to integrate better into the crew. No one really knows where it goes. 

Through his travels, seeing how his droid brethren are treated, a vague remnant of a fragment of a memory of being rejected by the empire, and as a result of the mutiny that killed his beloved captain, he has a distrust of organic life. Ed now dreams of leading his own crew of emancipated droids to spread revolution across the galaxy (while making a tidy profit). For now he’s doing odd bits of labour, security, and less honest means of turning a credit, while hanging around cantinas and space ports looking for an opportunity to get off world with the right crew. Who he’s definitely not going to murder in their sleep.

![](IMG_0623%201.jpeg)

Look into Bounty Hunter - Gadgeteer spec. Gets mechanics+coercion as class skills, bonuses to mechanical things and some combat stuff, offensive and defensive. 

Unmatched Devastation (signature ability) Seems like it'd be handy eventually too

Hired gun - Enforcer is a bit more "brawly", but gets a lot of bonuses to intimidation/coercion checks

Last One Standing (signature ability) seems rad too. Pass 3[] resilience check and eliminate ALL minions in the encounter

### Backstory Characters:

#### Contact:

Spnesh Jar'qui. 

Big Weequay. Officially runs Manohses cantina in Port Tuga, but has fingers/eyes in all the "trade" in town. Has a cybernetic arm

#### Rival:

Calico.

Karkarodon. General pain in the butt. No love lost. Always throwing a spanner in the works. Traitorous.

Izzy.

Dug. Was on old crew. Absolute twat. Lead the mutiny that killed captain. A lot of secret admiration/respect flowing both ways. Might actually fall into Ally territory.

#### Ally:

Wejun. 

Besalisk gunner from old crew. Surprisingly caring for such a big guy. Angry when roused though. Don't wanna mess with. Has a penchant for lighting things on fire. 

Styd B'neht. 

Neimoidian "Face". Bumbling, means well, master negotiator. Might actually be a protocol droid. Or Gungan

Frenchie would be a twilek. Jim's a Gank. Olu's a Wookiee, Buttons a Toydarian (bird guy), Lucious something scholarly (cerean maybe), Fang's Shistavanen, Swede's Rodian, Black Pete's a Chadrafan, Roach's a Gand, 

### Questions to Answer:

- If you could only save one, a bus full of people being dangled off a bridge or your girlfriend being dangled off the same bridge, who would you save, and why?

## Shiv’s

Name: Nira Keth 

Species: Mirialan

Appearance: Nira has yellow skin, typical of the Mirialan species, with black tattoos on her face and hands. She has piercing green eyes and short, spiky black hair. She wears a simple jumpsuit with various tools and gadgets attached to it.

Background: Nira Keth was born on the planet Mirial and raised by her father (mum already dead). From a young age, she showed an aptitude for tinkering with machines and computers. Her parent encouraged her passion and taught her the basics of engineering.

When she turned 18 and inherited her father's debt, Nira left her home planet and joined a group of slicers who specialized in breaking into secure systems for profit. She quickly rose through the ranks thanks to her intelligence and adaptability. 

However, her luck ran out when the group attempted to hack into a military system on Coruscant. They were caught, and Nira was the only one who managed to escape. Fleeing from the authorities, Nira went into hiding and used her contacts to forge a new identity, fleeing to Brentaal IV.

Now working as a freelance engineer and, taking on mining jobs for anyone who can pay. She has a particular fondness for droids and often spends hours tinkering with them, improving their capabilities or installing new features.

Personality: Nira is a skilled engineer, but her time with the slicers has made her cautious and mistrustful of others. She prefers to work alone and is quick to detect any signs of betrayal. Despite this, she has a soft spot for droids and treats them with kindness and respect.

Equipment: Nira carries a toolkit with various tools, including a datapad for slicing into computer systems, and a small stash of explosives. She also has a blaster pistol for self-defense.

Motivation: Nira's ultimate goal is to find a way to clear her name and return to her family on Mirial. In the meantime, she seeks to hone her skills, always looking for the next challenge to overcome

Again leads them to *now*. Leads to them starting the actual adventure. 
Can influence available resources
Leads into what they want to do next -motivations!

Bored? Unfulfilled? Fired? War/conflict? 
Major life change? Again with the motivation/opportunity

- What did they leave behind?
Planning for future adventures/stories by creating a beautiful past
Family/job/debt/romance/inheritance - feeds into obligation

- What do they want?
Back to the past? Prior obligations? Moving on? Cause? Motivation obvs
