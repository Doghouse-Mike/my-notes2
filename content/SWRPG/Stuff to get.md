# Stuff to Get

Ed has a cybernetic implant cap of 6

Anything encumb 1 or less can be "built in". So that'd be blaster + knuckles + breaker + catch vest(!) + datapad + Lock breaking tools 

## Other Things I Could Have "built in":

Electronic lock breaker

Personal stealth field! 20k and restricted though. Probs save for a guaranteed stealth mission

Electrobinoculars

Palm stunner (handshake of knockout)

Concealed escape kit

# Gear

EXOGLOVE (+1 brawn, grappling hook)

[[Gadgets and Gear.pdf#page=38&selection=98,6,238,6|Gadgets and Gear, page 38]]

# Weapon Mods

[Model 53 “Quicktrigger”](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Merr-Sonn_Model_53_%22Quicktrigger%22_Blaster_Pistol) (currently owned) has 4 hardpoints

[Dragoon](https://theouterrim.co/weapons/9f9d0cbe-ed59-4ed5-b4ef-85a237fb4fd2/) only has 3HP but does 2 more base dmg, would do the job minus sig reduction +accurate 1 (adds blue boost die)

Custom Grip (accurate +1, remove 1 setback from checks)

[[Gadgets and Gear.pdf#page=84&selection=478,8,508,0|Gadgets and Gear, page 84]]

Rapid-recharge xciter (for autofire, but reduces accuracy) Autofire increases difficulty of check by 1. Inaccurate 2 adds setback die

[[Gadgets and Gear.pdf#page=89&selection=36,3,90,12|Gadgets and Gear, page 89]]

Set Trigger (automatic advantage on first attack of each encounter)

[[Gadgets and Gear.pdf#page=90&selection=480,0,494,12|Gadgets and Gear, page 90]]

Weapon signature reduction (increase difficulty of scanners to detect weapon)

[[Gadgets and Gear.pdf#page=94&selection=507,1,517,2|Gadgets and Gear, page 94]]

[Paired weapons](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Paired_Weapons)

# Armour and Attachments

[Catch Vest](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Catch_Vest?so=search) has no hardpoints. Maybe swap out for something else that will fit under my coat, has HP, provides similar bonus (2 soak)

[Smuggler's trenchcoat](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Smuggler's_Trenchcoat?so=search) also no HP :(

[Laminate armour](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Laminate_Armour?so=search) has 2 soak, 3 HP

[Armoured clothing](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Armoured_Clothing?so=search) has 1 def/1 soak/1HP

[Gundark Scav-suit](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/%22Gundark%22_Scav-Suit) has 1/1/2, boost die to perception checks

[Verpine Fiber Ultramesh](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Verpine_Fiber_Ultramesh_Armour) 2/1/2

# Cybernetics

CAAF-2 avionics interface - +1 piloting

[[Gadgets and Gear.pdf#page=116&selection=668,7,670,1|Gadgets and Gear, page 116]]

Escape circuit- fits with character, restraining bolts can be resisted with an easy discIpline check. 

Implant armour, +1 soak

Cyberjack, acts like slicer gear

Multitool hand

Networked slicing uplink

[REPULSOR FIST](https://star-wars-rpg-ffg.fandom.com/wiki/Repulsor_Fist?so=search)

Arms/legs? +1 Brawn OR +1 Agility per limb. Might be hard sell though, my arms are already cybernetic. 10k a pop though, pricy

Brain implant +1 int as with arms

[suggests](https://reddit.com/r/swrpg/comments/6j3736/cybernetics_on_droids/) droids *do* qualify for the limbs/brain bonus. Look at it as upgrades vs strict replacement as it would be on an organic being

"Custom built" limbs are in the special modifications book. Grant boost?

# Other Stuff

Lando's capes! Perception check to pick a good cape and upgrade charm check(s)

[[Gadgets and Gear.pdf#page=134&selection=330,5,330,6|Gadgets and Gear, page 134]]

Weapon maintenance kit, adds 2x boost to repair/maintain/modify a weapon type

Droids cybernetic limbs
