# SWRPG Session 11

2024-06-13

On Columex. Landed in sector 1. Sector 4 is off limits for some reason. 

Major trade route, cleared customs etc no biggie on way in, may get scanned on way out once we've presumably got stuff. 

Mouth is coming with on this one but playing incognito

Deebo's got a map of where he thinks we need to go. 

Spaceport has news about cordon around sector 4. Surprising no one, Deebo's red dot is in sector 4

News screens on in the spaceport, cordon around sector 4, supplies going in, but still restricted. News didn't say *why* it was cordoned off though

meatbags ruined me charming the barman. Did spot another Miralan though, getting a bit of traffic/selling/buying in the bar. An individual in demand. Is being eyeballed by some stormies though. 

They start to lead him away (not in cuffs. Nira legs it, Ed shouts "stop, thief" to try and get their attention/distract em

Holy shit that worked. 

So matey boi comes with us as we head to the back door, which conveniently has cover. 

Jax Korr is our new pal, gone back to his place. Got his comm deets

Can get us through the cordon via the shit pipe. Voss is an imp that's open to negotiation. There are droids manning it too. 

Cordon's up because the imps have released a virus or something similar to cover up cracking down on the rebels that are in sector 4. 

Into Jax' speeder! There's some cargo to run too, food/rations to bring in. Squishies have some PPE on to keep em safe. Some meds to go in too. "General supplies". Backpack each worth. 

Into the tunnels, not a lot of light

Boring. Scene swipe to us in the sewer. Mouth's nice n sealed in. His constant whistling is annoying. Sewer's stink. Backacks on. There are some stairs that'll pop us out within the cordon. 

Once we're out either dodge patrols and/or speak to droids to get in the tradesmen's entrance. 

At the *inner* cordon now

Snowy convinced the droids watching the cordon that we were here to perform a QA on the medical containment. 

We now have a map. 

Snowy stepped in shit though. Actual human? Shit

PPE will probably break if despair is rolled, eek. Although that could be our "sample", silver linings

Jobs:

Fake QA

Deliver Jax's stuff - Profit

Deliver Deebo

Escape with a live sample of the virus
