# Star Wars Saga Edition - Scavenger's Guide to Droids

® SCAVENGER'S GUIDE TO DROIDS RODNEY THOMPSON, STERLING HERSHEY, PATRICK STUTZMAN, ROBERT WIELAND USINO THIS BOOK The contents of this book are intended to help both players and Gamemasters create new and improved droids. Players will find expanded rules on creating droid heroes, while Gamemasters will find new information detailing the creat ion of droid GM characters and droid enemies to challenge the heroes wherever they might go in the galaxy. Chapter One is devoted to droid heroes. Players who want to create droid character rs to play will find new rules on creating a fully detailed droid with which to adventure alongside organic characters. This chapter presents new talents and feats to help make your droid character unique. Also, informa- tion about those companies that manufacture the various types of droids can be found here, along with what a particular brand name brings to the droid that bears its name. Also included are several stock models that can be used as springboards to help players quickly put together droid heroes and jump into the adventure. Chapter Two looks at droids from the other side of the gaming table. Drold Gamemaster characters are the subject of this chapter, in which the Gamemaster will find more information involving new game mechanics behind the portrayal of droids in the galaxy, including an analysis of what role droids play in the Star Wars universe as well as in the roleplaying game. Discussions about how droids should work with and beside organic characters and how they should behave toward those around them can be found here as well as tips on how to make a droid more than just a piece of hardware.' Chapter Three delves into new equipment that can be used by droids or those who work with them. New weapons and equipment that droids can use or have installed into their chassis are found here, as well as new weapons and equipment that nondroids might opt to use on or against them. New starsh ip and vehicle equipment and systems relating to droids can be found here as well. Chapter Four is the Droid Codex, in which many new droids are detailed. The contents of this codex, however, are different from other statistics block entries. Along with the standard statistics block and description, each entry includes a section that describes how the particular droid can be used as equipment by a player character, a sidebar detailing ways to build a droid PC modeled after it, and suggestions about how the droid could be altered to perform functions not normally allowed by its original programming. Throughou t the droid codex, you will also find sidebars that present adventure hooks relating to the various droids. Each of these sidebars is presented from the point of view of a particular individual: .. Klikk is a Jawa trader: a scavenger and a junk trader from Tatooine. Most of his experiences with droids involve their technical side, and his discussions are about equipment, making repairs, and rebuilding droids. 9 Raalo is a Toydarian junk dealer who, despite being highly adept at making repairs and modifications to droids, is more interested in the business side of his operation and seeks to make as much profit as possible. His discussions focus on buying and selling droids, obtaining droids (both legal and illegal) through the Black Market, and relating details about droids that he has peddled or purchased in the past. e Mavven is a Besalisk arms dealer who travels the galaxy. His business connections bring him information and firsthand experience with 4th- degree droids, and many people consider him the leading expert in combat droids. His discussions revolve around droids in combat, espe- cially their involvement in battles and martial applications such as work in the military, in mercenary organizations, and in security. . .. EV-6T6 is an EV-Series supervisor droid. Her position, in which she deals with droids as an authority figure, is most often held by an organic being, and it gives her a unique perspective. Her discussions primarily focus on droid-to-droid interactions and on methods of dealing with different droid personalities. A DWARF SPIDER OROID ON KASHVVYK Knowledge (Technology) DC RESULT 10 15 20 Droids of all kinds are built on Mechi s III, and competition for contracting the facilities is fierce. Arakyd builds many of its droid s on Mechis III and is a domin ant influ ence during the rule of the Empire. Add itionally, some e facil ities are dedicated to produ cing sta rships, vehicles, and other technological good s. Droid designs are produced on other wo rld s, at the va rious manufac t urers' headquarters. Most manufacturers re ly on droid quality-control units to supe rvise the manu fact uring process ; however, a fe w org anic bein gs are assig ned to oversee the facilities. TELTI Region: Inn er Rim Climate: Arid (indu strial) Gravity: St andard Moons: 0 Length of Day: 22 sta ndard hours Length of Year: 309 local days Sapient Species: 99% droids and auto mata, 1% Humans and other spec ies Government: Corporate Capital: Dome 01 Major Exports: Droids, technolo gy Major Imports: Industria l raw material s OROID MANUFACTURER TRAITS A droid reflects its manufacturer in many ways-physical design, reli- ability, signature systems, and even personality traits. Some companies and model lines become known for these attributes, good and bad. Since all droids are also individuals, the influence of such traits varies greatly from unit to unit. A manufacturer's descriptions include typical traits or attributes that apply to the droids it manufactures. These traits can be added as a template to any droid manufactured by the company, although their usage is optional in game play. Knowledge (Galactic Lore) DC RESULT 10 The moon Telti is one of the main droid foundries in the galaxy. 15 The world has no atmosphere and is cover d in automated droid manufacturing plants. 20 The manufacturing faci li ties are located inside enormous domed struct ures th at are linked by tunnels and overl and transportation co rridor s. They are protected by battle droids and sec uri ty droid s and operated by serv ice droid s and labo r droids. Knowledge (Technology) DC RESULT 10 15 20 All types of droids are built on Telti, but Cybot Gala ctica and Industrial Automaton dominate the production lines. Veril Lin e System s is also a major presence. Just prior to th e Clon e Wars, Baktoid Combat Automata closes down its faciliti es on Telti in response to di sa rmam ent laws directed at the Trade Federation . Major droid manufacturers use Telti faci lit ies . The pl anet nearly run s it se lf, w ith t he exce ptio n of the co nstant need for raw material s. Rumors sugge st th at only y one organic ma ster, su pported by count less droids, is needed t o oversee th e automated factorie s and droid systems. However, most com panie s maintain at least a representative prese nce of organic superviso rs on th e world. MA..JOR OROID MANUFACTURERS Arakyd Industries Bolstered by the rise of the Emperor and a skillful political strategy, Arakyd Indu st ri es is the primary producer of the Empire's military droid s. Th e co mpany 's spec ialties are exp loration droid s and probe droid s, but it also produces co mme rcial units. Arakyd 's market dominance enables it to supp ly the New Republic in later years, de sp ite the company's Imperial dealings. It also contracts w ith other major fo rces, such as planetary governments and t he Secto r Ran ge rs. Arakyd utilizes M echi s III plants, among oth ers. Traits: Arakyd units are well known for th eir inten se mi ssion focus s, occa - sion all y going beyond the expected limits of their programming to achieve a mission object ive. When confronted with an action that it would normally not be abl e to perform du e to its beh av ioral inhibitors, it can attempt (through twisting logic or reprogramming) to bypa ss th e normal limitation s. On ce pe r day, an Arakyd droid can make a Persuasion check or a Use Computer check agai nst a DC equal to its own Will Defense. If the check is successful, the droid's behavioral inhibitor allows it to take prohibited actions un t il the forbid den ac ti on is co mpl eted . After com pl etio n, the inhibitor return s to normal functioning. ,- I n I ~ 1) -t II! ]J - - ( @ ?] @ @ ~ (ij) ?] @ (ij) @ OROID BUIl_DERS o So, you want to know about droid manufacturers? Well,l can tell you a few things. First, people have their sentimental favorites. However, as a buyer, it pays to know that Cybot's standard parts are plentiful and inexpensive, while Veriline's droids can take a pounding. The manufacturer is important, but most people buy their droids used, so I think it's more important to know the droid's recent repair history and if it's been rebuilt with nonstandard parts. You want galactic servicing and support? Better buy from the big guys. You want modifications? The authorized shops won't add on unauthorized parts, no matter how useful. Find your local droid shop-preferably one that specializes in your kind of droid. Believe me, you don't want someone learning on your job. They might swear that all droids are the same, but they're not. And you don't need your battle droid to suddenly worry about proper etiquette mid-battle. Always remember, the biggest and best known companies build decent and highly resilient machines, but the best built come from custom droid shops. Serv-O-Droid Serv-O-Droid is one of the galaxy's older and more successful droid manu- factu rers. Spa nning thou sa nds of years, from the t ime of t he Old Republic until the years before the Clone Wars, Serv-O-Droid specializes in service droid s and worker droid s, includin g personal assistants and heavy duty com- mercial labor units. However, the com pan y makes a series of bad business decisions, allying with t he Republic c's bureaucracy. The result is a po litical nightmare. Corrupt Senators give the company tax breaks and ot her favo rs but dem and great monetary and po liti ca l paym ents in return . As the co rrupt Republic declines, so does Serv-O-Droid, de spite expanding into security and professio nal assist ant models. Its asse t s are liqu id ated and so ld off to the Corporate Sector Authority. However, new uni ts are st ill ava il able through the Droid ReS erve, a droid remainde r reseller located on Elshandruu Pica. With milli owns of fully ope rati onal units to se ll , the reseller makes Serv- O-Droid unit s and spare parts available for years. Traits: Serv-O- Droid s are highly reliable unit s. When recharging, they can remove one persistent condi ti on that requires repairs to remove per day, moving + 1 step on the condition track. Tendrando Arms The Yuuzha n Vong inva sion decimates the gala cti c droid market. Because of theirfana tical hat red of mechan ica l automaton s, the Yuuzhan Vong raze droid pl ants by the t hou sands, destroy ing or disabling companie s and cau sing the shutdown of plants far from the invas ion corridor. Lando Calri ssian and hi s wife, Tendra Risant, restart seve ral idle factories w ith their new company, Tendrand o Arms, producing droids specifically designed to battle the Yuu zhan Vong. With the defeat of the Yuuzhan Vong, Tendrando Arm s provide s secu- rit y, guardian, and related droid s to the Galactic All iance and the Jedi Orde r. Traits: Tendrando Arm s droids are efficie nt securi t y and comba t droid s. Their YVH droid design (see page 158) angers the Yuuzhan Vong at a primi- t ive level. Tendrando Arm s dro id s use thi s antagon ism to their advantage. A Tend rando Arms droid ga in s a +2 ci rcumsta nce bonu s to its Reflex Defen se and Will Defense again st Yuuzhan Vong. Veril Line Systems Veril Line Systems, often called Veri line for short, ·excels at indu st rial droid design. Its units are pl ain but reliable and durable, and its signature power droid s ca n be found in most starpo rt s. Veriline units feature highly efficient proce ssing system s. The droids hav e only enough proce ssing and analytical ability to fulfill their simple and monotonous j obs. When dealing w ith ta sks or situa t ions beyond their programming, Veriline's cheaper units are simpli s- tic at be st, and downright stupi d at worst. Units that req uire sophisticated programming receive exactly w hat they need to be successfu l, but no more. Veriline is headquartered on Coruscant and ut il izes Telti droid plants as well as assembly lines of its own on or near major industria l wo rld s. Traits: Veri l Lin e System s dro ids are hi gh ly resilient. Onc e per day, a Veril ine droi d can make a DC 20 Enduran ce check to extent d its run time by 25 hours or t o move + 1 ste p on the condi ti on track . DRCID QUIRKS Droid s are t emperamental machine s, exposed to every kind of enviro nm en- t al and physica l abu se. With limited programming an d typically defi cien t maint enance schedules, many droids develop odd mechanical glitches and personality quirks. Most are mi nor-m ore annoya nces th an anyt hing danger- ous. Memory w ip es can elimina te personality quirks, but they do nothing fo r physical abnorma li ties . QUIRKS AS PERSISTENT CONDITION S Another way to include quirks in the game is to apply one when a droid suffers a persistent condition. This allows the Gamemaster to use many quirks over the span of a campaign, and provides a rich source of plot hooks, humor, or dramatic situations. The Gamemaster should select a quirk that is related to the origin of the persistent condition. For instance, a persistent condition caused by physical damage should inflict a hardware quirk, whereas a hit from an ion weapon might cause either a hardware or a software quirk. Quirks applied in this manner should be automatically removed when the persistent condition is removed, instead of requiring the skill checks normally needed to eliminate a quirk. ~ n I ) II of ~ I J @ 2!l @ @ ~ [ijJ 2!l @ [ijJ (l]) l OROID TALENTS Droid talents wo rk t he same as the talents presented in the Saga Edition core rulebook. However, each tale nt is availab le only to droids of a particular degree. When a character wou ld norma lly gain a ta lent, such as when attain- ing an odd-numbered level in a heroic class, the droid can select a droid talent from among those presented below. FIRST-DEGREE DROID TALENT TREE Known Vuln erability : You know the vu lnerable spots to hit on most species. As a free acti on, you make a DC 15 Knowledge (life sciences) check (DC 25 for rare species, DC 35 for unknown species, both as determined by the Ga memaster). If the check is successful , until the end of the enco under, whenever you make a successful melee or unarmed attack that deals damage against a target of t hat species, your target takes a -2 penalties to attack ro lls until the end of your next turn. Prerequisite: Trained in Know ledge (l ife sciences). Medical An alyzer: You use your medical know ledge and advanced droid processor to improve your treatment of medical conditions. When making a Treat Injury check to Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Radiation, you can also add your Inte lli gence mod if ier to your roll. Prerequisites: Trained in Knowledge (life sciences), medical dro id. Science Analyzer: You use your extensive databanks to better ana lyze scientific data. You can add double your Inte lligence mod ifier to your Knowl- edge (life sciences) or Knowledge (physica l sciences) skil l check. Prerequisites: Trained in Knowledge (life sciences) and Knowledge (physi - cal scie nces). Triag e Scan: As a standa rd action, you can make a DC 20 Treat Injury check. If the check succeeds, yo u know if the organic cha racters within 6 squares and within your li ne of sight are below one half of their hit points and at what step they are along the cond ition track. Prerequisites: Trai ned in Treat Injury, med ical droid. SECOND-DEGREE DROID TALENT TREE Burst Transfer : You can doub le the amount of data transferred with the Binary language in a single round (see page 191 of the Saga Edition core rulebook ) when communicat ing with other droids with Burst Transfer, and you cu t Access Information t ime in half when making Use Computer checks to find genera l or specific information (see page 76 of the Saga Edition core rulebook) . On-Board System Link : Whi le aboard a starship or veh icle and plugged into the ship's systems by scomp link, droid socket, or basic data port, you can reroute power or recharge shields as two swift actions instead of three. Quick Astrogat ion : Your speedy electronic astrogation-calcu lation routines allow you to cut calcu lation t ime in ha lf. Addit ionally, when attempt- ing a Use Computer check to Astrogate, you can make the calcula tion as a standard action instead of a full-round action. Prerequisite:Trained in Use Computer. Sco mp Link Slicer: Your inherent speed and advanced ski ll reduce the danger of sl icing computer system ms. You must be physically linked to the system you are slicing . You can use each of the fo llowing acti owns once per encounter: • Eradicate: You can use Disable or Erase Prog ram on a computer that is friend ly or helpful toward you. With th is talent, disable ing or erasing a program take s 5 minutes and requires a DC 15 Use Computer check (see page 76 of the Saga Edit ion core ru lebook). • Lockout: If you succeed on an opposed Use Computer check when you Issue a Routine Command to counteract another programmer's actions, you automatical ly lock the other programmer out of the system. He or she must succeed in an op posed Use Computer check agai nst you to regain access to t he system (see page 76 of the Saga Edition core rul ebook). You resist the attempt as a reaction. • Untraceable: As a reaction, you automatica lly keep a hosti le computer from t raci ng your location if yo u f ai l a Use Compute r check (see page 76 of the Saga Edition core rulebook) by 10 or less. Prerequisites: Any two ta lents from the Slicer Talent Tree (see page 47 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). Burst Transf er can be one of these talents. THIRD-DEGREE DROID TALENT TREE Nuanced: You are skilled in the nuances of diplomatic speech and ges- true s. Once per encounter, you can add your Wis dom bonus to a Persuasion check in addition to your Cha ri sma bo nus. Observant : You enhance your persuasiveness by app lyin g data obtained through observation . Whenever you wou ld fai l a Persuasion check, you can roll a Perception check as a free action , with a DC equa l to the DC of the Per- suasion check. If you succeed , add +5 to the ori gina l Persuasion check resu lt. Supervising Droid : You are programmed to oversee other r droids. You can use each of the following actions once per encounter : • Combat Support: As a standard action, you automatical ly aid another on an al lied droid's att ack roll, provided you are capab le of using the aid another action to assist that al ly. If you also have Weapon Focus with thi s weap on, you increa se the bon us provided by the aid another act ion from +2 to +3. • Director: As a standard action, yo u auto matica lly aid anoth er droid with a skill you are traine d in. If you also have Skill Focus in th e skil l, you increa se the aid another bonus fro m +2 to + 5. • Instant Action: As a swift action, you gra nt one ally a swift action that it can use immediate ly as a free action. Prerequisites: Observant, any ta lent from the Infl uence, Inspiration, or Leadership Talent Trees (see pages 43 - 44 of the Saga Edition core ru lebook). Talkdroid: You know how to subtly massage translations. When one of your allies is attempting to use the Persuasion skill to cha nge th e attit ude of a creature that does not understand your ally, you add +2 to the ally's Persuasion check results if you perform t he trans lation. Prerequisite: Tra ined in Persuasion . OROID DATA PORTS For the most part, Gamemasters and players need not worry about the exact type of data ports and other connections between a droid and a computer, a vehicle, or a network. However, the Gamemaster might decide that this information should playa part in the story or would otherwise logically come into play. For instance, it might make sense for an astromech droid to be able to slice into a complex computer system, but a lowly power droid probably does not have the equipment for it. Also, rare or alien droids or those from another era might have nonstandard ports. Certain talents and feats described in this book require a link in order to function. Below is a brief summary of the standard data ports found in the galaxy. Maintenance Data Link: All droids come standard with at least one maintenance data link port for programming and maintenance. This wired link can be used with data pads, portable computers, and systems designed for implementing droid modifications. This link is not normally suitable for the droid to use to attempt slicing or controlling a vehicle or automated systems. Any attempt to do so suffers a -10 penalty to any Use Computer, Mechanics, or other skill checks. This penalty does not apply to skill checks others make to the droid. Basic Data Link: Droids are equipped with one or more basic data links. This wired link allows a droid to transfer data efficiently and enables equipped droids, such as pilot droids, to operate computers and ship systems without physically touching the manual controls, although that capability usually depends on the system rather than the droid. The port is suitable for data transfer, vehicular control, and slicing attempts. Scomp Link: This advanced droid-computer data link is found on star- ships and on larger computers and networks. This port is suitable for all types of data transfer, vehicular control, and slicing attempts. See the scomp link equipment entry on page 62 for additional information. All astromechs are equipped with scomp links, unless otherwise noted. Wireless Link: Some droids have the hardware to access wireless data links. This type of link is only operable when a computer or network also has wireless capability. Accessing networks typically requires passwords or slicing. However, once connected, this type of link is suitable for all types of data transfer, vehicular control, and slicing attempts. An inte- grated comlink does not allow a droid to access wireless data networks or make slicing attempts wirelessly. FOURTH-DEGREE DROID TALENT TREE Just a Scratch: Once per encounter, as a reaction, you can reduce the damage from a single attack that targets your Reflex Defense by an amount equal to your Fortitude Defense. Prerequisites: Equipped with medium or better armor, proficient with that armor. Target Acquisition : Once per encounter, as a sw ift action, designate an enemy target within line of sight as an acquired target. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for all attacks aga in st that target until the end of the encounter, as long as the target remains within your line of sight. Target Lock: You lock onto the target designated by the Target Acquisition talent. If the target leaves your line of sight, you automatica ll y reacquire the target lock as a reaction if the target comes back with in your li ne of sight. You also gain a +5 bonus to your Perception skil l when opposing the target's Stealth checks . Prerequisite: Target Acquisition. Weapons Power Surge: Once per encounter, as a free action, you can increase the damage dealt by one of your weapon s by 1 or 2 damage dice in exchange for moving - 1 step on the cond ition track for each die increased. The weapon must be permanently mounted to your chassis, and it must use your interna l power supply. Hand held weapons, such as blaster rifles, do not qualify for this talent. FIFTH-DEGREE DROID TALENT TREE Durable : You are particularly durable and continue to function when a lesser droid would become disabled. The first time during an encounter that you would be moved to the bottom of the cond ition track by any effect, you instead stop at the - 10 step. Additionally, if a single attack causes you to move multiple steps down the condition track, you can spend a Force Point as a reaction to only move -1 step down the condition track. Heavy-Duty Actuators: Your heavy-duty actuators allow you to release your power and speed in a quick burst. You can double your Strength bonus to your melee and unarmed damage rolls. Prerequisite: Medium or larger size. Load Launcher: You are considered proficient with improvised thrown weapons (see page 150 of the Saga Edition core rulebook) when making a ranged attack by throwing an object. Objects up to one size category larger than you can be thrown up to a number of squares equal to 2 x your Strength bonus (minimum 1 square). Additionally, you add your Strength bonus to any damag e dealt. r- n I ) 1) -I (II lJ ( @ ?J) @ = @ ~ liD ?J) @ liD ® C-3PO IN PIECES New Optional Rules The following new optional rules can be included, in whole or in part, in your game to give droid heroes some of the versatility seen in the Star Wars films. As with all optional rules, inclusion of the following rules in the game is subject to Gamemaster approval. Sacrificial Appendage: When a droid would normally be reduced to 0 hit points or moved to the bottom of the condition track, the droid can choose instead to have one of its limbs severed . If the droid chooses this option, it is instead moved to the -10 step on the condition track, or, in the case of being reduced to 0 hit points, it retains 1 hit point. The sacrificed appendage shou ld be a limb rather than a tool that the droid can easily do without. The appendage can be successfully reattached with a repair check (see Repair Droid on page 29) . The droid receives hit points from the repair, as usual. Destroyed Droids: Taking into account the method of destruction, the Gamemaster determines what parts of a droid remain after it is destroyed. Blaster fire or an explosion might scatter small and large pieces around the area. A droid destroyed by a lightsaber might have slices or holes burned through it s chassis, or large sections of the droid's appendages might be completely severed. The Gamemaster should also determine which of the droid's systems, accessories, appendages, or tools are damaged or destroyed. Reactivating a Destroyed Droid: At the Gamemaster's discretion, a char- acter can attempt to salvage and reactivate a destroyed droid. Reactivating a droid requires that its processor, power source, and commu nication interface must be intact. The battery and communication interface can be replaced or replicated if needed. A destroyed droid cannot reactivate itself. The character attempting the reactivation must make a DC 20 Mechanics check and work on the droid for 5 minutes. A character can attempt to reactivate a droid as a full-round action, increasing the DC to 30. If the check is successful, the droid moves + 1 step on the condition track. However, the droid is still con sidered to have 0 hit points and cannot move, attack, or take any action other than skill checks for skills based on Inte lli gence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Salvaging a Destroyed Droid: Salvaging a destroyed droid requires a tool kit, time, spare parts, and additional Mechanics checks (see Repair Droid on page 29) . A reactivated droid can assist in its own repairs by using the aid another action, although it cannot attempt to repair itse lf directly. The time required to salvage a droid can be affected by the level of destruction sustained by the droid. Repairs might take severa l hours, several days, or even several weeks, as determined by the Gamemaster. Destroyed droids usually require spare parts costing 50% or more of the droid's original cost. IMPROVISED OR OID TASKS Heroes might try to take maximum advantage of the unique resources a droid offers. A droid's built-in equipment, traits, and unique social status in the Star Wars universe cause droids and droid heroes to be cal led upon to carry out tasks well beyond their origina l programming. When considering an unusual request for or by a droid character, consider the following: Does the droid have a heuristic processor? If not, then the request must be governed by the standards of the basic or remote processor, so the task must be laid out in specific terms. Unless the request is defined in ways the droid understands, the droid cannot act beyond its programmed skills, feats, special abilities, and tasks. Even if the tasks are clearly delineated, the droid might perform them poorly or inefficiently or become confused if the task does not proceed as planned. A droid equipped with a heuristic processor is better equipped to handle unusual situations, so it can act on fewer, less specific instructions. Additionally, focusing on the advantages of the heuristic processor emphasizes the choice of processor in droid creation, rewarding those players who select it. Mass production is another adva ntage of a droid enemy. A villain can manufacture forces in a production facility rather than spending years train- ing organic military force s. Even if the facility is discovered and destroyed, the designs for the droids exist somewhere. Not only can they be rebui lt, they droids can be improved upon to match the heroes as they rise in level. Finall y, physical destruction do es not guarantee that a droid is defeated. Memories can be uploaded to replacemen t models. The droid can learn what went wrong in its last clash with the heroes, and improve its effectiveness in combat each time it encounters them. A dro id's persona lity might even be uploaded into a different model of droid to seek vengeance. the battle droid bounty hunter might now be in the body of a labor droid, preparing an attack wit h a heavy cargo contai ner. Droids also make exce ll ent henchmen. Perhaps an assassin droid has been sent after the heroes, filling the encounter with blaster f ire and heart-racing combat. Labor droids can be muscle for a crime lord in control of a starport. A protocol droid can fou l up sensiti ve negotiations by mistranslating to benefit a mysterious thi rd party. Even an astrom ech droid can calcula te the wrong hyperspace coordinates and deliver the heroes directly into an ambush . Once the players overcome the obstacle a henchman droid has set up, the heroes can follow the leads to the ma in vil lain. Even droids that the heroes trust ca n be used as antagonists. They can be stolen, reprogrammed, and put back in service without the heroes knowing. A pilot droid might unknowingly record the location of the heroes' hideout and transmit it to an enemy. A new droid of the same type might be switched for one of the heroes' trusted allies. The enemies can hold the original droid for ransom when the heroes discover th e switch . The heroes must rescue the droid before it gives up their secret plans. ADVENTURE HOOK- MECHANIZED REVENGE The heroes have defeated a hated villain . They have gone out of their way to ensure the villain will no longer bother them. However, sometime after this ultimate defeat, signs indicate that the villain is still alive. The villain leaves cryptic audio messages for the heroes. It sets the heroes' allies on edge, perhaps kidnapping an innocent victim. When the players track their former foe back to his lair, they discover that the foe truly is dead, but a droid is attempting to take his place. The droid is still loyal to its master, and it strikes out at those who have taken its master away from it. Having watched as its master challenged the heroes in the past, the droid has learned from his mistakes. It knows every trick the heroes have up their sleeves, and it develops contingency plans. Will the droid be defeated? Or has it lured the heroes into its lair for a battle in which the droid will take its final revenge? ANTI-DROID OPINION Droids are a strange mirror for the species of the known world s. Everyone has an opinion about droids and their role in the galaxy, and many of those opin ions are unenlightened . Not everyone acts upon these dark feelings, apart from some grousing at the local cantina, but some individuals come together to make their dislike known . At times, heroes are needed to keep the peace. A common complaint about droids is that they take work away from organic beings. Some tasks, such as astrogation, can be done on ly by droids, but many droids do jobs organic beings could do. Someone who has lost a job because an employer has purchased a droid might become resentful of not on ly that particular model of droid , but of al l droids in general. When an entire work force is replaced by droid labor, public opinion can becom e very ugly, very quickly. The Worker's Militia starts in the Alagon System, after the Xeran Mining Corporation lays off its entire staff and brings in a fleet of HND-9 mining droids. The Xeran e~ecutives do not expect the disgruntled workers to resort to sabotage and destruction. A nasty uprising beaks out, and every retalia - tion raises the stakes. Workers deactivate a number of droids. Xeran forces the miners out of their corporate housing. The miners reprogram the droids to att ack ships leavi ng the system m with ore. Xeran hires bounty hunters to track down the leaders of the militia. Only intervention by the New Republic restores peace in the Alagon System, and it is an uneasy peace. The use of battle droids in the Clone Wars deals a blow to rel ations between droids and organic beings. The devastation suffered on worlds scarred by battles between the Confederacy and the Repub lic sou rs publi c sentiment for yea rs. The Empire passes regulation s barring the sale and manufacture of droids for military purp oses, even though Emperor Palpatine knows that the unease and fear caused by military droids enables the dark side to flouri sh. Some beings refuse to tolerate companies such as Arakyd profiting from the death and destruction of the Clone Wars. A rash of assassinations and accide nts tears through the ranks of these companies. The executives turn to the Emperor for help, and Emperor Palpatin e is pleased to protect them in exchange for aid in expanding his wa r machine. The Emperor wi ns on two fronts-the Empire's military grows stronger, and the escalating conflict spread by the assassi nations t urns many to t he dark side. The Unforgettab les begins as a Rebel cel l. It first strike s a majo r blow by wiping the memories of droids destined for a newly built Star Destroyer. But this group of rebellious pranksters soon turns ugly. Their leader is caught orchestrating another memory wipe and is arrested. When he is not freed, the cell beg ins a campaign to wipe the memory of any droid important to the Imperial presence in the system. The Unforgettables start with servant and protocol droids, and soon move on to starport- control droids and other droids needed by civilians. The Rebel Alli ance denounces the group's activities and begins hunting the Unforgettables as fervently as the Empire. L.OCOMOT I ON No new basic locomotion systems are presented here, but variation s and add - owns provide droid heroes with add itiona l options. Burrower Drive Min ing and other fifth-degree droids can use a burrower drive to tear through large chunks of ore embedded in the crust of a planet or in an asteroid. A burrower drive enables a droid to move at half speed underground . It can also move vertically up or down at a similar rate. A burrower drive can be used as a weapon. The droid makes a melee attack. If the attack is successfu l, the dro id deals damage equal to the amount it would do if it had used a self- destruct device. However, each successful attack moves the droid -1 step on the condition track with a persistent condition , as the drill gears and bits strip down and damage the droid. Gyroscopic Stabilizers Using g an integrated system of gyroscopes, hydraulics, and high-speed processing, this system gives a droid greater stability. The droid gains a +5 stability bonus to checks and defenses to resi st attempts to knock it prone. This bonus stacks with the bonus provided by extra legs (see page 189 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). A BATTLE OR OIO WITH AN UNDERWATER ORIVe: Underwater Drive A droid purchased on a water world such as Mon Calamari comes with an underwater drive as a standard option. The drive process is simple. The engine draws water in through the front of the drive and expels it quick ly out the back. An underwater drive gives th e droid a swim speed equa l to its base land speed. A,PPEN D AOES No new basic appendages are presented here. These accessories include on ly tho se that directly modify appendages. See "Accessories" for tools and other appendage-mounted items. Magnetic Hands Magnetic feet are a common accessory. Droids special izing in extra-vehicu lar activities are often equipped with them . Magnetic hands function like mag- netic feet. Whe n used in concert with magnetic feet, they provide a +2 bonus to any Clim b checks made while maneuver ing around a hul l in space , as well as a +5 bonus to defenses again st any attempt to knock the droid off the hul l. When magnetic hands are activated, the droid cannot make attacks or use anything requiring its hands, including weapons. Projectile Hand Fourth-degree droids are programmed for combat and security, but other droids can defend themselves as well. A popular modification is a projecti le appendage, usually a hand on humanoid droids. When the projectile is acti- vated, the hand fl ies toward the target. It is considered a nonlethal weapon. A droid might use a projectile hand in order to stu n an aggressor or knock a blaster away rather t han ri sking destru ction in a blaster f ight. The basic package is a tension-spring device that costs 250 cred its to install l. A projecti le hand is considered to be a ranged simple weapon that deals 2d8 damage. Additionally, the projecti le hand can be used to make a ranged disarm attempt again st a target wit hin 6 squares. Quick-Release Coupling Some droids require frequent changes of too ls and equipment to carry out their designated task s. A too l-sized quick-release mechanism al lows a droid (or a mechanic) to swap a tool in two standard actions: one to detach the tool and one to attach another. Both the appe ndage and the tool must have quick- re lease couplin gs. Th e appendage-sized quick re lease mechanism allo ws a droid (or a mechanic) to swap an appendage in two full-round actions: one round to detach the appendage and one round to attach another. Both the append- age and the droid cha ssis must have quick-release coupl ing s. A too l-sized quick-release coupling cannot be used with an appendage-sized cou pling. Add itiona lly, to swap out its own appendage or too l, a droid must have must have another appendage capable of carrying out the task, usually a han d or claw appendage of sufficient size, strength, and agil ity. A droid mechanic must also be capab le of handling the weight of the tool or appendage (see the Droid Accesso ri es tab les on page 58 and on page 194 of the Saga Edition core rulebook). Swapping appendages with a quick-release coup ling does not require a Mechanics check. Remote Limb Control A disassembled droid is usually not a threat. Most beings overlook a pile of droid parts on the f loor and keep moving . This package allows a droid to voluntari ly remove an arm or a hand and operate it as if it were still attached to the droid's body. This equipment comes in basic and deluxe version s. The 1500-credit basic package enables one specif ied limb to operate on its own . The limb has a small repulsor unit inside it, allow ing it to move (hover) up to 6 squares, and remains funct ional at a maximum rang e of 24 squares. While detached, the limb can perform any action it wou ld normally be able to if attached to the droid. The 6,000-cred it deluxe package enab les multipl e limbs to be active at once. A droid can control a number of limbs equal to 1 + its Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Rocket Arm This illegal modification is deri ved from the nonlethal projectile appendage security systems available for noncombat droids. A rocket arm is essentially a hol lowed-out droid arm in wh ich the servo control l has been replaced by a short-range rocket engine and fuel. The arm's f ine control is eliminated, but the droid can point its arm at a target and fire. The arm detaches and flies at the target, detonating the remaining fuel on impact. Rocket arms are unguided projectil es without targeting computers. This illegal mod if ication costs 2,000 cred its and installation requires a DC 20 Mechanics check. Failure on the Mechanics check means the rocket might not detach properly when fired, exploding and dealing its damage to the droid and all targets in a 1-square splash radius. The rocket arm is considered to be a ranged heavy weapon that deals 3d8 points of damage upon detonation , wi th a 1-square splash. PROCESSORS Processor-re lated items and accessories are presented in this section . Some of these items are used by droids, others are used on droids by other characters. Droid Remote Control An advanced version of the restraining bolt system (see page 191 of the Saga Edition core rulebookl. the droid remote control allows the owner to use a droid cal ler to move the droid using its own locomotion system. The droid cannot be compe ll ed to use any of its other systems or possession s. It simply moves as directed at one-ha lf its speed. Hidden Core The droid has a concealed back-up copy of its personal ity and the data, skills, and memories it regards as critical to its mission or operation. The copy can be concea led within the droid's main processor or be insta ll ed as a hidden secondary data sto re elsewhere within the droid. The backup restores itself 1d6 days after a memory wipe with a successfu l DC 20 Use Computer check (roll 1d20+ 10, or 1d20+ the droid's curre nt Use Computer skill modifier, whichever is greater). If unsuccessful, the core tries to restore itself aga in every 1d6 days. Discovering a hidden core requires a Use Computer check against the droid's Will Defense. The character making the Use Computer check must state that he or she is looking for a hidden core or for anything suspicious. For double the standard cost of a hidden core, the core's installer can automatically provide a Will Defense of 30 for this check. Personality Downloader Hi ghly illegal, a personality down loader is a custom-bu ilt electronic unit designed to quickly suppress an existi ng droid 's personality with a new one. Thieves, pirates, smugglers , infiltrators, and other scoundre ls occasionally use a personality down loader to take control of an enemy's droid for their own use. Using the device requires the attacker to plug the personality down- loader into one of the droid's data ports. Droids with locked access or without accessible data ports must be coaxed into comp lying. Once the personal ity down loader is attached, the user makes a Use Computer check opposed by the droid's Will Defense. If the check is successful, the personality copies itself to the droid's processor and suppresses the existing personality in 5 minutes. The process is imperfect, however. To maintain control, every 10 minutes the new personality must make another Use Computer check opposed by the orig inal personality. The invading persona lity continues to use the attacking character's Use Computer skill, even though the actual character is not actively involved after the ini tia l download is successfu l. Remote Starship Starter Scoundrels have a habit of fleeing starports with the authorities on their heels. When a captain cannot leave a crew member back at the ship, a remote starship starter comes in handy. A droid equipped with thi s rad io transmit- ter can signa l the ship to begin the preflight processes; the ship transm its preflight diagnostics back to the droid as a free action . Although the droid is not able to operate the ship remotely, having the ship prepared for departure can save the crew vita l minutes during an escape. Specialized Subprocessor Specia lized subprocessors are custom ized processing units designed to aid droids in specific tasks. Varying in size, abilities, cost, and difficulty of instal- lation, each subprocessor enables a droid to carry out a specific calculation or ana lysis more quickly or si multaneously with other tasks. A special ized subprocessor grants a droid a single extra swift action each turn that can only be used to perform an action related to a single e skil l, chosen at the time c- O I ~ 1) -i l!I D - l @ ~ @ @ (jj) @ li::: "" '\iJ ~ (lj) ~ SJ ENCOUNTERINO A DP-Z PROBE OROID Most often, a DP-2 probe droid is found performing an initial assessment of a newly discovered world, scouting ahead for its master while on a planet, or staying within line of sight of its master while it watches their camp's perimeter. In this encounter, a DP-2 probe droid patrols the edge of its master's camp in the middle of a large, grassy field on a temperate world. The droid floats along at a leisurely but steady pace at a distance of about 20 squares from the camp when the heroes arrive. When the DP-2 detects them, it alerts its master and his companions before bring- ing its blaster cannon to bear and demanding the reason for the heroes' presence. If they do not give a sufficient answer within 1 round, the droid warns them to turn back or it will open fire. If the heroes do not leave, the droid intentionally fires at the ground in front of them to try to scare them away. The DP-2 expects its master and up to three of his friends to arrive within 2 rounds to back it up. Even before the advent of t he Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War, Duwani Mechanical Products produced a vast number of droid s for man y facets of society. With a good portion of space still l unexplored, Du wani created a probe droid for the scouts and explorers that roam the galaxy. The DP-2 has an ovoid body with a face at one end and six arms that extend away at equidistant points around the middle of the chassis. Th e arm s give the droid the appearance of con sta ntly being in flight, even when it is motionl ess. The front end of the chassis hosts a highly sensitive sensor sui t e designed to scan for biological, chemical , and electromagnetic signature s as well as for vari- ous fo rms of life. The arms hold different too ls that the DP-2 uses to co ll etc samples and specimens w hen exp loring new wo rld s. In the event that the DP-2 is used to track a course or guide its master to a desti nation , it contains a space beacon system that can deploy up to 16 beacons. The droid also ca rries a blaster cannon in case it encounters host il e li f eform s during its journey. DP-2 probe droids can 't be played as droid heroes. MODIFIC A T I O N: BLOCKADE BREAKER If t he situation ever arises where one is st uck behind a planetary blockade and escape seems hopeless, thi s modifi ca tion of the DP-2 probe droid just might do the trick. The idea is to send the droid ahead to distract the blockade from noticing the ve hicle carrying those trying to esca pe. Preparing t he droid for such a task is not difficu lt and takes little more than a day. The first and probab ly most important part of the proc ess is removing the space beaco n launcher and rep lacing it with a starship-grade SR 25 shie ld generator to incre ase t he odds that the droid wi ll survive th e enco unte r. Install ing the system requir es a DC 35 Mechanics check, 4 hours of work, and raw materia ls worth 1,500 cre dits. To make sure th at suffi cient power is avai label for the shi eld gen erator, add a seco ndary batter y dedicated entire ly to that purpose (a task requiring 4 hours of work and raw mater ials worth 1,000 credits). Finally, adding maneuvering jet s he lps the droid avoid incoming fire and improves it s abil ity to successfully pilot through the blocka de; this proce ss require s 8 hours of wo rk , costs 2,000 credits, and gives the droid a +2 bonu s to its Dext erity sc ore. MODIFICATION: COURIER OROID Sometimes, cargo need s to be delivered to a recipient, but the sender wants to keep hi s or her identity secret or avoid po ss ible hosti le reactions to the package. Configuring a DP-2 probe dro id to del iver the package is a good way to accomplish such a task. To modify the DP-2 droid in this manner, sta rt by removing the space beaco n launcher and insta llin g 20 kilogram s of internal storage in it s place. Replace the droid's sublight drive with one that increases its spe ed to 4 or 5 squares to improve its chan ce of reachin g its dest in at ion in a timely manner-and to redu ce the risk that the droid w ill be sto pp ed by forces seek ing to interce pt it. Install ing a holographic image disguiser can help the droid foo l ob servers into thinking that it is nothing more than a meteor or a piece of space junk. Fin ally, adding a hyperdrive all ow s t he DP-2 to journey to oth er star systems, which furthe r helps its mast er avo id entanglements. Th e entire cost of t hi s modifi cati on is 31,300 cred its. The entire modification can be done in 2 days with a sing le DC 35 Mechanics check . Th e end result is that the droid has a su blight speed of 4 sq uares (starships sca le). a ho lographic image disg uiser, a x8 hyperdrive, and 20 kg of internal sto rage space. EXTENDED TRAVELS The DP-2 probe droid that Duwani Mechanical Products built ~ was quite popular in its day. I'm surprised they didn't put all the scouts out of business. Those droids were pretty good at what they did. I suppose that's why Duwani didn't equip them with hyperdrives. If they did that, we wouldn't need starships anymore, eh? We could just send DP-2s out to deliver our messages or find new planets for us to colonize. But I suppose that some people would still want to travel the stars, and I would be glad for that-so I could sell them some of my other droids. You know, now that you mention it, friend, there's this customer of mine who flew off to Dantooine. Something happened when he reached the system. I got a message from him saying that some droid shot out his engines when he approached one of the outer planets, and now he's drifting, caught in the planet's gravity well. The description of the droid he gave me sure sounds like a DP-2. Maybe you could go rescue him and bring him back here? He still owes me credits. ~ 0 I ) '\J .j 11l D ( J @I liJ @ @ @ @ @ lID ~ ,- I> n I ) 'lJ -l 1'1 D ~ J @ LiJ @ @ @ @ @ (iiJ ~ E5ZZ ASSASSIN OROID E522 Assassin Droid Medium droid (4th-degree) sco ut l/ soldier 6 Force 4 Init +9; Senses da rk vis ion; Perception + 10 Languages Basic, Binary Defenses Ref 24 (flat-footed 23 ), Fort 23, Wi ll 17 hp 74; Threshold 23 Immune droid traits Speed 6 squa res (tracked ) Melee unarmed +10 (ld4+7) Ranged heavy repeating blaster +7 (3dlO+3) or Ranged heavy repeating bla ster +5 (4dlO +3) with Rap id Shot or Ranged ion rifle +7 (3d8+3 ion) or Ranged ion rifle +5 (4d 8+3 ion) with Rapid Shot or Ranged mi ssil e launcher +7 (6d6+ 3) or Ranged needier gun +7 (see below) CL 7 Base Atk +6; Grp + 10 Atk Options autofire (heavy repeating blaster), Cover Fire, Devastatin g Attack (h eavy weapons), Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot Special Actions Battle Ana lysis Abilities Str 18, Dex 13, Con -, Int 11, Wis 11, Cha 12 Special Qualities droid tr aits Talents Acute Senses, Battle Analysis , Cover Fire, Devastating Attack (heavy weapons) Feats Armor Proficiency (light, medium, heavy), Point Blank Shot, Preci se Shot, Rapid Shot, Weapon Proficiency (heavy weapons , pi stols, rifles, simple weapons) Skills Initiative +9, Knowledge (tactics) +8, Perception + 10 (can rero ll), Stealth +9, Survival +8 Systems basic pro cesso r, tracked loco mot ion, 2 claw appendages, 2 too l appendages with multifun ct ion apparatus, darkvi sion , improved sensor package, locked access, vocabulato r, neutronium plating (+11 arm or) Possessions heavy repeating blaster, ion rifl e, missile launcher wit h 6 hun ter-seeker missi les, need ier gun with neurotoxin darts (treat as slug th rower rifle) Availability Military; Cost 28,535 credits Hunter-Seeker Missiles-Whe n the E522 assassin droid attacks with this weapon, the missile locks on a chose n targe t and perm its the droid to make an attack roll once per round until the missile either hit s the intended target or misses for five co nsecuti ve rounds.

The heroes spot an E522 assassin droid in the building across the street. Rushing to that structure, they see the droid as it approaches a turbolift on the far end of the building. The assassin droid turns to face the heroes and opens fire with its heavy repeating blaster. If possible, the E522 also targets with its ion rifle any droids that it sees, attempting to immobilize them. If combat lasts for more than 5 rounds, the assassin droid fires a hunter-seeker missile at one of the more troublesome heroes. If a hero closes to melee range, the droid engages that character in unarmed combat and tries to take him or her out before resuming its blaster attacks on the rest of the group. After 10 rounds of combat, the E522 assassin droid attempts to flee. c- I~' 0 I )- 1) -I 11I 1I < ILl J @ ~ @ @ @ @ @ (jj) ~ X-l VIPER OROID X-l Viper Droid Huge droid (4th-degree) non heroic 12/soldier 4 Force 1 Init + 14; Senses Perception + 14 Languages Basic (understand only)' Binary, 1 una ssigned (understand only) Defenses Ref 18 (flat-footed 17), Fort 27, Will 15 hp 110 ; Threshold 42 Immune droid traits Speed 6 squares (walking) Melee unarmed +24 (ld6+ 13) Ranged twin blaster cannon + 15 (4dlOx2 + 2) or CL 8 Ranged twin blaster cannon + 10 (6d10x2 + 2) with autofire and Burst Fire or Ranged grenade launcher + 14 (4d6+2, 2-square radius) or Ranged grenade launcher +9 (4d6+2, 2-square radiu s) and twin blaster cannon + 10 (4d10 x2 + 2) with Double Attack Fighting Space 3x3; Reach 1 square Base Atk +13; Grp +34 Atk Options Burst Fire, Double Attack, Point Blank Shot Special Actions Devastating Attack (heavy weapons), Distracting Droid, Penetrating Attack (heavy weapons) Ab ilities Str 32, Dex 12, Con -, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 8 Special Qualities droid trait s, molecular shielding Talents Devastating Attack (heavy weapons), Penetrating Attack (heavy weapons) Feats Armor Proficiency (light, medium, heavy), Burst Fire, Dist racting Droid, Double Attack, Improved Damage Threshold, Ion Shielding, Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus (heavy weapons), Weapon Proficiency (heavy weapons, pistols, rifles, simpl e weapons) Skills Initiative + 14, Jump +24, Perception + 14, Stealth -1, Survival + 14 Systems basic processor, walking locomotion, 2 claw appendages, 2 tool appendages, duranium plating (+8 armor) Possessions 2 twin blaster cannons, grenade launcher Availability Military; Cost 43,000 credits Molecular Shielding-Wh en an opponent misse s the X-1 viper droid with a ranged energy attack, the droid's molecular shielding redirects the attack back at the opponent.

It was designed by Balmorran Arms, one of the few arms manufacturers in the galaxy not to be nationalized by the Empire. Even after the formation of the New Republic, plans to build the X-1 were still in place. However, during the reborn Emperor Palpatine's bid to reconquer the galaxy, the viper droids were appropriated to serve in the Emperor's forces. Beltane, the governor of Balmorra, sought a truce with the Empire, but not before allowing a shipment of droids to be captured by New Republic commandos. The commandos deployed the X-1s on the Emperor's secret throne world of Byss and ended Palpatine's bid once and for all. X-1 vipe r droids can't be played as droid heroes. MODIFICATION: DEEP SEA DIVER The standard model X-1 viper droid can perform well in a variety of terrain t types, but its bulk usually prevents it from operat in g on worlds that are cov- ered in water. Still, the droid can be made seaworthy with a few modifications, a proc ess pioneered by Mon Calamar i engineers who altered viper droids left over from an assau lt on their homeworld .
