good on stream okay so without any further   Ado let's Ado further Mr Brian C take it away 

okayy well welcome everybody Welcome to the end   Wars game of the channel and yes this one's called 

outer rim Mysteries this happens during the period   of the Old Republic so we're going back to about 

3600 BBY if anybody understands how calendar work   

[03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=197) but that's um 3600 years before the Battle of 

yan or for easier reference for people episode   four okay and in terms of and in terms of of 

the encroaching Darkness how many years before that oh that's probably at least another I'd have to say another 25 years 

[03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=229) rough some somewhere in there I'll 

have to check with Max the exact time   the encroaching Darkness happens um 

yes this is definitely going way back fast uh oh I not get the map set the Galaxy map 

set up but anyway so any actually if anybody's   ever played Star Wars Z oldu MMO online 

this is setting we're in this is time of the basically the Republic and the 

Sith Empire the two major factions   

[04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=275) the other major faction would actually be theut 

cartel which at this time frame they are very large uh let's see we're approximately 

going to be two years after the battle   of Coran that's when corusant was attacked the 

that the Jedi Temple was stacked and basically and yes it's a period of Peace but it's not a 

restful piece there's always something going   on there's clandestin fighting happening all 

over the Galaxy between the sets and public   

[05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=321) but our main focus is going to be the outer 

rim which at this point to no one it is a very   Lawless area it's out of out of basically 

anyone's jurisdiction at the moment well   except for maybe the Huts they like 

the clean places like that that's them let's bring you guys over to this map this

little dialogue box pops up on that and   will show you what you can bend all your 

dead yeah it came up for me it says you   can improve it and stuff yeah it did come up 

yeah okay good so that's the general overall   list even shows your triumphs and spairs in there 

that's the general list it's great for just about 

[10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=623) anything uh you have your wound strength   soaked and your defense if you have it as 

far as I remember that's all automatically   taken place get into that combat second tab 

down on your right side there is equipment if   you want to roll say your weapon you want to 

click on the little picture Bame dialog pops up oh I missed 

[11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=663) and then you see well of course the little guy missed used to it yeah and of course you know if you do hit then

for how many times you've used it technically you can only use stem packs 

up to five times oh so if you've got a stem   pack that account for its uses yes okay nice 

once you've used the S pack the fifth time   you can't use them anymore and they degrade 

so the first time you use it gives you Five   Points second time gives you four third time 

gives you three they grade down unless you're   

[12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=733) a medic they get talents that actually

[12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=774) gives Force cool Power or tab down has 

all your basic information so age gender hype can finish filling that out at your leisure 

I was trying to fill it out and it was not it did   not let me change my [Music] numbers because 

I was originally looking at doing an end the   whatever they were the the four forearmed guys 

ardian and U so the height and the hair is the   wrong colors the wrong numbers or stuff but 

it it wouldn't I was trying to change it but   

[13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=810) it wouldn't let me okay we can look at that but 

it's not important I put mine in height 1.1 M eyes yellow age 16 16's a young adult for a Java the 

fifth tab down is your bibliography that's also   where you'll keep track of your experience yep 

and whether you have your obligation Duty morality   and if you have morality it also 

takes into account conflict Al   that's where your critical 

injuries will show up they 

[14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=849) happen hopefully people don't get get into 

[Music] that uh Second and L last tab will   be obligation Duty and morality that's where you 

actually put in what those are so depending on   which one you have you know you're I don't have 

any that was optional at the start right which is yeah um we haven't actually gone 

through that I haven't so we can   add that later yeah yeah we can add that 

later which should add some stuff unless   

[14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=892) you've already done it I thought I'd already 

done one but I can't remember what it was oh to find out ah you did obligation which 

is probably what we're going to go with anyway you guys are basically going to be [Music] 

fairly and then the last tab is where you can keep   track of what you spent your ah okay nice so it's 

just something you open up like a little log page   type up with spent it on just so you got an idea 

it's [Music] all that's basically a character nice   

[15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=937) [ __ ] I love Foundry I love Foundry um in chat 

especially well done found yeah big fan booys of   foundy and Dava yeah so uh on the right where the 

chap an and all the other lovely fun yeah you got   dice is at the bottom yep so if I just ask 

for like two yellow not associate anything   you just click to yellow and there's a 

button for pulling up normal d20s and   stuff as well oh no that's a calculator 

a dice tray calculator geez yeah but it   

[16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=978) will do your D4 D6 D there normal normal 

D yeah yeah cool you can also do the the   force rolls from here yes are we doing 

one for the start of the game actually wow it's a sign that's an omen we're in trouble yeah okay well that thing is uh that sheet 

is a thing of beauty that b character   

[16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1013) sheep [Music] one dark yeah so just roll 

one yellow Dice and let's figure out what we got are we actually rolling light 

side and dark side are we for yeah   that's part of the game yep just 

one for stce yeah just one for stce y one L we get to spin 

those dice yeah [Music] and one oh look at the little counter bottom 

right guys M MH that's cool that's what I'm   

[17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1062) look for uh the other way we could do it is I 

can just have that show up in chat cck here to   roll for the destiny pool so we just click on it 

oh nice yeah and it would actually automatically   populate it so care you guys already rolled 

it I've set it up so to be careful don't just   spend 3 hours gushing over how much I love Foundry 

tonight by the way cuz this is this is a thing of beauty and then of course the 

buttons look a little different   

[18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1091) here as in say if you play in D 

and D or that on found you got   for public rols and private GM rolls 

just going along the top there did sweet that that's the basic slow down um pretty 

intuitive so let's get point where you guys must land of course I believe everybody sees a black   screen yes at the moment okay 

time to move some tokens on 

[19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1140) now hopefully this works I preset all the tokens so don't like that I lost oh that's [Music] why our our poor soier medic 

lost his L what I set up as a token just take care of that and just make sure that is up right MOS ETA 

is that where we are yes strong the planet of Mo   

[19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1198) well you're on Tatooine on a little Outpost 

called MOS T within my home planet yeah we're   we're on a planet that ja's come from the 

the holy land this the best planet in the   galaxy Bo you realize we're only having 

to start there cuz they don't let you off   no we're starting here cuz I'll no let you 

back in once we get rid of you non Jawa scum humans humans gun it's Sandy and the 

sand gets everywhere I don't like 

[20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1237) sand soft you big races you tall races 

you're all soft now can everybody sort of   see around them now yeah yes okay 

yeah this is cool this is super cool so so you're Landing just as to sunet it's not quite 100% [Music] dark and the building in 

front of you is the [Music] actual 

[21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1277) face yeah we'll call it facep 

that yeah probably like Center uh you guys have already clear custom not a big deal what so let's have a little talk about 

what are you guys actually doing for a living you got this ship uh the third the fourth 

player is actually playing a Mandalorian Bounty   Hunter when um good Max can yeah session well 

I'm easy this is my home planet um but I am a   

[22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1332) Smuggler and a thief at that so I'm going 

out for a big score I'm heading off Planet   maybe even for the first time I've maybe even 

never even left my home planet Tatooine this is   maybe the first time so I've joined up with 

a crew to go and make my fortune somewhere   where it's a bit more than just stealing scrap uh what the others well it's uh kind of 

hard to stay in a military organization when   

[22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1367) you get into a fight with one of your superiors 

and he loses yes that will do it that normally   get sent to the worst part of the Galaxy and 

so looking for work I got picked up along the way um and uh my Gand is a slicer so uh 

packs into computer systems for a living   gets information sells information refers to 

avoid any entanglements had a couple of run   in the past so kind of looking over my 

[23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1411) shoulder sounds happened to go into a 

couple of computers that people weren't   very happy with me puddling around in 

so you know maybe pissed off a Hut or   two best be on the move a Gand got to

[24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1450) ja figure spe there's a whole bunch of stuff 

sitting around here that's not nailed down oh   it won't be there for long do not sell our ship no

something to do at the moment well you're you're sitting in the outer rent probably all just the way you describe 

it you all sort of just met up here like 

[28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1694) hey we got a STP actually who 

actually had piloting what's your   what's your pilot un like with this character Dave almost as good as my other one two green 

I don't think I've got anything in pil   to be honest not trained but I have I 

have an agility of three so I've got   an agility of three that means that the 

ship actually belongs to the Mandalorian   

[28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1729) he could actually pilot it since Max ship 

okay yeah so we're going to say that um B through to accompany him on 

his adventures uh what happened   to his previous crew don't know 

that's Mandan for you you [Music] don't but he basically says you know we're 

not going to take off for a couple days he's   you know got to get some PR wise and he's 

checking with his contacts on what there   

[29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1771) might be available out there so okay so if we're 

just hanging around with this little outpost on   yeah you're just hanging around right now I 

guess sniff around at the bar and listen for   rumors for work and stuff then maybe about 

any little sneaky jobs like a big score or something was that the computer the bar was that 

up here I saw a bar any of them labeled or listed   as the bar okay the one up here is actually a bunk 

house where you can pay for like sleep the night   

[30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1820) bar is actually down here [ __ ] where's the bar 

down here okay that's where I'm going to the bar I mean that's the first place you go in any 

Adventure right we all all good Adventure start at   a [Music] bar yeah I'm going to I'm going to stop 

for a little drinky poo at the bar then I don't   have any money I'm going to pick pick somebody's 

pocket and then have a little drink [Music]   ooh ooh a bar this an actual bar yes Brian Who 

would know there's a bar inside the bar there's   

[31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=1873) the bar right so first I go around just talk to

[36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2175) that's what that's your Race 3 wow 

that's not what I actually looked   like that's what my suit looks like 

yes oh that's a suit so that's actually okay cool they need to actually wear a respirator 

do they not breathe normal oxygen they do not   breathe normal oxygen I believe it's 

ammonia type atmosphere they come from   

[36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2209) also Jawa don't speak common no so you have to 

be able to speak Java to communicate with me   guys understand belt around the back of the 

head or we need a communicator chip or a be   Droid or something the Java languages uh change 

as people try to figure it out so there is no   speaking Java yeah that's right so communicate 

with you guys what do I need I need like a   little you understand common you understand galac 

I understand it Galactic common but I can't speak   

[37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2247) it cuz my tongue my vocal cords are 

different I think you just you just   keep going just you around the back of 

the head until you stop licking stuff yeah so here here's a a good opportunity 

looks like you guys probably need at   least protocol Droid protocol Droid yeah uh and 

it's that a hire thing or a buy thing [Music]   um well it could it could be a steel thing I 

suppose or it could be a override some security   

[38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2291) thing yeah good thinking that yeah yeah I like 

the way you think I like you already what about   we steal ourselves propal droids so we've got 

a translator find one with a find one with a   restraining B override the restraining bolt but 

on our own restraining bolts are good well also   like if you take off the restrain bolt it might 

be grateful enough to say yeah it might be yeah   might be happy with this especially if they're 

basically abused yeah if we find one that's not 

[38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2329) happy right and find one with 

um some uh whose owner is a Jawa oh yes yeah that be perfect from one 

Jawa to another and now this is my whole   planet and he would also speak ja is part 

also this is my whole planet I a race of   n good well robot abusers I I might know 

where wait I might know just know where   somebody's got one of them and how to get 

into the back yard to get cuz my uncle or   

[39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2368) something might have do you know what I 

mean I might know the exact whereabouts   of one of those on my home planet what do 

you think Brian yeah that's a possibility um so first first first jobs a heist 

we're going to steal a protocol Droid   Bo [Music] yeah okay so [Music] um one drink 

and we're stealing stuff already I love it   yeah [Music] perfect okay uh K just give me a two 

green Roll Just a two a two green roll just two   

[40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2409) green okay that's a success and an advantage 

so as you're sitting in the bar here you're   drinking and you're disgusting you hear one of 

the people close to the bar talking about how   there's a a jawwa sand crawler should be showing 

up in the day and they're hoping that that you know supposedly they have Droids on board for sale 

did you see it was coming in today think yeah so   like the next day yep or tomorrow right okay and 

he's like yeah I really I really need I need a   

[40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2459) couple new ones replace ones that broke down at 

the water Farm moistu the moisture Collective farm so yeah probably should be here like when the 

sun's suns are their highest round noon so okay so   we know that and then they just start ning ning 

about other stuff you know the moisture farm and   how it's actually been doing pretty profitable 

on that okay the those guys talking about you   know that makes the miners really happy you 

know especially if they got water and drying 

[41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2501) mines well once I earshot of them I'll tell 

the boys that I know someone who's well just   heard about someone who's needing a couple of 

brand new droids I know who's buying them and   where they're going to be bought to so 

where exactly it take them from also we   could depends on when when the when that 

Jaa sand crawler comes in we could have   a pick of him from there but I think the 

easier option is wait till this guy buyes   

[42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2532) cuz he said he was need a couple of droids 

wait till this guy buys his two droids gets   them back to it was the water treatment uh 

the moisture collect yeah the moisture Farm   the moisture Farm we could even Ambush the 

guy on the way back a few ways we could do that what do you think and then we could if 

we Nick them both we can sell the other one   back to the Jers of extra coin and 

I'll get you a special price cuz of 

[42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2568) Jers it's like you guys are coming up with a plan 

which means they won't steal your shoelaces while   we do the sale and they probably will as well 

no no oh I'll put a special claw in that they don't oh yeah so yeah so that that's yeah you 

know most of the talk throughout the night is   about the moisture farm and wies that are and 

the Jawa crawler that's going so the Jawa sand   crawlers is expected when the suns are at their 

highest we could follow this guy after he buys   

[43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2611) his new droids follow him I [Music] think 

is it worth um following him tonight find   out where he lives well I know where the we 

know where the moisture Farm is don't we yeah   you got a good idea where it is so that's 

not a problem it's my home planet I would know so sh I just a few more drinks then we knock   off 50 credits for another couple 

of rounds then just to pass the 

[44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2642) time what you think blame yeah 

we should probably see about uh   putting uh finding out if we if we 

can't rent some sort of a speeder hauler yeah something R still okay   that could be our second thing on the on the 

invent see we don't want to be getting ourselves   into too much trouble yeah we steal yeah but 

you're dealing with a dra here we we steal the   

[44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2679) one thing here in T and then we go somewhere else 

to steal the next thing so I say here on the not   a good idea skip uh because we are going to need 

something like a speeder but I think if we can   get our protocol Droid from here skip down off 

into Spacey we go and then then somewhere else   and then grab ourselves a speeder or two I think 

that could be a good second item on the shopping list protocol Droid first though cuz we 

can't actually talk to each other at the 

[45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2711) moment I'm writing it down I suppose I could 

write Common if I can understand Galactic   common and I have hands I can write it just 

don't have the vocal cords for it right right   I mean you you we we might know certain phrases 

that you choose to to use for things yeah or you   can point to stuff yeah and I'll have a little 

data pad and I can draw things and but I think   a protocol Droid would be better so that we can 

actually speak yes definitely would help Jawas   

[45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2744) have been known to D to drive Pro protocol 

droids crazy because their language just re   just randomly evolves yeah would be useful 

for all sorts yeah yep it can be quite quite useful he let's mug that pure moisture 

farmer yeah I feel I almost feel bad for him almost on or maybe it's not it 

wasn't his choice you don't 

[46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2779) know everybody wants to live 

on tattoo what you on about got beaches for days sand here the beaches are 

beautiful it's an oasis Planet he just never   actually get to the coast yeah or any water or 

any water who needs water who needs water when   you got this much sand beautiful beautiful sand 

yeah little weird nothing wrong with um just when   can't make sand castles I mean I think 

guess the night goes on a bit how long   

[47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2820) are we waiting until we need to is it 

a few hours Brian or like half a day or um well by the guys got here and 

heard everything it'd be about 9 and the Joan crawler with the the droids for 

sales expected to round when whens the high   noon so it's tomorrow it's not soon yeah 

okay should we retire to the ship for the   night then yeah I'm going to go and try and 

make friends with the computer I think on   

[47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2858) the ship I'm going to familiarize myself 

with the ship as well as in unscrew a load   of things and put up put the other things 

where they should be and mess around with it uh tinker I'm gonna Tinker gonna Tinker 

just make sure you don't Tinker with like us   be being able to leave when we need to no 

no no no I just like I've got a taste for   coffee I'll be putting in a coffee machine 

and stuff it runs in the family a taste for 

[48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2894) coffee we'll come back and half the ship will be missing that that almost happened in one of my   one of the campaigns I ran 

they left the ship to a to a jawwa you cannot trust him as far as he can 

throw him so I decided because I played a   Jawa in the other game and I really wanted to 

play a Jawa again decided that this Jawa Krick   

[48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2926) would be the ancestor of Click from the other 

game so it's great great great grandfather or whatever just for a they're all don't you 

just for a little continuity and cannon   in the RX Oliver Universe yes that's always 

a good thing yeah why not they all have an   uncle Krick in the in the line somewhere mhm 

Yes somewhere okay right Brian I think we're   going to head to the ship for the rest 

of the night then excuse me excuse me 

[49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=2970) [Music] oh this map what a thing of be out this far without breaking anything I was 

thinking about picking another pocket before   we go but I almost got caught the first 

time so I'm going to push my luck like ask C familiarizing himself 

with the computer making friends or yeah see if I can have a dig into 

um get myself a nice little back door   

[50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3026) into it here let's get oh we've got actual 

to actual map the ship that's pretty cool yeah H medical Bay you going to check the stocks of 

the medical Bay yeah let me read the   thing laser cannons thrusters Bridge nav 

computer Captain's Quarters that's where   Ashley obviously conference room cargo 

hold crew quarters that's where the rest   

[51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3061) of you sleep engine room medical Bay Escape 

pod that's where I go and [ __ ] goes west   and you guys are all dying boarding ramp so 

I'm going to be dying laughing when he tries   to go into the Captain's Quarters and the 

Mandalorian just picks him up and Chucks him yeah yeah so if you're watching we supposed 

to be four of us tonight are good friend Max   is playing a Mandalorian he has with us as 

an NPC at the moment and it's his ship so   

[51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3092) I'm not really going in the Captain's 

Quarters P access nice so what's the   crew quarters is number eight yep okay 

yes I'm going to head there familiarize   see what the coffee machine's like 

improve it if it's not to my taste [Music] oh there I am right yeah that's 

[52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3125) me okay [Music] just just getting things ready 

for the VAC scine yep I W get I love this map so good so Brian I'm going to be taking a look 

at the stocks and stores and making sure   

[53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3183) that um anything that we need I I keep a 

running list of yeah I'll probably drop   some of my extra stuff here too oh yeah 

I know I've got a couple of extra well   I've got the well I'll probably keep 

the trauma pack with me um [Music] and I will have a actual for you 

guys [Music] now that's just one   thing I have to still figure out 

how to set out no stress mate no 

[53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3229) stress but so in the in the movie World um Baka was the 

thing but in this world in the Old Republic it was   something else yes um did basically the same thing 

but it wasn't maybe quite as potent or was just a   different formulation or whatever yeah yeah it's 

one of those things that over time gradually got better but right now for the uh the 

stake of ease we'll just say it is 

[54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3276) Baka yes um so there nothing besides walking 

around inside [ __ ] I did hear um Dave you're GNA talk to the ship's computer 

yeah I make friends with it see if I can get   a nice back door into it find out what our 

illustrous captain has been up to who is actually   working for what his plans are if I can rig the 

Hol de the hollow in my favor ah going for the fun 

[55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3338) stuff make uh let make the de table loose to me 

but absolutely B hard for everybody else so I look good ah it's point like a true slicer uh but yeah yeah I want to um see if our Captain's   hiding anything from us okay give me a 

computer check it's going to be three purple so that's just how to do I just click 

on there we go did I mention I love Foundry 

[56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3388) oh me I I'll never stop saying that I love found 

too like okay so you actually are able to get   in a bit into the system I say it's early days 

you know we're just flirting at the moment yeah   um he's not working for anyone in particular 

but he does take a lot of contracts from the Huts we're on tatto that's pretty 

much all that there is around here   so uh makes sense I guess um 

there are some encrypted files 

[57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3428) oh would take a bit of work to get into I 

mean plenty of time um might but um you a   couple of them just to work on but you can 

get into the game console um RS to break it   for you yeah marvelous so that's so when we 

play games on it it's [ __ ] hard for us yeah yeah I just punch it see it oh yeah I'll I'll 

just once I've like got a relationship with it   I'll just um any sort of spare time I have on the 

ship I'll just work on digging a bit further in   

[57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3476) and uh keep going at these encrypted files rolling   private dice already [Music] 

boys got to keep this on your toes um you also do find one 

data file that not encrypted   that probably should have been uhoh [Music] and it's the actual registry 

of the original owner of the 

[58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3513) ship oh me more uh the original 

owner's name was lonard Turin lard talking [Music] is this a name I've come across at all no 

in that case that's a name that I'll uh be looking up might not be able to find anything on him 

in uh this particular Backwater I'm guessing   but um yeah I'm going to keep my ears to 

the ground on that particular name okay 

[59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3566) so if there's nothing really thing 

else going to move on to the next day okay and of course it's a fairly Sandy it's it's yeah it's like 

where you're going to be meeting this   just outside of town not going to be a big issue [Music] 

[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3602) [Music]   maybe we can scout it and see 

if we can find a good place to we could Scout the route between where the the 

sand crawler stops and the the moisture Farm Scout   that route find a nice spot okay so you're 

scouting that spot just to see are you guys   actually going to go back to the sand crawler 

or not I don't think we need to go to the sand   

[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3637) crawler if we just check out the route between the 

sand crawler and his place and find the best place   to yeah to do him okay so you do find a nice place 

um nice El Cropper rocks to hide behind while   you're doing this in sort of getting ready I need 

everybody to give me a perception it's going to be purple and the black [Music] 

ooh don't like the sound of that just need the G can there we 

[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3687) go so skip that threat one point of strain 

your sir look around but you guys do notice   there is smoke rising in the background 

from roughly where the crawler should be uhoh [Laughter] yeah yeah I see it I see it I see it whack by the 

[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3724) [Music] can do you happen 

to have some binoculars with you I bought two things in my inventory I spent 

all my money on a gun and a a vest I don't have   binoculars in my yeah I think [Music] cat [Music] 

stream it would be nice to say there was a pair of   on the ship there's a pair on the ship okay there 

was a pair on the ship uh let's see I borrowed our   Mandalorian friends one yeah he like borrowed 

yeah yeah here's my binoculars you can use them   

[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3770) here's my binoculars yeah yeah give remember give 

me them back those are mine those are expensive um yeah so I guess we can try to take a better 

look um I'll can't does that give us I can't   help thinking the um inocular would probably 

better used by somebody that can actually talk yeah um yeah you know I'll hand them over 

like uh may I don't have the greatest perception r   better than someone that better on 

someone that's more than 1 M tall as 

[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3809) well like you guys can see better than you 

you guys see like two miles further on the   horizon a four perception is a pretty 

darn good perception I I'll just like   the binoculars up to like one of my eyes 

and the other ey okay the first one again   my perception is four green it's not bad like 

yeah yours is not bad so who's ever going to   roll it perception but this time you get a 

blue perception with a blue right I'll roll   

[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3845) that then hopefully we can see a little bit more 

detail perception and add a blue add a blue okay failed the way around mate yeah there's 

no push rolls in this game push the roll   as and I turn I turn the BR Killers the right 

way around no again pops you upside the head again a handed bro to someone [Music] 

else you have to turn them [Laughter] on y I've only got back can hand the B to someone 

else while Oliver goes to the fridge yeah I   

[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3895) will try I don't know that it will help 

but I will try get a blue I got a bunch of advantages um a double fail God oh did they 

fail yeah you don't see anything you could   definitely spend one of those advantages 

to get rid of a string one string you got right SP and then if the G wants to try 

you could give him a blue dice on top of I   SP Mr big guy apparently we're getting a lot of 

failures on these right now it's the binocular   

[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3942) are fault so two purple and a blue yeah lost my 

perception two purple and two blue two it's like   I got it dialed in but I don't know something's 

not working right come on Oh my days we got we   have found our level you really can't see what 

it is we're going to move closer and see if that   doesn't help I'm the ridge we just like behind 

a ridge and we're like can't see over it I I'll   grab the binoculars again and I'll like quickly 

climb up onto somebody's shoulders who's taller   

[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=3979) what's like what's toer a Gand or a human you 

see um a human I'll climb up on the human should   can I climb up with the human shoulders have 

another go Brian okay come on we can't just   fail and fail and fail let's get body trained 

right right and what what am I getting a blue   you can have two Blues we'll save couple of 

those [Music] aveng here we go oh that's what   you needed you needed some height elevation to 

see what was and you can see the sand crawler   

[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4020) and it think that's actually smoking should we go 

res the robots on the S should we go rescue some drones go liberate some some drones guys yeah 

we might we might P yeah might we might get   an extra couple here we might get make a we 

profit here looking around do I see people   Scavenging do I see people crawling in out 

survivors crawling out from a wreck does it   look like a crash does it look like it's 

been shot up what can I perceive it looks   

[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4053) like it's been shot up and is there still 

people around that shooting at it is there   people moving away from it with stuff what 

else do I see um as you get closer give me a map oo there it is the big J sand [Music] crawler all right so if you want 

you can give me another perception 

[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4107) just using my eyes someone else 

can use the okay yes who's ever   using the binoculars can get a blue okay oh man I'm looking at the smoke small it six six 

successes for me with binoculars he W okay you   because you're using binoculars you actually can 

see there's that base in the middle between the tracks [Music] mhm be just 

on the other side there's a   

[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4150) bunch of Imperial Troopers Imperial 

Troopers o as in like Sith yeah EMP [Music] I've got a new plan let's find some 

droids somewhere else lots of Droids on this   planet how many we could wait it out and 

see what they do see if they're just here   checking up on it they might not be here for 

long they might bugger off we could wait it   out should we just kind of lie low for a minute 

and see there's that big rock right over here   

[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4195) yeah should we lie low behind the rock jents 

yeah I like that idea just going of give them a   observe see if they do anything just um make 

sure you're not seen because they will kick   seven shades of snot out of us yes I think 

they will we don't have the mandalorean with us sure those guys are probably 

uh pick the Mandalorian as well   possibly but he would have been our 

only chance always private rolling dice 

[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4233) boys actually should I didn't hear the last part no 

I sorry I have a bad habit of talking so that's [ __ ] okay so far it looks like you have 

not been spotted hey okay and what   are these yeah what are these Empire 

forces doing [Music] um they have a   

[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4275) vehicle with them I don't see 

a vehicle at least not around and it's not like they'd be wandering out in 

desert without something probably means they'   been dropped off by ship we need to be keeping 

an eye out then make sure that people aren't   something doesn't coming up on behind us yeah 

yeah should we wait it out but though see see   what come see if something comes for yeah but you 

see well we're kind of stuck here to be honest you   

[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4315) see them start to walk away and they have about 

seven jaas basically in cffs in cuffs yeah you   know I knew I like these guys they did take all 

the Jaws away KCK is but how Oliver feels about   that well KCK feels very angry that his kin are 

being taken away by the evil empire but also   thinks more loot for me on that sand crawler if 

that's seven of them are not getting any I means   I'm getting all theirs it's the Jaa we thinking 

per weighing the op say my [Music] friends friends   

[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4362) BL I mean I never said they were my friends 

you said they were jaas I never said they're   probably related yeah somehow yeah there will be 

but like askot said we are not taking on three   Imperial Troopers the three of us is that all of 

them is that all the Imperials that as all the   Imperials there is now that you got a better 

look it's one officer and there's eight cards   eight yes oh we definitely can't try and take the 

more free the the Jawa name come here I think I   

[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4402) mean this sand crawler isn't going anywhere M no 

oh it's not going let's watch and see if they do   so I think I think we give them plenty of time to 

leave the area agreed I mean there's nothing we   could do even if we wanted to and we do them 

so even if we wanted to do the right thing   and rescue those Jaa we couldn't we wouldn't 

have a chance yeah and and to be fair I'm sure   they have done something I they probably stole 

something to be fair but still the evil empire 

[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4438) they almost certainly deserve to 

be in cops yeah but not by the evil empire Republic any better 

I mean how dare they try to steal it's it's their nature they can't help it 

uh so yeah I I re and they they they eventually   wander off they eventually just wander off hker 

down yeah they off with their C we yeah so we   yeah ask off wait an hour maybe have some lunch 

make sure that there aren't any ships flying   

[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4479) around but keep an eye out in case anybody else 

comes to scavenge though we'll keep an Eagle Eye   in case somebody else comes to scavenge but 

we'll take a little break just to make sure   yeah you're right give them some time make 

sure they're gone definitely gone mhm mhm   no don't want them coming back and then 

yeah in and pick up the pieces an hour   passes nobody else shows up you do see an 

imperial shuttle take off in the distance   

[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4511) but it's going the opposite direction oh I think 

that's that's our que Lads is our que to do some stealing I've got a feeling 

we're going to do some Ste hey Foundry have I told you today that I 

love you come to the rescue as it's also   known yeah come to the we're going to liberate 

some droids yeah liberate yeah and any shable   equipment get around there there are 

some dead Jas on the ground and that   

[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4555) person that was going to buy some droids he's also 

dead on oh oh no oh no I bet empty [Music] it you   liberated his wallet at least I will liberate 

his wallet yes was he plan on paying forid um   you find on him 500 wow 500 credits was it 

just Jawas that were taken away or did the   Imperial stationid as well okay is the ship 

open or is the ship closed no it's open guess   we go exploring yeah um is there going to be 

a computer on this um sand crawler yes sir I'm   

[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4609) just uh thinking of uh if we could see where 

these jws have been recently what might have um Imperial interest so you get inside the main hole and do find a lot of destroyed 

droids destroyed ones it's almost like it's almost like they tucked in a bunch 

of thermal de inside the Carle o okay so it's   

[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4651) going to be a good scavenger right to see if any 

of them are not destroyed then I guess yeah got   Grant you there is other stuff all through here 

like large containers and all that not all of   them have been destroyed and you might find 

a Droid or two behind them that got shielded   okay can I yeah we'll do a search yeah can we 

do that then everybody do a search um it'll be go ah two purple and two black perception 

well I'm going to let these two clowns um do   

[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4696) the searching um actually search try and 

get into a computer um let me see where   is search search a thing yeah I was thinking 

it's vigilance but I don't see SE I don't see search StreetWise I'm probably thinking 

the wrong you think you might be thinking   it down system M there is no sh yeah I'm 

thinking something completely different   yeah so it would be a percept you could 

do either perception or vigil perception   

[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4727) or vigilance whatever's better two black yes 

two purple two black two purple and two black fail from skip big three successes in a threat 

from KCK though okay so the threat will just be   one strain okay and strain is here just add that 

manually don't you yeah yep cool well I had a   failure but I had an advantage okay well the the 

advantage is if you find one undetonated thermal Deton nice yep so failure as it goes off in 

your hand I will secure I will secure safe   

[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4778) secure it secure it safely yeah um can I add 

that to my character sheet yes you can and it   should be in the equipment compendium 

equipment compendium items yeah yeah actually would be under like I'm not seeing anything 

in there right now let's see thermal rollable tables 

cards playlist pendium packs 

[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4830) and while he's finding it I've got three successes I did not find anything I didn't pull 

anything up no there I found it for you I'll put   it on your sheet appreciate it yes your three 

successes find a PA you find a pair of droids   nice um they're not powered on at the moment 

one is a protocol Droid the other one is an   astrom a what an Astromech astrom so describe to 

me what that is then yeah it's your qu Central oh   

[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4871) an astro make so it's the mechanic it goes 

around the ship and fixes it helps the fly to Okay so we've got rd2 sty one and 

a and because he's a that's a protocol   Droid right yeah essentially yes okay we will 

be liberating those droids boys liberating I   just dropped thermal detonator into your sheet 

careful careful how hard you drop that um as   you notice it's in red it means it's an actually 

restricted item the Aver person should be walking   

[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4912) around it'll go in the bottom of my medical 

bag do Brian do these Droids have names C and R2D2 so yeah you find them they do have 

restrain BS on do they have um names these   Droids like Cal number names um like 

they they they will three two droids up this is for my paper I have to make up 

the two droids so I haven't yes right make   them up later then don't worry yeah I'll make 

them up but I also got to see how they did the   

[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4962) naming in this time period again okay 

it is slightly but we have a protocol   and an astral Mech Droid so we take off the 

restraining bolts then no no no no no no no   oh you have to do the thing first yeah he 

actually you're a jav you might know how   to take a restraining Bol off having said 

that but if you take the restraining Bol   off they might [ __ ] off yeah Mech has 

a bit of an attitude its name is R4 Fu R4 

[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=4993) Fu it is Canon now I'm writing it down 

it's Canon okay he I guess we're sticking   with it he's got an attitude problem his 

name is R4 Fu I like it nice one even if   it isn't that's just new name now so 

I know it's Canon now I've wrot it down so you were slicing into the computer 

there yeah just interested to see where   these Javas had been to um upset the Imperials 

okay give me a computer's chat it's going to 

[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5041) be it'll be four purple because you don't 

understand Jaan do I get any bonuses for   Can I with then slicing that will give 

you a loot and if trick helps it will be another so four purple two blue right 

go come on on loads of dice loads of   dice nothing loads of failures well two 

failures it's like it just doesn't speak   your language man yeah you just can't figure 

it out but you are able to actually download a 

[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5095) manifest three advantages that's nice if you can just figure out how to read 

it it'll tell you exactly what was on this   crawler um well I have a jawwa and I have a 

protocol Droid yes you do can I TR it then   um do I need to um in with the restraining 

bolt to basically bring the droids under   our control yeah you'd have to check her with 

that um that case that's uh our next plan I 

[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5135) think yeah I'll uh I'll see if I can um sort the 

droids out okay do we do we want to liberate them   and make friends with them or do we want to 

enslave them I want to try and make friends   with them if we can hopefully we can be better 

Masters or owners than the last ones they they   had hopefully you want Happy droids happy Droid 

for hard working Droid that's right yeah I'll   see if I can uh I'll I'll might not understand 

these restraining bols that well I'll do the   

[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5174) um Astromech first just in case it GES hits 

up so it be on the as okay it be three purple is this computers computers or mechanic either one whichever is better at three 

purple did you say yes three purple ah on six purple at one point let's try that again 

[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5216) come on come on decent R please there 

you go yeah you're actually to not   only remove the restraining bolt 

but you can now actually reapply   it to someone else if you want 

you didn't destroy it like on my equipment k350 for the for the protocol 

Droid is that yeah that'd be queso queso it's actually like a like a creamish 

yellow color with red red and green um spots   

[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5258) got you got you got you right okay so 

the BR C Droid is called K A castian accent yes yes I love it yeah man okay K 350 oh you want to work on   that restrain on the protocol dry yes 

please that's why he give yourself a blue on a 

[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5304) Triumph this is our new best [Laughter] friend and   the minute the restraining bolt comes off 

he actually turns on oh and he's like hello   there [Music] hello where are those 

joah it's fine he's not too bad for a ja I don't care what you say I don't trust 

you that is quite that is quite reasonable   but we're keeping an eye on him nobody 

trusts him is a ja obviously he's one of 

[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5353) the and the only and the only smells a little bit I'll just smacking around the back 

of the head again I I take it you're   not Imperials are you no no no they just 

left we came here to um to liberate what   we could they took the jaras away 

so uh you're not I think it's just uh we're independent Traders 

independently minded ah so you're   

[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5394) alive with the Huts more independently 

minded more independently minded than that we're not really aligned with anybody 

other than ourselves but you know we go where   the work is people for hire I understand 

yes unfortunately I think uh it's just you   and uh your little friend here are the only um 

survivors of the Imperial attack I don't know if   you remember anything that happened or if you were 

um under restraint oh those these little kept me 

[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5436) restrained and my power off rat bags well I could use more colorful 

language but seems to be other people   here I will keep it to myself it's quite 

all right feel free fre to uh voice your   opinions you're with You're With Friends 

well people you've met oh removing that   thing definitely situation towards friendship 

doesn't it you're doing good work there the   

[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5470) droids a little bit I certainly hope so um 

you you are a free Droid but if you would   like to um come with us out of this hell 

pit of a planet um I'm sure we can find that would be nice and uh yeah everybody can 

always uh use a protocol Droid in the astrom how do I get 

[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5539) how do I find the restraining bolt on uh 

you actually it pop off perfectly on him   um you just didn't turn on yeah I can type 

it in are you adding it to your equipment   it's restain B yeah D straight yeah I found 

it so I will throw it on there for you you're   adding it to your equipment so you can keep 

a hold of it I've got you I've got you that's   see what you're doing so if we come across 

any um other droids droids then um yeah we   

[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5585) can slap it on obviously I wouldn't dream of 

using it on our two friends here but uh if   we come across any um Imperial Droids that are 

giving us trouble might come in handy it just F but um yeah well if you if you wouldn't 

mind uh I've downloaded the Manifest um   from this scrap pile but it's it's in 

Jaa uh he can read it but he can't talk   because he a Java so I don't know if you 

can read ja or translate for the um for   

[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5625) our ridot friend I can easily translate 

this if you don't mind I'll a look at it pass he looks at it and like it's just 

growing fast like a blur as it grow like oh oh any idea why the Imperials were so I mean they   AR normally going to uh bother a 

Jaa sand crawler way below them and he looks around at some 

the larger crate it's like 

[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5671) oh they didn't find it they didn't find what turns out there's a there's a proton torpedo launcher on board 

hey what now a ship yes the ship version of a   ship proton torpedo launcher what the hell were 

jaas doing with a proton torpedo launcher and   they've not found it scavenge it scavenged 

it off an imperial ship [Music] crashed and   

[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5716) theyve not found it that means we can find it 

yes yeah it does there should be a crate behind   near it and he gives you the serial number that 

should have eight proton torpedoes in it thank   goodness those didn't blow up yeah oh those 

blew up there would be no sand crawler right   so gentlemen we are definitely steing do some more 

uh perception checks here yeah uh yes and because   he gave you the serial number that you're supposed 

to look for it's only going to be two purple 

[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5761) sweet I'm going to be vigilant I'm going 

to actually start looking around outside   now knowing now what they were expecting to 

find I'm going to go do vigilance I still failed so what do I need to go look outside um 

if you're doing vigilance three purple three   purple all right because I'm going outside and 

looking around and making sure we're not getting a uh question for you Brian he's got success but 

question for you Brian being a professional   

[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5803) Thief that I am can I use skull Duggy when 

looking for things instead of perception so   I'm looking around in in like for actually yes 

you can use skull yes come on I've got a nice   roll in that and it's just there let's go oh 

look at all those advantages there you go yes   you do find the crate in it's D nice and did you 

say with eight Torpedoes as well eight Torpedoes   oh this is going to nice on the ship boys our 

only challenge is getting this does it have 

[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5848) advantages does it have an autoloader with it 

uh no it doesn't but with those four advantages   you noticed out of the corner of your eye there's 

something that has a tarp p a tarp off it's a land   speeder oh boys and it has not been Dam it so we 

can load these things up are these anti-grav cargo   or is this going to be yes they an gra cargo 

so we just use the crate and the crate just   toes behind the the speeder it just goes onto the 

yeah or goes onto the loader yeah there we go boys   

[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5894) boys boys now speed a speeder will take two human 

size plus a Java right on thep this one actually   four people oh yeah two droids too the two 

droids can actually be attached to the back   so what did you say Brian four humanized people 

yes so how so how many are we we're we're three   a protocol Droid which can take a seat so 

we can all we can all get on that speeder   and then put the the the Astromech into 

the Droid pod the Jaa yeah into the yeah   

[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5934) and put the jawwa on the other side nope yeah 

hanging off the wheels at the bottom no let me in nice that was a good score that is a good 

score boys we got a speeder a proton torpedo   launcher and eight Torpedoes for the ship 

suggest we bring it in after yeah let's bring   that in after dark and the sneakiest we need to 

move this away from where we're at yeah right   Bri I want to know about the sneakiest back 

like alest way back into that settlement and   

[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=5971) again would would I be asking for skull 

duggery to try and find that well what we   can probably do is hide this somewhere 

and then just come and pick it up our ship right rather than trying to smuggle a 

proton torpedo launcher into town into town right   okay that's what I'll do then Brian good thinking 

Dave so I'm going to roll for skill dugy to find   a good hiding place for this somewhere between 

here and town how's that Ryan okay um that will 

[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6005) be settle the land speeder 

down cover it I'm going upgrade red so it's skull dogy uh 

with a red one red two purple   okay can I use a light side spending any um 

Light Side just click on it yeah just click   on light side there you go okay let's go 

this is to find a nice hiding place for the stuff not bad do find a hiding 

place it's a bit of a tight fit but   

[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6053) can actually get them in there nice 

should we hide these for the night or   until like the middle of the night and then 

we come back out and get get chance to yeah yeah nice one so we're heading back to 

the ship then that's a good score go [ __ ] two new friends yes you have your two new friends 

[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6091) there nice day now try to get that the asch up and running on 

the ship that would probably be safer yeah yes and probably get them both hidden on the 

ship not talking to people in case anybody   starts asking questions yeah now also if 

nobody's got any objections could we do   a we halime break okay so yeah you guys 

eventually make it back to your ship to   

[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6136) droids um asch is easy to turn around it's 

just a will switch behind a panel on its back yep so you turn on does it's squeaky 

and it's booping and R R4 Fu his name is   the reason why R2D2 is always being 

is always making those squeaking and   B and and beeping noises is because he 

couldn't say anything without cursing   it's all censored everything's a 

sar exactly was all bleeped out 

[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6175) now go back and watch one of those movies 

and with that in mind it's just him cursing   the whole time yeah he's just cursing C3 and the 

droids seem happy in their new home Brian what's   that did the droids seem happy in their new 

home yeah they seem to be quite happy um it's   better than being cooped up inside a jaw sand 

crawler with restraining bols yeah sure d uh are we going to just out here with that thing 

that we've just found that little quiet little   

[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6212) thing sneak off this planet and then go look 

for another job just to be away from The Hot   Zone like we get that and go just get get away 

from that might be a good idea yeah yeah I think that will also clue us into whether 

the GM wants us to do that or not the ship   suddenly mysteriously crashed is just as 

we're about to take off yeah yeah if we   mysterious the crashes we're taking off we're 

supposed to be staying on T me we'll soon find 

[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6239) out um you can easily we we we we'll say your 

your Mandalorian friend is here and he easily   can pilot the ship to where you stash okay so is 

that the next day we're going for it yeah that   would be the next day okay so let's do that then 

we'll go out to the Stashia next day Y and it's   still there nobody's found it nice let's get that 

loaded up onto the ship and yep now that loaded   up into the cargo bay question would we have to 

fit that if we wanted that to be usable would we   

[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6283) fit it before we took off or is that something 

the Astromech can fit while in Flight um don't   it can be done in Flight there will be a point 

where you would need to land to actually give   the tube's access to the outside right okay 

so we do the first part on yeah land but then   we can take off and he can finish it yeah you 

could do it that way think should we do that   or should we yeah I think we should do that so 

that we've got it functional as soon as possible   

[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6324) okay I have no idea how to do any of that 

work I'm same I'm no engineer I just steal things let's see it's been a great first Adventure 

it's been a great first adventure for me so far I'm gonna have to actually get Max this website okay uh that's what it yeah it's a is this a repair rooll it is a 

mechanics rooll mechanics rooll mechanics   

[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6367) I have a three B base in intellect if I 

can if that will help I would do maybe   the should do it I've got a Bas in as well 

mechanics I've got one yellow two green   you got one yellow two green okay so you 

you're higher than me yeah what you got   got three green sorry I've got four green 

one yellow two green is is better or worse   than I'm assuming that's better it has more 

potential cuz you can get a Triumph yeah   

[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6399) whereas the greens can't get a Triumph okay 

um can I roll with an assist from asot then maybe oh the Astromech actually has two yellow 

oh so let's just let the astrak do it then eh   and you want to assist him and I'll assist 

him so uh R4 Fu can get his first job okay   so that gives him that and your skill so 

get them that he's bleeping all over the place okay 

[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6447) here we go this day he um yeah it's just he he's not 

used to this type of [ __ ] so yeah it um the protocol Dr translates for 

you guys that it he needs at least another day   or two okay that he might be able to get it 

can he do the rest in flight though yes okay   

[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6485) there's stuff he can do in Flight that's 

the important part right Mr Mandalorian   Mr sadly an NPC tonight because was more 

important than the game but uh Mr Max's   character we're going to get you to fly 

us out of here please yes and he does his   name I do have on screen somewhere I could 

tell you the name Max's character is vth zor so it's V ship V is our captain gu out here

that is sure but we are going to is viting skill I can sit in the co-pilot seat yeah and don't touch any buttons pretty well 

takes off no problem I'm I'm watching the   Astro M Droid do its work as it as it fits the

so does that actually little gra claw actually   has a fourth finger and it's always up so now 

I understand that in Star Wars RPG there is   ship on ship and flight combat and that will be 

a thing that proton torpedo launcher what would   it it's nasty it's lethal it's not a good quite 

it's well combat and this can be quite lethal Mo   most people use the The Minis game uh combat for 

ship combat from flight Penny flight uh what do   

[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3hBiU1S4c&list=PL_kRjOtxND3fHZX313eJWHmQXmaJSUe-g&index=2&t=6605) you call that game again my friend Johnny plays
